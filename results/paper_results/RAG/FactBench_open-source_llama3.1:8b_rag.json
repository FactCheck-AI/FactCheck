Specifically:\n\n* In the document labeled \"8.txt\", it is mentioned that Nelson Rockefeller married Margaretta Fitler Murphy (also known as Happy) at Pocantico Hills, N.Y.\n* In the document labeled \"31.txt\", it is stated that Nelson Rockefeller and his wife Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller agreed to an \"amicable\" separation after 31 years of marriage.\n\nFrom these mentions, I can infer that both Margaretta Fitler Murphy (Happy) and Mary Todhunter Clark Rockefeller were spouses of Nelson Rockefeller. However, the question asks about a spouse in New York City, which implies a more specific location.\n\nUpon further examination, I find no explicit mention of either Happy or Tod being a resident of New York City as their primary residence. While they may have had connections to the city through their association with Nelson Rockefeller's governorship and other activities, there is no direct evidence to suggest that one of his spouses was based primarily in New York City.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the available information, I must conclude that the documents do not provide sufficient support for the triple \"Nelson Rockefeller spouse New York City\". The value should be:\n\n`{'output': 'no'}`",
