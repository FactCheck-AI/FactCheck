Jack London was a superb natural athlete who clocked 10 second in his first 100y race and cleared 6-2 (1.88) in the high jump without any special training. Although he had yet to win an AAA title, he failed to win the 1928 Olympic 100m by less than a metre, after equaling the Olympic record of 10.6 in winning his semi-final. At the Southern Championships, he won the 100y (1926, 1928), 220y (1926), and high jump (1927). He was even more successful at the UAU Championships, winning both the 100y and 220y four times (1925-28), high jump (1925-26), and shot (1926), for a total of 11 titles. Born in British Guiana, he was brought to England when he was three months old and remained for the rest of his life. After reaching the final of the AAA 100y for the last time in 1930, he retired from track and pursued a moderately successful career on the stage and in films. In 1948 he wrote an instructional book aimed at the younger athlete. He was the first Briton to use starting blocks and was initially coached by Sam Mussabini, and later by Albert Hill. (Sam Mussabini was a major character in the film "Chariots of Fire. ed.)

Personal Bests: 100y – 9.9 (1926/28); 100 – 10.6 (1928); 200 – 22.2 (1928); HJ – 1.88 (6-2) (1927).

There is no mention why London did not attempt to run in the 200. ed.

Jack retired from athletics in 1930 but followed his talents as a pianist into a second career on the stage. His great niece who appeared on the Antiques Roadshow bit noted that he accompanied several Noel Coward productions in British theater. He also appeared in several films of a very stereotypical nature which will not be mentioned in this piece.

The question that several of our more astute readers may be asking is why there are three medals in the London collection when he only won a silver and a bronze. Where did the gold medal come from? His niece responded to that question saying that a replica third medal was acquired somewhere and it was gilded to make a complete set.

It was also mentioned that London went on to serve his country during WWII as an air raid warden and medic.

Oh yes, and how much were the medals valued for by the Antiques Roadshow experts? 3,000-4000 British Pounds.

Not taking anything away from Jack London's Olympic accomplishments, we must disagree with the conclusion of Antiques Roadshow that he was Great Britain's first Black Olympian. Earlier we reported on Harry Edward as having won the bronze at 100 meters in the 1920 Olympics.
