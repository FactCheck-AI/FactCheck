Swedes took four of the top five places but the gold medal came down to a very close contest between Ernst Linder and Bertil Sandström, the silver medalist from Antwerp. Sandström, on Sabel was placed first by two judges, with Linder, on Piccolomini, only ranked first by one, and they were tied on the scorecard from judge #3. But Linder’s total average points narrowly brought him the gold medal. This was Linder’s only Olympic appearance but Sandström would return in 1932 and win another silver medal in the team dressage event. That year he also appeared to have won another individual silver but he was moved to last place after it was alleged that he had made clicking noises to coach his horse.
