Well, jamie stuart failed not one but two test within one calender year while he was a player for charlton ( Cocaine and marijuana) and he still played for us! PS, Some have said that if Ricky otto had been tested in the 1994 season, he would have been banned for life!

Really? I seem to recall our former 'flying' winger was 'caught in possession' whilst at Brum (and who would have expected the West Midlands constabulary to have chosen to randomly stopped a black guy with dreadlocks driving an expensive car?) and suspect that his tendency to stick a little too closely to the 'white-lines' could have been the reason behind his decline, but at Southend he was awesome. Whatever he was taking here, must have been performance enhancing.

On the other hand I'd be tempted to try whatever Jamie Stuart was taking to get himself picked for England U-21, as he was cack for us.

Interestingly, Curbishley got Otto on loan from Birmingham...

Of course, Otto is clean-living now he's a probation officer in the Midlands, but we got him after he had done a bit of porridge for armed robbery...

I think that was a wind-up.

We all know he is really running a book-binding shop with his brother Mickey.
