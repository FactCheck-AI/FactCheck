Pioneering studies by Dr. Horvitz have made him one of the central figures in research concerning programmed cell death or apoptosis. He discovered that apoptosis is specified by particular genes and thus is a basic biologic process, much like cell division, cell migration, and cell differentiation. For this work and also for his studies of organ development (e.g., the EGF-RAS-MAPK and Notch pathways) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, he was awarded the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

More generally, Dr. Horvitz has studied how genes control many aspects of animal development and behavior, revealing mechanisms shared among organisms as diverse as roundworms and humans and that are implicated in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. In collaborative studies, he also has identified genes involved in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease that killed his father in 1989.
