uantum computing and quantum information science is a rapidly growing field that has sparked a lot of interest in the world. While the field itself and its applications are yet to be considered as mature, quantum technologies are expected to profoundly impact technology by completely revolutionizing the foundations on which technology as we know it today is built on. In this week's People in Computing ACM Selects, we spotlight key researchers and scientists making meaningful contributions to the development of quantum technologies. We hope that this first ACM Selects on quantum computing will help provide some context on the landscape of quantum technologies and some of the key directions that research in this area is taking.

We highly encourage learning more about their contributions, and invite you to consider participating in ACMâs activities on these topics, be it through our professional community,â global policyâ activitiesâ, ongoing work in âprofessional ethicsâ, and/or through our âchapters, âSIGsâ, âlocal meetups and/or âconferencesâ.

We value your feedback and look forward to your guidance on how we can continue to improve ACM Selects together. Your suggestions and opinions on how we can do better are welcome via email through selects-feedback@acm.org.

How 'Spooky' is Quantum Physics? The Answer could be Incalculable

First published in Nature, Vol. 577, 23 January 2020.

Most of us relate quantum physics with science fiction - Albert Einstein himself even dubbed a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics as being âspooky action at a distanceâ. It is an area that is generally perceived as complex, difficult to understand, weird but also cool.Â

â

To kick off this round of Selects, we hope that this ACM News article which conveys the complexity, weirdness and excitement behind quantum information science will spark your curiosity and inspire you to explore this area.

Algorithms for quantum computation: discrete logarithms and factoring

First published in SFCS '94: Proceedings of the 35th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, November 1994.

Perhaps Shorâs most outstanding contribution to the field of quantum computing is his discovery of a polynomial-time quantum algorithm, dubbed Shorâs algorithm. Although nearly 3 decades old, his discovery holds great significance. Given a âlargeâ number of quantum computers in the world, they would have the capability of breaking down the encryption techniques used on the Internet today.

Why haven't more quantum algorithms been found?

First published in Journal of the ACM, Vol. 50, No. 1, January 2003.

âNearly a decade after the discovery of Shorâs algorithm, Peter Shor observed that few quantum algorithms had been discovered and set out to find out why. In this paper, he sheds light on possible reasons for this and shares his thoughts on the directions that research at the time could take to yield the discovery of more quantum algorithms.

Quantum Computing Pioneer Warns of Complacency over Internet Security

First published in Nature, Vol. 587, 12 November 2020.

In this article, Peter Shor looks back on the moment of the Shorâs algorithmâs discovery and tells the story of the impact and perception that his discovery had on the world of physics and computer science at the time. While reviewing the current stage of development in quantum computing, he pondered the road to a post-quantum world and the potential state of unpreparedness it carries, emphasising the importance of ensuring cybersecurity is maintained to minimize the risk of unpreparedness.

Designing a quantum network protocol

First published in CoNEXT '20: Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies, November 2020.

âWe preface this ACM Selects by stating that quantum technologies will âcompletely revolutionize the foundations on which technology as we know it today is built onâ. As protocols are a core building block of todayâs networks, they will be required to evolve to support the functionality of and communication in quantum networks. In this paper, Wojciech Kozlowski, Axel Dahlberg and Stephanie Wehner present their design of a quantum network protocol developed to enable end to endÂ quantum communication and serve as a building block for future quantum-based services and applications.
