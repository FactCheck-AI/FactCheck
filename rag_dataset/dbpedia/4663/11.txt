Holy Wars is back and taking rock fans on a mind-bending roller-coaster ride with new single “Deus Ex Machina,” a fast-paced electro-infused track that taps into society’s unease about artificial intelligence and algorithm-driven art. A music video for the track arrived on Wednesday (Aug. 30).

Matching hard hitting metal riffs with frantic spoken word, soaring pop melodies, and thought-provoking lyrics, “Deus Ex Machina” is the next step in the evolution of Holy Wars, the long-running musical project from talented vocalist and anthemic singer Kat Leon and guitarist/producer Nick Perez, whose down-tuned guitar riffs and cinematic soundscapes have become the sonic signature for the group.

As in her past videos, Leon plays multiple characters in “Deus Ex Machina,” from the wide-eyed film director to an unhinged roller coaster patron taking a thrill ride created in her own image and dark psyche.

“Deus Ex Machina was inspired by my love of psychology and how fascinating the brain is. Deus Ex Machina meaning God from the Machine really helped shape the message of what I was wanting to say lyrically in this song, how our personal narrative is powerful,” Leon says. “We often rewrite our stories as the hero’s tale but we very possibly could be the villain in another’s. Our words are powerful and our story is our legacy. In this song I wanted to display the attack side of the narrative, how any issue I have had with another has stemmed from projection, a choice and the power I allow it to have. The ghost in the machine haunting my thoughts and puppeting my actions.”

“Deus Ex Machina” is the first single off the group’s upcoming EP on Pale Chord, the LA-based BMG-affiliated label released in partnership with Rise Records and home to fellow groundbreaking artists such as Spiritbox, Harper and Thousand Below.
