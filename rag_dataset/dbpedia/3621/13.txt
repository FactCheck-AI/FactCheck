The first time India hosted the Asian Games was in 1951 in New Delhi. Competitions were held in nine sports and saw participation from 11 nations.

India finished second behind Japan, with 51 medals – 15 gold, 16 silver and 20 bronze.

Asian Games 1982: A landmark for India

Asian Games 1982, the ninth edition of the continental event, were held in New Delhi from November 19 to December 4.

Since the first edition in 1951, the Games had grown exponentially over three decades, and the Asian Games 1982 saw more than 3,400 athletes take part.

The Asian Games Federation had been dissolved just before the commencement of the event and the ninth edition in 1982 was held under the Olympic Council of Asia.

A total of 33 nations competed, with medals awarded in 23 sports across 147 events.

The host city of New Delhi was given a lavish makeover to conduct the Games.

A swanky new venue, the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, was built specially for the event, new roads were constructed, and the old ones were widened.

The Indraprastha Indoor Stadium, Pragati Maidan, Shivaji Hockey Stadium and the Karni Singh Shooting Range were some of the other venues for the events. Sailing was held in the Arabian Sea, near Mumbai.

The 1982 Asian Games were significant for India and the continent because for the first time, the Games were telecast in colour instead of black and white. It was a massive statement of India’s advancement in broadcast technology.

The opening ceremony was held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, with 75,000 people in attendance.

Five-time Olympian Karni Singh, a shooting champion, was the flagbearer of the Indian contingent.
