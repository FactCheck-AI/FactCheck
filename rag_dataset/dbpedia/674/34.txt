As mentioned in the first post of this series, Adolf-Friedrich I ruled in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and it was his brother Johann-Albert II, who ruled as Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (May 5, 1590 – April 23, 1636).

From 1608 to 1611, Johann-Albert II was the nominal ruler of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; the actual ruler being the regent, his great-uncle Charles I. From 1611 to 1621 Johann-Albert II and his brother Adolf-Friedrich I jointly ruled the whole Duchy of Mecklenburg. From 1621, John Albert ruled Mecklenburg-Güstrow alone.

Johann-Albert II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

Mecklenburg-Güstrow was created for a third and final time with the partition of 1621, when Johann-Albert II received the Güstrow part of Mecklenburg.

(I) Johann-Albert II was married three times. His first marriage on October 9, 1608 was to his cousin Margaret-Elisabeth of Mecklenburg, daughter of Duke Christopher of Mecklenburg. The couple had the following children:

* Hans-Georg (1610-1660)

* Johann-Christopher (1611–1612)

* Elisabeth-Sophie (1613 – 1676) married Duke August II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

* Christine-Margaret (1615 – 1666)

* Charles-Heinrich (1616–1618)

(II) On March 26, 1618, Johann-Albert II married Elizabeth of Hesse-Cassel (1596 – 1625), daughter of Landgrave Mauritz of Hesse-Cassel. This marriage remained childless.

(III) Johann-Albert II married his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg (1600 – 1657), daughter of Prince Christian I of Anhalt-Bernburg, on May 7, 1626. The couple had the following children:

* Anna Sophie (1628 – 1666)

* John Christian (1629–1631)

* Eleanor (1630–1631)

* Gustaf-Adolph (1633–1695)

* Louise (20 May 1635 – 6 January 1648)

Johann-Albert II died in 1636 and was buried in the Minster in Güstrow. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, Gustaf-Adolph, by his third wife, Eleonore-Marie of Anhalt-Bernburg.

Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

Gustaf-Adolph, Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (February 26, 1633 – October 6, 1695) was the last ruler of Mecklenburg-Güstrow from 1636 until his death and last Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Ratzeburg from 1636 to 1648.

A minor upon his father’s death in 1636, his uncle Duke Adolf-Friedrich I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin at first became regent at Güstrow, fiercely opposed by Gustaf-Adolph’s mother. In 1654 he came of age and married Magdalene-Sibylle, a daughter of Duke Friedrich III of Holstein-Gottorp (1597-1659) and his wife Marie-Elisabeth of Saxony (1610-1684).

Magdalene-Sibylle of Holstein-Gottorp

Their marriage produced eleven children:

* Johann, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1655 –1660).

* Eleonore (1657 – 1672).

* Marie (1659 – 1701), married on September 23, 1684 to Duke Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

* Magdalene (1660 – 1702).

* Sophie (1662 – 1738), married on December 6, 1700 to Duke Christian-Ulrich I of Württemberg-Oels.

* Christine (1663 – 1749), married on May 4, 1683 to Ludwig-Christian, Count of Stolberg-Gedern.

* Charles, Hereditary Prince of Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1664 – 1688), married on August 10, 1687 to Marie-Amalie of Brandenburg-Prussia, a daughter of daughter of the “Great Elector” Friedrich-Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Prussia from his second marriage with Sophia-Dorothea of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, daughter of Duke Philipp of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.

* Augusta (27 December 1674 – 19 May 1756).

Hereditary Prince Charles, of Mecklenburg-Güstrow

The death of the only surviving son, the Hereditary Prince Charles, in 1688 at the age of 23, caused a succession crisis in Mecklenburg-Güstrow. Gustaf-Adolph’s daughter Marie married her cousin Adolf-Friedrich II of Mecklenburg, who after the death of his father-in-law claimed the Güstrow heritage, but could not prevail against the ruling duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Christian-Ludwig I. A younger daughter, Louise in 1695 married the Danish and Norwegian Crown Prince and in 1699 became queen consort of Denmark when her husband succeeded to the throne as King Frederik IV.
