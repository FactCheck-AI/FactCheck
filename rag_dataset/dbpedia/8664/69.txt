I often find, the simplest images get used on the best writers' books - in this case the wonderful Cormac McCarthy of The Road, All The Pretty Horses, No Country for Old Men, fame. This is one of his lesser known works. In fact it's almost a play and described as ‘A Novel In Dramatic Form’. It tells the tale of two nameless men, Black and White, as is their respective skin colours, who meet in New York. (Black has just saved White from throwing himself under a train) It's all set in one apartment and there's a lot of coffee drinking involved - hence the cover image. The Sunset Limited refers to train that travels from New Orleans to Los Angeles. This version of the book was published by Vintage, New York in 2006
