Laois Independent candidate Ollie Clooney, a farmer from Durrow, has ploughed his way back into the Borris-in-Ossory Mountmellick district, winning his seat for the second time.

He was hoisted high by supporters on the tenth count at about 8pm on Sunday evening, June 10, with three other councillors announced as reelected simultaneously: Paddy Bracken, John King and Seamus McDonald.

Cllr Clooney's number one votes came to 1245, and with transfers he was elected on 1,650 votes.

“It’s a brilliant feeling. For an independent man like me to win it. I had a few doubters who said ‘you won’t win next time’. So I said I’d run again and I’m after repeating it again.

“The support I got was unbelievable, from neighbours, friends and voters. Once I knocked on their doors, that welcome kept me going, despite the bad weather in spring.

“The next five years will go quickly. I look forward to it and I hope I do justice to my voters to repay them in their communities. I am a firm believer of more investment in rural areas,” he said.

He had associated with Fine Gael in the past but didn’t get party support to run on the ticket in 2019.

“I always felt there should be a candidate in my area of Durrow, Cullahill and Ballacolla. We were getting very little investment. There has to be a voice to get the slice of cake off the table that’s in county hall,” he said.

Being a counsellor is time consuming but worthwhile he said.

“I enjoy it, it’s unbelievable. I recommend it to anyone,” he said.

Cllr Clooney had a special word of thanks to a mentor who is unwell.

“Hughie Sheppard and me worked together in the community. He is one of my inspirations. My prayers are with Hughie, “ he said.
