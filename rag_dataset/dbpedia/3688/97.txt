Former LSU outfielder Dylan Crews is trying to make the Washington Nationals roster after being drafted second in the MLB draft last summer. So far in spring training, he is not disappointing.

The Nationals play in the Florida Grapefruit League, and on Tuesday they played the Houston Astros. After hitting a two-run double in the top of the third, Crews flashed the leather in center field in the bottom of the fourth inning.

Astros left fielder Corey Julks was batting for Houston and sent the ball to center field. Crews sprinted to get close and fully laid out to make the catch and end the inning.
