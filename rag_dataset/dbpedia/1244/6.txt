How much is the chef's menu? Also can guests just enjoy drinks in the green room without ordering food?

Le Fantastique does not offer outdoor dining. However, we have three different seating options inside: the main dining room, our Chefâ€™s Counter, and the Green Room - which is an intimate lounge space.
