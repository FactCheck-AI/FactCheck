Rock ‘n’ roll is a form of music that is primal, passionate, and rebellious.

It expresses the emotions of angst, anger, and lust in some of the only ways that are accepted by society. The history of this edgy music genre dates back to the 1950s. It was formed by a combination of the blues, gospel music, and country. Throughout the decades, rock ‘n’ roll has evolved and become famous for being the genre that’s continued to push the boundaries of music, and, sometimes, the cultural boundaries of society itself.

In the 1950s rock ‘n’ roll could be defined as rhythm and blues. In the 1960s it was partial to new musical styles such as folk rock and soul. And in the 1970s hard rock was born. From the 1980s to the present, technology has had an enormous impact on the music industry. Click here to visit a website that’s done a great job at chronicling the genre’s evolution.

Vocalist John Robb stated in his TED Talk, “Good taste is the enemy of the revolution.” This remark epitomizes the spirit of rock ‘n’ roll. You’re not expected to conform – you’re expected to be yourself…no matter what anyone thinks. You are admired deeply for expressing emotions such as anger, heartbreak, and sadness through music in a way that is embraced. John Robb, the lead singer for the rock band ‘Goldblade’ in Manchester, shared a TED talk that is incredibly inspiring and has the appropriate amount of dry humor and edginess you’d expect from a very influential rock star.
