The Stonewall Riots Anniversary is an annual event that celebrates the anniversary of the 1969 Stonewall Riots in Greenwich Village, New York City. The Stonewall Riots were a series of violent demonstrations by members of the LGBT community that took place from June 28th to July 3rd of 1969. The riots were spurred by a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. During the raid, police officers physically and verbally abused patrons of the bar, leading to a violent revolt that is widely recognised as the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement.

Every year, the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots is commemorated with a variety of events and activities. These events often include marches, rallies, and protests in support of LGBT rights, as well as educational panels, workshops, and performances. In addition, many cities throughout the United States and around the world also host their own Stonewall Riots Anniversary events.

How did the Stonewall Riots Anniversary first start off?

The Stonewall Riots Anniversary commemorates the six days of unrest that began in the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village. The raid sparked a series of protests and riots that lasted for six days and became a catalyst for the modern LGBTQ rights movement.

The Stonewall Inn was, in the 1950s and 1960s, one of the few places in the city where LGBTQ+ people could gather and socialise. On the night of the raid, police were looking for alcohol violations but instead of simply arresting the patrons, they began to harass and humiliate them, sparking outrage among the crowd. The patrons, tired of being treated as second-class citizens, fought back against the police.
