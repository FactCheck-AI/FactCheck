Gazaak is one of the three capturable bosses in Fire Emblem Fates. Gazaak might not seem like anything special but he has a 95% health stat rate! His max stats are also reflected so he can be reclassed into a health tank. While he cannot be reclassed into many other classes many capturable bosses have higher stats to reflect this seemingly high flaw. For example Gazaak cannot gain aptitude.
