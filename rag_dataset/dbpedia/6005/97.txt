As a major city, Reutlingen is located in the UNESCO biosphere area Swabian Alb. The unique cultural landscape of the biosphere area with its magnificent flora and fauna combined with the diverse leisure activities make Reutlingen a special experience.

Reutlingen's local mountain, the Achalm, offers a fantastic view over the Alb to the Black Forest. The old town invites to extensive strolling and shopping, while the medieval city wall, the Tübinger Tor and the Gartentor still bear witness to the former, mighty fortifications. One of the most beautiful buildings of the High Gothic period in Swabia is St. Mary's Church. Two thirds of the old town was destroyed in the great fire of 1726. In the course of the reconstruction, many small alleys were created as escape routes between the buildings. One of them is Spreuerhofstraße, the narrowest street in the world (width: 31 cm).
