Back in the late 90s, when her band Bikini Kill was close to breaking up, feminist punk icon Kathleen Hanna launched a messy, lo-fi, sample-heavy solo project called Julie Ruin and released a self-titled album in 1998 on Kill Rock Stars. It presaged the synthier music she'd soon make with Le Tigre. Now, Hanna has relaunched a new version of that project, a five-piece band called the Julie Ruin.The new band includes Hanna's former Bikini Kill bandmate Kathi Wilcox, Kiki and Herb member Kenny Mellman, Carmine Covelli, and Sara Landeau. The Julie Ruin performed at a Kathleen Hanna tribute show at Brooklyn's Knitting Factory last December. The band has a website, a Twitter, and a MySpace. And they're also recording. They've been posting studio photos on their website, and according to CNN, their album is due in January.

Below, check out footage of them playing new song "Cookie Road" at that Knitting Factory show.
