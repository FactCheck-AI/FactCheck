Biography

Francis Talbot is Notable.

Francis Talbot, 11th Earl of Shrewsbury was the second son of the 10th Earl. He was a captain of the royalist armies during the English Civil War.

He succeeded to the Title of 11th Earl of Shrewsbury in 1654.

Best known for dying from injuries sustained in a duel fought over his second wife’s numerous infidelities, Shrewsbury was the holder of one of the most ancient English peerages and head of one of the premier English Catholic families. With the earldom he also succeeded to the hereditary lord high stewardship of Ireland.

By the time of his succession, he had already distinguished himself as a loyal supporter of the royalist cause. He probably served as a volunteer in the First Civil War and rallied to the new king in 1651, when he commanded a regiment of cavalry. Following the defeat at Worcester, he fled abroad, but around the time of his succession to the earldom he returned to England, he petitioned Oliver Cromwell for pardon for all offences and sued for the return of his estate.

Francis married secondly Anna Brudenell (born on March 25, 1642 in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, England; daughter of Robert Brudenell and Anne (Savage) Brudenell). Their son and heir was Charles Talbot (1660–1718).

He died on 16 March 1668.[1]
