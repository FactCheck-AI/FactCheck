This DVD spotlights Andrew Hill, a great and arguably groundbreaking composer and pianist and is recognized as one of the most important progenitors of free jazz piano. His most-lauded work was recorded for Blue Note Records, spanning nearly a decade and producing a dozen albums. As a pianist, Hill had a flowing melodicism and an elastic sense of time. Like his composing, Hill's playing had an ever-present air of spontaneity and was almost completely devoid of clich. His album Dusk was selected as the best album of 2001 by both Down Beat and JazzTimes; and in 2003, Hill received the Jazzpar Prize (an annual Danish award for jazz excellence, held in Copenhagen).
