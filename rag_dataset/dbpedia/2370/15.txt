"Telling Me Lies" is Desire's first new outing since featuring on Club Intl's "Ride" single last month, and is accompanied by a video directed by Talvi Faustmann and Desire.

The new track will feature on Desire's Johnny Jewel-produced Escape album, which will follow their 2009 debut II and was written and recorded in Los Angeles and Palm Springs. Lead vocalist Megan Louise sings in English, French and Korean on the new album.

Escape will feature "Telling Me Lies" as well as earlier outings "Zeros", "Ghosts", "Haenim", "Escape", "Black Latex" and "Liquid Dreams".

"Telling Me Lies" is out now. Desire's Escape album will arrive via Italians Do It Better on 3 May.
