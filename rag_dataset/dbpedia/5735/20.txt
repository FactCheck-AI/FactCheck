Application by Astral Media Radio (Toronto) Inc. and 4382072 Canada Inc., partners in a general partnership carrying on business as Astral Media Radio G.P. (Astral) for a broadcasting licence to operate a new FM radio programming undertaking to replace the existing AM station, CHOR Summerland.

The new station would operate on frequency 98.5 MHz (channel 253A) with an average effective radiated power (ERP) of 20 watts (maximum ERP of 100 watts with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 348 metres).

The Commission notes a situation of apparent non-compliance relating to CHOR's transitional Canadian content development contributions in 2008. In Canadian content development commitments, Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2009-794, 22 December 2009, the Commission approved in part a payment plan proposed by Astral to remedy this issue and indicated that it would deal with the apparent non-compliance issue at the time of renewal of the licences for the stations involved. Since Astral's application to convert CHOR to the FM band requires the issuance of a new licence, the circumstances of the station's apparent non-compliance will also be examined in the context of the present application.
