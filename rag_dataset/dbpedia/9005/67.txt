We offer full-day in-person and virtual half-day camps for ages 8-18 from June through August. We have a wide array of workshop topics covering genres like fiction, poetry, scriptwriting, songwriting, and journalism. Our camps provide dedicated writing time, engaging exercises, and the personalized guidance of experienced, working writers. With only 6-12 campers per session, young writers receive individualized attention and thrive in a supportive, collaborative environment. More than just skill development, our camps foster confidence and a love for writing.

The Lighthouse Summer Writing Intensive is led by published and award-winning writers, and each workshop is designed to foster creativity, self-expression, and excitement about writing. During the week, young writers will work at length with a number of published instructors in a variety of genres and will leave camp with new knowledge about the craft of writing, at least one completed piece of work, and enthusiasm about pieces to come. Campers will be invited, but not required, to share a piece of writing in a public reading at the end of the week. Writers of all experience are welcome to apply!
