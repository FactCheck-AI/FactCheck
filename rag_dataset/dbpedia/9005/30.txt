Northwoods Writing Camp takes place in June on a Rainy Lake island, just outside of International Falls, Minnesota. There are three 5-day sessions during which teen girls work independently and in groups to write, critique, and build community. If you're a teen girl who loves writing and you're looking for an exciting summer getaway--this is the place, these are your people!

Experienced authors will welcome you to Atsokan Island on Rainy Lake. The lodging is woodsy and historical, but has all the creature comforts that a passionate writer enjoys. Not only are the surroundings and mentors inspiring, delicious meals are shared with lively conversation and memorable comradery. To learn more, explore the "Our Story" tab on this website.
