The Writing By Writers Manuscript Boot Camp is for the writer who has a full, book-length manuscript (novel, memoir, short story or essay collection) and would like to engage with a small group for a serious and productive response. The extended weekend will include an intimate manuscript workshop, craft panels, readings, and individual meetings – the perfect pre-publication boot camp for any manuscript. Classes are limited to 5 participants.

​

When: October 30 - November 3, 2024. Boot Camp is held at Sundance Mountain Resort in Utah.

​

Tuition: Full tuition is $4,500 which includes a manuscript review of up to 80,000 words ($100 for every additional 5000 words), 4 days of workshop, admittance to all panels and readings, and all meals and lodging in a private room for four nights. Writing By Writers would like to thank the faculty for generously reducing their standard reading fees (which range from $5,000 to $10,000 for a full manuscript) so that we may offer this workshop to you at a significantly reduced rate.

​

Lodging & Meals: Lodging is provided in shared suites with each person having their own private bedroom and bathroom. Please let us know if you require an ADA accessible room. Meals include dinner on Wednesday; three meals Thursday, Friday and Saturday; and brunch on Sunday. Vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free meals are available upon request.

​

Format: Classes are limited to 5 participants each and one workshop session is set aside for each manuscript. Each participant will have their manuscript read by their faculty member and their four peers. In addition, they will have a one-on-one session with their faculty member.
