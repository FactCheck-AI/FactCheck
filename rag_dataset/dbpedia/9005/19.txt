Registration for Wick Juniors Summer Camp has reached capacity.

This year we have a special opportunity for our Wick Juniors students. On Friday, July 12, U.S. Poet Laureate Ada Limón will be in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park to promote her project, “You Are Here: Poetry in Parks,” an initiative with the National Park Service and the Poetry Society of America. Ada Limón will meet with our Wick Juniors students for an hour that day along with other area students. We will have more details and information about this exciting experience soon.

Mission Statement

Wick Juniors offers opportunities for young writers to have a positive experience exercising their own capacities for self-expression.

Wick Juniors Writing Club began offering a summer camp in 2016. This camp is offered in partnership with the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Students entering grades 3 through 12 will experience one day with the Wick Poetry Center teachers at Kent State University, followed by a three-night, four-day stay at the Environmental Education Center (EEC) in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park.

Through guided hikes, pond dips, and more, the young writers will explore how the natural world influences our writing. A culminating reading will be held on the grounds of the CVNP.

Trained Wick Poetry Center teaching artists and the CVNP Environmental Education Center teachers will facilitate the camp activities.
