Welcome to The King’s Daughters’ Writing Camp!

The King’s Daughters’ Writing Camp is situated on 700 virtual acres of imagined picturesque landscapes with mountains, valleys, woods, streams, waterfalls, and miles of writing trails, paths, and meadows. A lake glimmers and sparkles in the sunlight inviting writers to take a break and go swimming, boating, or just sit by the water’s edge and chat as you watch the sunsets or the sunrises.

This camp is a gathering of Christian ladies from all over to focus on writing stories that honor God.

It was created by a group of writers who wanted a safe place for Christian ladies of all ages to connect with and encourage each other in our writing journeys without worrying about the offensive or unbiblical messages promoted by secular writing organizations.

The camp is run on Slack. (Each participant must create a simple account.) There are separate channels in which to chat with fellow writers, participate in writing sprints, get help on your story, and encourage each other. All information such as emails are kept private, and participants may use pen names if they so desire.
