Welcome to KSRESIN, a family-owned and operated business with a passion for innovation and an unwavering commitment to excellence. Since our humble beginnings in 2018, we have quickly risen to become a leader in the epoxy industry. Our journey began in Loveland, Colorado, and in 2023 we relocated to New Port Richey, Florida, where we continue to develop and release cutting-edge products that cater to the diverse needs of our customers.

At KSRESIN, we pride ourselves on our unique contributions to the epoxy tumbler industry, most notably the introduction of our revolutionary product, Liquidy Split Fast Set Epoxy, in 2020. As we continue to grow and expand our offerings, our epoxy resin products remain proudly made in the United States.

One of our core principles is the careful selection and utilization of high-quality raw materials. We refuse to cut costs at the expense of quality, ensuring that our products consistently meet and exceed industry standards. This unwavering commitment to quality extends to our production processes, where we maintain strict consistency to guarantee that our customers can always rely on the performance of our products.

As a family-run business, we understand the importance of building strong relationships with our customers and partners. We are grateful for the trust and support we have received, and we are excited to continue providing outstanding products and services for years to come.

Welcome to the KSRESIN family â€“ where creativity meets quality, and innovation thrives.
