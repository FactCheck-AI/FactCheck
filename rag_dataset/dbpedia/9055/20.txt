Gone are the days of standard linoleum flooring, these days even linoleum has changed. There are many choices from hard woods, to laminates, ceramic tile to recycled materials. There as many flooring styles as there are design ideas. From cork flooring which is resilient and warm, natural in appearance and environmentally friendly to flooring that can be heated to your comfort!
