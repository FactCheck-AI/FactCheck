What support is available to help me keep independent?

If you have a disability and/or experience difficulty completing daily tasks, you have a couple of options:

Community Equipment Service

If your needs are complex and you require long term support, you may be eligible for an Occupational Therapy Assessment, where prescribers such as an Occupational Therapist can work with you to find ways of managing tasks, offer advice and potential solutions. This is a local authority and NHS funded service, where Medequip provide the equipment on loan.

Equipment would be prescribed and loaned to you through the Community Equipment Service. Vital equipment is sourced and delivered to Service Users to support hospital discharges, avoid admission, and support the needs of Durham and Darlington citizens, with the long-term aim of keeping people independent and safe in their home environment.

To access equipment, you will need to have an Occupational Therapy Assessment. You can ask your GP for a referral or if you are to be discharged from hospital, an assessment can be arranged. To enquire or request an assessment, you can contact the Adult Social Care Team:

Durham County Council resident: call 03000 267 979

Darlington Borough Council resident: call 01325 406111
