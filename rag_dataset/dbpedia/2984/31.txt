Tegeler See is the second largest lake in the Berlin area, covering 450 Ha. It is located in the north-western corner of the City, just above the Tegel Airport.

Together with Havel, Wannsee and other bodies of water it forms a lake complex spanning from north of Berlin down south, surrounding Potsdam.

If you want to sit on a bench, have a picnic or just enjoy the view, than the place to go is the Greenwichpromenade, located on the eastern side of the lake, near Borgisturm.

If you are looking for something a little bit ‘wilder’, head south to Bernauee Straße, where you can find a little bit of forest and small cost beaches.
