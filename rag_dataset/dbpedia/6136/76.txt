Production has started on Series 7 of Michael McIntyre's Big Show.

It's been revealed that a new segment called Wheel On Wheels will see the star driving up and down the country on Saturday nights to find families who are watching his hit game show The Wheel.

When he has found a household watching The Wheel, McIntyre will knock on the door and give the family a chance to play along with The Wheel as they watch the episode play out on screen, offering the chance to win some impressive prizes.

Of the new segment, the comedian says: "I cannot wait to, literally, get the show on the road! I could be on your street on Saturday night, so make sure you're watching The Wheel and listen out for the doorbell!"

Michael McIntyre's The Wheel is on BBC One tonight (Saturday 23rd September) at 8:35pm. The new series of Michael McIntyre's Big Show is expected to be broadcast this winter.
