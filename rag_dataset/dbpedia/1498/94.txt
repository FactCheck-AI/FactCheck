Tragic news has struck the football world as former Super Bowl champion and Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker, Clark Haggans, passed away at the age of 46.

The somber report was made by Collin Dunlap of 93.7 The Fan, leaving fans and fellow players in shock and mourning. The cause of Haggans’ untimely death has not yet been disclosed.

Clark Haggans began his career as a fifth round pick by the Steelers in the 2000 Draft, coming out of Colorado State University. He went on to become an integral part of the Steelers’ defensive lineup and was a key member of the team that won Super Bowl XL in the 2005 season.

Haggans showcased his exceptional skills and determination throughout his career, which spanned 13 seasons in the NFL before his retirement in 2013.

During his tenure with the Pittsburgh Steelers from 2000 to 2007, Haggans had eight productive seasons, earning him a place in the hearts of Steelers fans. In the 2005 Super Bowl season, he contributed significantly to their success with an impressive nine sacks in 13 games.

In total, Haggans amassed 520 tackles, 46.5 sacks, 24 passes defended and 16 forced fumbles in his 172 game career.

After departing from the Steelers in free agency in 2008, Haggans continued his football journey with the Arizona Cardinals for the following four years. He played for the Cardinals during Super Bowl XLIII, where they faced his former team, the Steelers.

In his final season in the NFL, he joined the San Francisco 49ers in 2012, where he made one last Super Bowl run. Unfortunately, the team fell short against the Baltimore Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII.

Remarkably, Clark Haggans had the unique distinction of playing in three Super Bowls throughout his career, representing each of the teams he played for. He emerged victorious in Super Bowl XL with the Pittsburgh Steelers, etching his name in football history.

Beyond his accomplishments on the field, Haggans was a dedicated father, leaving behind a son named Damon and a daughter named Alianna.

In addition to his achievements as a player, Clark Haggans made a significant impact off the field by dedicating himself to charitable causes. In 2012, he became the first NFL player to support the Black Out Child Abuse Campaign.

This campaign, run by the non-profit foundation Black Out Child Abuse, Inc., aimed to bring education, assistance, and support to families and organizations across the country affected by child abuse.

Haggans passionately advocated for this cause, symbolizing his support by wearing blackout paint rather than the traditional stick-on eye black during games.
