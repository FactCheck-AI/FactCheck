Broderick Crawford (The Undercover Man) goes up against the Mob in this exposé of underworld involvement in America’s docklands.

After failing to apprehend a cop-killer, Detective Johnny Damico must rescue his reputation by going undercover on the waterfront. Disguising himself as a thug, he infiltrates the mobsters that are controlling the docks in order to uncover the identity of the mysterious boss.

Acting as a precursor to On the Waterfront, The Mob is a shocking thriller helmed by Robert Parrish (Cry Danger) and written by William Bowers (Larceny), and with acting support from Richard Kiley (The Sniper) and Ernest Borgnine (Bad Day at Black Rock).
