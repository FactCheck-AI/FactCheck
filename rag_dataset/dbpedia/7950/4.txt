Habitat

The Blue Triangle Butterfly is found in urban areas, forests and woodlands. Although preferring moist rainforest habitats, this species has survived well in Sydney's suburbs.

Distribution

The Blue Triangle Butterfly is found in Eastern Australia, from Torres Strait and Cape York in Queensland to about 160 km south of Sydney.

Feeding and diet

The caterpillars of the Blue Triangle Butterfly have adapted to feed on a variety of plants including the introduced Camphor Laurel, Cinnamomum camphora.

Other behaviours and adaptations

The green Blue Triangle Butterfly larvae rest on the upperside of the leaves and can be difficult to see. If the plant is disturbed, you are more likely to smell them before you see them. Many caterpillars in this family (Papilionidae) have an 'osmeterium', which looks like a fleshy horn that pops up from a slit behind their head and emits a strong smell. In this species the osmeterium is yellow, but in other species it may be red.
