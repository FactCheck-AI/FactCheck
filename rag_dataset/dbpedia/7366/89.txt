The team time trial had been on the Olympic Program since 1960, but this was the last time the event would be contested at the Olympics. This race was actually contested over 102.8 km. Italy had won the 1991 World Championship and brought the same foursome to the Olympic start line, but a combined German team was simply too strong and won the race by exactly one minute over the Italians. Italy would win the World Championship in 1993-94, and the event was then also discontinued at that championship.
