There were no changes to the men’s program, with five events – kilometre time trial, match sprint, individual pursuit, team pursuit, and points race. For the third consecutive Olympics, a women’s event was added to the program, this time the individual pursuit on the track, giving women two track events and one road event. Track cycling took place at the Vélodrom d’Horta. This was a 250.0 metre wooden-surfaced track with 43° banked curves and 13° banked straights and was outdoors, unlike in 1976, 1980, and 1988.

Estonian Erika Salumäe defended her gold medal in the match sprint, after having won in 1988 while representing the Soviet Union. German Petra Roßner won the initial women’s pursuit race. On the men’s side the titles were split among four countries, with Germany, Great Britain, Italy, and Spain winning one event each.
