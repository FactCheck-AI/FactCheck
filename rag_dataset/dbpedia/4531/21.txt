In 1990, alarming evidence of NATO-sponsored terrorist attacks came to light. NATO’s secret “stay behind” armies that were set up across Western Europe after the Second World War were supposedly intended to help put together a resistance if the Soviet Union invaded. However, they went on to commit terrorist attacks against their own populations, so as to influence domestic politics. The forces still exist post-Cold War. This film is the shocking story of Operation Gladio—a tale of espionage, conspiracy and political violence carried out by the United States.
