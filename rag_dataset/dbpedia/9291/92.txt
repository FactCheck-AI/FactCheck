Cher has revealed that she is unhappy with the way her record label have been handling her latest album.

The singer, who is signed to Warner Records, took to Twitter after reading a negative review about her latest single 'Take It Like A Man' and its accompanying remix music video.

"Just read mean TILAM ['Take It Like A Man'] review," she said.

"The video had nothing 2 do with me.I was told it would only be shown in gay bars.It's true WB's hasn't got a Great Deal of Interest In My CD.

"Not ALL,THERE R HARD WORKING ADORABLE PPL.,But Decision Makers Don't Seem 2CareThat Much. It's Ok YHSTLOM".

Cher released her 25th studio album Closer To The Truth in September last year and spawned the UK top 40 hit 'I Hope You Find It'.
