Bio

Redress Design Award 2014/15 finalist, Cher Chan launched her San Francisco based clothing brand, Seer the Label, in early 2018. The brand name derives from the definition of a seer: a person of enlightened insight who possesses visions of the future. Cher’s vision is clear and meaningful: the future of fashion is to be mindful and sustainable in the design process. Her sport-inspired debut collection reflects the sunny weather prevalent in where she splits her time: California and Hong Kong. Frequent travel between USA and Asia allows her to not only reach a larger audience, but also to explore her fabric sourcing options. Her womenswear and unisex collections are all up-cycled, made from deadstock materials from Hong Kong, Japan and USA. A Fashion Design graduate from Middlesex University, London, Cher previously interned for numerous Hong Kong fashion brands and designers, including Barney Cheng and High Fashion International.

I’ve realised my lifestyle greatly affects the environment and as a result I want to be a sustainable fashion designer to help to protect it. Through my designs, I hope to show the world my sustainable ideas and work to lower the negative environmental impacts of the fashion industry. - Cher Chan

Redress Design Award collection

Cher was inspired by the celebrated Chinese author Eileen Chang’s legendary literature and Chang’s personal fashion style for her Redress Design Award (formerly the EcoChic Design Award) 2014/15 collection. Cher used the sustainable design techniques of zero-waste, up-cycling and reconstruction onto her textile waste source, comprising end-of-roll recycled cotton and damaged textiles, which she sourced from fabric suppliers in Hong Kong, and secondhand textiles and clothes. The result was a collection featuring crocheted garments overlaying key pieces.
