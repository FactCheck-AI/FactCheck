Survival Thriller

NO WAY UP is a high concept combination of disaster movie and survival thriller, as characters from very different backgrounds are thrown together when the plane theyâ€™re travelling on crashes into the Pacific Ocean.

The stricken airliner comes to rest perilously close to the edge of a bottomless ravine with the surviving passengers and crew trapped in an air pocket. With their air supply rapidly running out, a nightmare fight for survival ensues as dangers from all sides hone-in on them.
