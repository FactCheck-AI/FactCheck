Common Celery Diseases:

a. Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria apiicola): This fungal disease manifests as small, dark spots with light centers on celery leaves. As the disease progresses, the spots enlarge and merge, leading to leaf yellowing and defoliation.

b. Early Blight (Cercospora apii): Characterized by circular lesions with concentric rings, early blight affects celery foliage, causing premature leaf drop and reducing photosynthetic capacity.

c. Bacterial Leaf Blight (Pseudomonas syringae pv. apii): Bacterial leaf blight causes water-soaked lesions on celery leaves, eventually leading to tissue necrosis and plant collapse under severe infection.
