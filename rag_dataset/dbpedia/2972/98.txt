Power metal gods release new album in August

Swedish Heavy Metal heroes SABATON are currently working on their new studio album, entitled The Last Stand, which is going to be released worldwide on August 19th through Nuclear Blast.

“We once work again with Peter Tägtgren in his newly upgraded and top class Abyss studio in Sweden to record, produce and mix the album. The mastering will be done by Jonas Kjellgren who also works in the same building in nice Pärlby on the countryside of Sweden. Both ‘Carolus Rex’ and ‘Heroes’ were done in the same way and we feel very comfortable to return to the same place and people again. Fans will recognize the sound of the album as SABATON, but we really feel we took it a step forward this time”, says Pär Sundström.

The artwork on the album is made by Peter Sallaí who has been with SABATONsince ‘Carolus Rex’. Pär Sundström explains: “We had the idea to make an image reflecting soldiers of different times representing the different historical battles we sing about on the new album. This only reveals a small part of the album topics though“.

“The concept of a last stand has always fascinated me, and both me and Pär were ”all in excited” about the subject so it was an easy choice to make”, says vocalist Joakim Broden about the album title ‘The Last Stand’. “We always have several ideas for albums to work with. Since there are countless different views and angles of war, we will unfortunately never run out of ideas. We kinda felt that the last stand was something perfect for SABATON. Something we really wanted to do. Heroes was a perfect theme and The Last Stand is right down our alley too. It was exciting to do the research”, adds Sundstöm.

Few more weeks until the final work is done. But everyone in the SABATON camp is more than satisfied. Joakim Broden sums it up: “Did any other artist ever say ”Our new album is the best we ever made”? That’s not for us to decide, that’s up to our fans…”
