THE LOOP â€” Part of Lake Street near North Wells Street in the Loop was shut down Saturday afternoon as crew members built a set for the movie, "Jupiter Ascending."

Filming was scheduled to begin downtown later in the evening, a crew member said.

The science fiction thriller stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis, who was spotted at the Taste of Chicago earlier this week. The movie by the Wachowskis is scheduled to come out next year.
