Norfolk Island: An emerald jewel in a sea of blue

From space This remote speck of lush green in the South Pacific Ocean is Norfolk Island.

The 8- by 5-kilometre island is the eroded remnant of an ancient volcano which was last active over two million years ago.

The island is part of an undersea mountain range called the Norfolk Ridge which runs off the east coast of Australia, extending from New Caledonia in the north, south to New Zealand.

The ridge is composed of Late Cretaceous continental crust which was once part of Zealandia, a submerged continent that sank 60-85 million years ago.

Norfolk Island is covered in lush green pine and rain forests, scarred with a giant grey X where the runways of the local airport cross each other.

Above the airport runways are the lush dark green rolling hills of the Norfolk Island National Park ,which covers the north-western side of the island and is home to Mount Bates, the island's highest point at 313 metres above sea level.

A patchwork of small settlements and farms can be seen dotted along the roads and across the landscape.

Norfolk Island is an Australian territory (postcode 2899), located 1412 kilometres east of the Australian mainland and about a 1000 kilometres north west of New Zealand.

The image was taken from an altitude of about 720 kilometres by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) aboard NASA's Terra satellite on November 12, 2009.
