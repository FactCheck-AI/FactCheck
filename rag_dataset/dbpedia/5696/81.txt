The mastermind behind Grey’s Anatomy is looking to expand her universe. ABC announced today that it has ordered a drama pilot from Grey’s creator/executive producer Shonda Rhimes and her longtime producing partner, Betsy Beers, that focuses on three stateside doctors who opt to work for an isolated tropical clinic. Dubbed Off The Map, the drama script is from fellow Grey’s scribe Jenna Bans and was one of several pilots that ABC ordered today. Others include a new drama called Body of Evidence from Chris Murphey (2004’s Dead Lawyers) that’s about a female medical examiner who used to work as a neurosurgeon, and a single-camera comedy pilot from ex-ABC topper Jamie Tarses and newcomer David Caspe that focuses on a couple that breaks up at the altar.
