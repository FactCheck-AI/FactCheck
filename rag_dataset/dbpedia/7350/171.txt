American football was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Olympics. It is not a recognized sport by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and it will not become a part of the Olympic Program at any time in the near future. One reason for that is that the IOC is committed to gender equity at the Olympics, and there are few womenâ€™s leagues or teams in American football, and almost none outside of the United States. Another factor against American football is how to fit in a tournament within the 2-week Olympic Program.

There have been some recent efforts to consider flag football, a variant of American tackle football, as an Olympic sport and at the 141st IOC Session in Mumbai, India in October 2023 flag football it was approved for the Olympic Programme for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
