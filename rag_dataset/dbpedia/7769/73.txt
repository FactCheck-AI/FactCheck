Bassist Bill Gould recently announced his band mates for a 2009 reunion of Faith No More. They are: frontman Mike Patton, Mike Bordin on drums, Roddy Bottum on keyboards, and Jon Hudson on guitar.

The 2009 reunion will commemorate the 20th anniversary of their most popular album, The Real Thing.

Gould goes on to comment about how the band decided to get back together. “Meanwhile, we find ourselves at a moment in time with zero label obligations, still young and strong enough to deliver a kick-ass set, with enthusiasm to not only revisit our past,” says Gould, “but possibly add something to the present.”

Does this mean we could see new material from Faith No More?

As of this report, concert dates are planned only for Europe, where FNM had a large fan-base back in the day.
