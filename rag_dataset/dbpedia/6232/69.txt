I just saw it.

Let me say, most importantly, that this isn't a gambling movie. It is about a mid-level advantage player, mainly poker but also blackjack, but the gambling is only touched on lightly. The movie is very badly named and I feel misled.

The movie is about the guards who worked interrogating and torturing prisoners in Iraq in the early 2000's. Their lives come together years after the fact. That is about as far as I'll take it. To go further might violate forum rules on political and controversial speech.

While I can't fault the movie on any technical level, it simply wasn't enjoyable to watch. I'm normally one to like dark movies, but I felt I was being tortured to watch it. However, I had to see how things would end, so I stuck with it.

Perhaps I'll write a longer review later. However, for now, please don't see this movie because it's a gambling movie. IT'S NOT!
