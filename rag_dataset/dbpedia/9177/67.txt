Billboard is a trade and consumer music publication based in the United States.

Founded in 1894 as Billboard Advertising, it hosts an annual music awards â the Billboard Music Awards â in addition to other events.

Billboard is perhaps best known for its weekly charts, including the Billboard 200 albums ranking and the Hot 100 singles chart, which are powered by MRC Data (formerly Nielsen Music).

In September 2020, ownership of Billboard was transferred from prior owner MRC to a new entity, PMRC.

Fellow MRC brands such as The Hollywood Reporter and Vibe were also acquired by PMRC, in addition to Penske Media Corporation (PMC) titles.

Penske Media Corporation (PMC) is the majority stakeholder in PMRC, which also owns Variety, Rolling Stone, Deadline, The Hollywood Reporter.

PMRC also owns an interest in Music Business Worldwide.

Said PMC founder and CEO, Jay Penske, at the time: âThese are all brands Iâve long admired. Billboard, The Hollywood Reporter, and VIBE have created some of the finest content in their respective industries and have contributed immensely to the heightened quality of journalism covering entertainment and music today.

âWe feel very fortunate for this valuable partnership with the exceptional MRC team and the opportunity to continue the legacy of these tremendous brands for the next many decades.âMusic Business Worldwide
