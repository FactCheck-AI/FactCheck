The actor is played by Klaus Maria Brandauer in one of the greatest movie performances I've ever seen.

Mephisto seems somewhat remote, without all the urgency of which Mr. Szabo has shown himself capable.

Dennis Schwartz Movie ReviewsDennis Schwartz

A compelling melodrama, essentially a revisiting of Goethe's version of the Faust legend, revised for the pre-war Nazi rise to power period.

Winner of the 1981 foreign lingo Oscar, Szabu's modern Faustian take is rather conventional in story and ideas, but it has strong emotional pull due to Brandauer's bravura performance.

Gone With The TwinsMike Massie

While the film runs slightly overlong, it never gets tiresome, thanks to Brandauer's haunting performance.

San Francisco ExaminerJudy Stone

It is an astonishing, discomfiting portrait of a type who places success above an else.

Boston GlobeBruce McCabe

Istvan Szabo's Mephisto is brilliant metaphorical filmmaking containing one of the more memorable film-acting performances in recent years.

TIME MagazineRichard Schickel

Few have dared what Brandauer accomplishes: showing us a good actor responding to the same neurotic drive for the center of the stage, the immortalizing role. His is a great performance, nothing less.

VarietyVariety Staff

Hungaro pic shows extraordinary period flair for the Germany of the 1920s and '30s, balanced acting by a multinational cast, and exemplary direction.

Washington City PaperPat Padua

Mephisto is a powerful parable about fame as a disease of the spirit.
