Rammstein frontman Till Lindemann is ready to go it solo this fall, announcing his first-ever North American solo tour.

Though previously working under his last name in the band Lindemann, this will truly be the singer as a solo artist. The trek spans 14 cities, kicking off Sept. 17 in San Antonio and continuing through an Oct. 14 finale in Los Angeles. The run will also include one festival appearance on Sept. 27 at the Louder Than Life festival in Louisville.

Lindemann will add to the live spectacle by bringing along Twin Temple and Aesthetic Perfection as the support acts for the tour.
