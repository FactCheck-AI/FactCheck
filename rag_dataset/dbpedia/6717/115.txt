A fundraising event called 'Send your PA to Lunch' was held by St Margaret's Hospice on Friday 24 October 2008.

The charity targetted 80 PAs from the most successful companies in Somerset because PAs often have an overview of their companies' dealings and if there's money available for charitable donations.

Multi-millionaire businesswoman, Deborah Meaden, who lives in Somerset, took part because it celebrated the role of PAs within the workplace and it also raised money for a cause she believed in.

Essential service

Although Deborah hasn't had to call on the service herself, she knows people who have and believes the charity provides an essential service for patients and their families.

"They manage to make it as comfortable (as possible), if there can be laughter in the last moments of peoples' lives that is so important.

"They create that environment that allows people to live their last days, rather than waiting to die."

The charity was set up in 1980 and helps people with illnesses ranging from cancer to motor neurone disease and chronic lung disease.

It receives 19 per cent of its funding from the government, while the rest is made up through donations.

"I think our NHS struggles..(without the hospice) I think there would be a huge burden on families.

"When all of this happens it's incredibly emotional, and an incredibly difficult time, so without the support I suspect there would be a lot of long term damage done to relationships and to families that would be very difficult to recover from."
