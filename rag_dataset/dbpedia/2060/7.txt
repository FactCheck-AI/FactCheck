Austin Tolliver meets a milestone in his artist career with the release of his 12-track debut album, “Ride 4 Me.”

Built with uptempo country and hip-hop infused songs, Tolliver confidently entertains with title track, #Ride4Me, #YodelayYouDown #TipMyHat and Lifestyle, Featuring Colt Ford.

Meanwhile takes an earnest approach with #Amnesia and #CrashCourse, a song swerving between lyrics and comparisons of a break-up ”while I’m begging you to put it in reverse.” The entire album is available on all streaming platforms with a select few tracks featured as Official Music Videos on #YouTube.
