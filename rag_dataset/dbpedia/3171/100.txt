We all know that Montana is a beautiful place. Because of that beauty, our state is a highly sought after place for filming movies. I'm sure we can all count on one hand some of our favorites that we know were filmed in the Treasure State. You can probably count on all your fingers and toes, all the movies you didn't know where filmed in MT. One movie, in particular, is the 1974 film "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot." This movie starred two young actors that are still making magic on the silver screen. I'm talking about legendary actors Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges.
