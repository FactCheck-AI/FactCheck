Born in Miami, Yvette D. Bennett is the youngest of two children. Her father was in the Air Force which caused the family to move quite often. This gave Yvette the opportunity to meet many people, and live in many different places which helped to spark her creative side. She began writing stories and directing people at a very young age. It's no wonder she has chosen to be a writer/director.

As a BFA and MFA graduate from film schools in Atlanta, Georgia and Orlando, Florida, Yvette has been fortunate to have worked with many award winning and award nominated actors. She continues to hone her craft while being involved in a combination of feature films, streaming series, short films, commercials, reality shows, and sports segments as a writer, producer, director, or asset manager.

It is Yvette's dream to write and direct for television and film. She is well on her way to achieving that dream.
