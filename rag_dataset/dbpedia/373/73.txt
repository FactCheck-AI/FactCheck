What's everyone's favourite record store in the city? For new and used? Of the ones I've been to so far:

Blackbyrd: So far, my favourite, its nice and small with a really easy to browse (albeit small) used section in the back. Easy to flip through and the ones on the ground aren't too overwhelming or hard to sift through. Usually had what I was looking for.

Sloth: I liked their new section but their used section being underneath is LARGE and expansive and hard to get to honestly. I started looking through it and soon gave up.

Recordland: I haven't gone through their used section, but I like their new section, organized and easy to find things, though I found I've had the best luck at Blackbyrd looking for my particular artists.

I still have to check out Melodiya (since its on 17th I can incorporate it into my record store rout) and I personally don't really like Hot Wax. I've been in a bunch and just haven't found anything I've been interested in whenever I go in.
