Westmoreland Country Club will play host to the Windy City Collegiate for the second straight season, hosting on a par-72, 6,219-yard course Monday and Tuesday. Founded in 1911, it has played host to the Western Open, the Western Amateur and both the Chicago District Golf Association's Women's Championship and USGA Women's Amateur Championship. The original 1912 course design by William Watson has undergone several renovations, most recently by Arthur Hills in 1993.

Purdue has competed in six of the seven previous events, hosted by Big Ten Conference rival Northwestern, winning the first three events, and placing ninth in an elite field last season. August Kim was the Boilermakers' top finisher in 2014, tying for 13th place at five-over, 221, for the event.
