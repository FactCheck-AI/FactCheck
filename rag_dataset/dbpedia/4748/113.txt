MINNEAPOLIS, MN -- Republic Airways Holdings says it will buy Midwest Airlines. The struggling Milwaukee-based carrier had already hired Republic to do much of its flying.

Republic is buying the airline from TPG Capital. It says it expects the deal to close in one month to six weeks.

Republic says it will replace all of Midwest's Boeing 717s with Embraer 190s planes.

On Monday Republic said it has offered to buy Frontier Airlines out of bankruptcy.

Republic operates a regional airline under its own name as well as Chautauqua Airlines and Shuttle America. It does regional flying for several major carriers.
