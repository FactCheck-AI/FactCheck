In the 2005 WCh in Russia the goal of the Austrian team is to advance to the main round of the best 12 teams, which will not be an easy way. The Preliminary Group is one of the hardest groups  Denmark, Poland, Germany and Austria will fight for 3 tickets for the main round although you must not forget Brazil as a very strong opponent. During the preparation for the WCh the Austrian team had also to suffer some injuries of key players and could almost never play with the full team. The task of the Coach Herbert Muller is to form a good team out of a few international experienced key players and of many young players who are almost for the first time at a WCh.

World Championship

In the last ten years, Brazil took part in all the World Championships and the best placement was the 12th conquered in 2001, in the Italy World Cup. Other results were:

1995 - Austria / Hungary  18th place

1997  Germany  23rd place

1999  Norway / Denmark  16th place

2001  Italy  12th place

2003 - Croatia  20th place

The work and the investment that has been done in this period has the main goal of improving this placement in the Russia World Championship in December.

Pan-American Championships

If in the World Championships, the Brazilian Handball still fights to be among the great potentials. In the American continent, however, there is no competitor: Brazil is undoubtedly the best Pan-American team. Champion twice in the Pan-American Sport Games, 1999 and 2001, the Brazilian womens team have been preparing to reach the third podium in the Pan-American Games in Rio de Janeiro/2007.

Brazil has also five titles in the Pan-American continent, which were achieved in 1997, 1999, 2000, 2003, and 2005.

Our women team won the 6. place on the World Championship that took place in Germany in 1999. After 1999 our team faced some problems. Teams faced some radical changes and with the success of junior players Croatia comes back to throne in 2001. The Junior Selection won the bronze medal on the European Junior Championship in France 2001. The rejuvenated team tries to find its way to the European and World handball scene. Unfortunately, the results were not satisfying. In 2004 through the qualifications against Bulgarian team, our team gain the possibility of participation on the European Championship in Hungary in 2004, but the result was again poor. In spite of that team continued taking part in great tournaments, and after winning the qualification match against Swedish team for the place on the World Championship in Russia 2005.

Finally, 2005 is the year that again brought us success by winning the bronze on the Mediterranean Games in Almeira, Spain. That is the definitive proof that our Women handball team is very respectable and will have important place on the world handball scene in the future.

The World Champion of the year 1993 got in serious trouble at the beginning of this century. After missing the qualification for the Olympic Games in Sydney and the World Championship in Italy in 2001 Ekke Hoffmann took over the nationalteam for the third time. Step by step he managed Germany to come back to a high level  for example shown at the European Championship last year in Hungary with the 5th place. Since February Armin Emrich is responsible for the nationalteam.

Important players like pivot Kathrin Blacha, defender Nikola Pietzsch and playmaker Heike Schmidt (Emrich's new assistant coach) resigned after a long international career. The World Championship in Russia will be the first important step for the new and young generation with players like Nadine Krause on the long way to Bejing 2008.

The Dutch handball federation

Several years ago, the Dutch handball federation NHV initiated a new course under the slogan from recreational sport to top sport. In the knowledge that handball could prove to be a goldmine, the decision was made to get to the heart of the game, to play an appealing, surprising and dynamic game whereby not only speed and creativity, but also joy and freedom (in restraint) set the tone. In this sense, the game perfectly matches the social characteristics of the Dutch people.

At the end of 1999, Dutch handball experienced its greatest success yet in Norway. The ladies team came tenth in the World Championship, winning four of the six matches and demonstrating top class handball. Dutch handball teams had participated in earlier title competitions, but never so convincingly as at the World Championship in Norway.

At the beginning of December, the Netherlands became aware of the womens striking performances. Their attractive game, their dedication and good image and their mediagenic qualities were remarkable. The sports television programme with the highest viewing figures in the Netherlands, NOS Studio Sport, opened on Sunday with handball, broadcasting the match against Romania in the pre-quarter finals live. Two years later, the Netherlands had a disastrous start by the World Championship in Italy with a draw and two losing games with one goal. In the eight finals came a disappointing end with a 23-21 defeat against Sweden after an equal match. Now they are looking forward to the European Championship in Denmark,

Handball is one of the few branches of sport on television that have increased in popularity in the Netherlands. Handball appeals to a wide audience. Young and old, men and women, people with all levels of education are united.

The Dutch internationals are real top sports people. It is purely a question of extra training and coaching in duels with trendsetting club teams and foreign national teams. The movement of the lady players to foreign leagues makes them all the fitter for the top. Twenty internationals are already playing in the HandboldLig?n, the strong Danish league, the German Bundesliga and in Spain.

In addition to top sport, the Dutch handball federation also considers recreational sport important. Top sport and recreational sport are inextricably linked. The quality of recreational sport is determinant for top sport and vice versa. Providing an attractive range of facilities to various different target groups has led, after a period of some years when members dropped out of the federation, to an upward trend and a definite increase in the number of members.
