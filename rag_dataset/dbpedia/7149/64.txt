Rawat was summoned to New Delhi after an unscheduled Uttarakhand BJP core committee meet on Saturday presided over by the partyâs national vice president and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh, which sparked rumours of a possible change of guard in the state.

NDTV quoted reports to say he was rated “below average” by BJP MLAs, who felt that his leadership would bring down the party in the 2022 Uttarakhand polls.

Another reason behind uneasiness among a section of leaders with Rawatâs leadership is the issue of Cabinet expansion. While the state can have 12 ministers, as per rules, the Rawat-led Cabinet has seven Cabinet and two junior ministers with independent charge. The India Today report claimed the party may expand the Cabinet amid woes aired by some leaders.
