He's been a morning voice on local radio for years. And now, Jack Horton is headed to the West Virginia Broadcasting Hall of Fame.

Horton has been the morning air personality at WVVV (V-96.9) since 2000.

He's also known for his involvement with a variety of local charities, including those for law enforcement groups and activities.

His local broadcasting career began back in 1979, and, since then, he's seen a lot of changes in the radio business.

"And at that time, you still played vinyl on turntables, carts, which were like 8-tracks, everything was analog. Phones still had cords on them. So, you've gotten to see the advancement of the digital age with radio," Horton says. "I've seen so much over the last several years, working with law enforcement, raising money for K-9's, working with the humane society, so many different charities. So I've been able to accomplish an awful lot over the years."

Horton has also been recognized for helping advance the careers and record sales of artists ranging from John Denver to Taylor Swift.

Congratulations also go out to Tony Cavalier, chief meteorologist for our sister station, WSAZ, also among the seven who will be inducted into the Hall of Fame September 30 in Huntington.
