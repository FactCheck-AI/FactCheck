This text offers 6th - 12th grade educators guided instructional approaches for including young adult (YA) literature in science and math classes in order to promote literacy development while learning content. Chapters are co-authored, pairing content experts with literacy experts, to ensure that both content and literacy standards are met in each approach. Each chapter spotlights the reading of one YA novel, and offer pre-, during-, and after reading activities that guide students to a deeper understanding of the content while increasing their literacy practices. While each chapter focuses on a specific content topic, readers will discover the many opportunities reading YA literature in the content area has in encouraging cross-disciplinary study.

INDEX OF SUBJECTS

This is valuable text that will help craft middle and secondary students' understanding of science. Each science contributor partnered with a literacy expert to include pre-reading, during-reading, and post-reading strategies with young adult books to increase and deepen students’ understanding of various scientific concepts. This work readdresses the need for the practical application of subject matter in an approachable, easily understood manner.

— Dana L. Zeidler, PhD, distinguished professor of science education at USF; past president, NARST; co-editor, Journal of Research in Science Teaching

The authors demonstrate how to develop students’ literacy skills within content instruction and also provide meaningful illustrations that support teachers in understanding the subsequent benefits regarding students’ content knowledge. This book is a must read for all middle and secondary teachers!

— Angela T. Barlow, PhD, professor of mathematics education at MTSU; editor of NCSM Journal of Mathematics Education Leadership

After reviewing this work, I thought to myself: ‘How I wish it had been available two semesters ago!’ The chapters figuratively ‘read themselves’ due to the authors’ engaging writing style and their expertise in the field.
