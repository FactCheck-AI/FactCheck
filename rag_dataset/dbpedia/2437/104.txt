Rose Tremain has been awarded the Orange Prize for Fiction at a ceremony in London for The Road Home, about an eastern European immigrant seeking work in Britain.

She beat out five other authors, including three debutants, for the 30,000 pound ($61,000) award, open to female authors writing in English whose works were published in Britain in the past year.

The 64-year-old was also awarded a "Bessie" - a limited edition bronze figurine - for the novel, her 10th, at the ceremony at the Royal Festival Hall.

Tremain was the only nominee who had previously been shortlisted for the prize, having failed to win in 2004.

The Road Home tells the story of Lev, a migrant from eastern Europe who arrives in London speaking little English, having no job and barely any money.

It follows the 40-something man as he copes with Britain, and deals with the life he left behind.

"I think we all felt it was a fantastic exercise in empathy," said Kirsty Lang, chair of the judging panel for the prize.

"She [Tremain] succeeded in putting herself in the head of an Eastern European migrant in contemporary Britain. She managed to tell the story in a very powerful way. It's a male character, it's a man in his 40s. She absolutely gets inside his head."

Of Tremain, Lang said: "She is at the top of her game. You can see that in the writing. She knows her craft."

The other shortlisted entrants were Nancy Huston for Fault Lines, Sadie Jones with The Outcast, Charlotte Mendelson for When We Were Bad, Heather O'Neill with Lullabies for Little Criminals and Patricia Wood for Lottery.

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie won the 2007 prize for her book, Half of a Yellow Sun.
