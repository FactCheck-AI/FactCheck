When it comes to breathtaking and technically masterful nature films, nothing tops what BBC Earth produces. And now, they have announced five more incredible TV series are on their way, including "Planet Earth III."

The five titles that were announced are "One Planet: Seven Worlds," "Perfect Planet," "Frozen Planet II," "Green Planet," and "Planet Earth III." According to BBC Earth, filming involved over 10,000 days traveled across 120 countries. On the five series, they said that audiences can expect "unmissable drama, pioneering discoveries, and stunning spectacles that will change our relationship with the planet."

In a post to Instagram, renowned wildlife photographer and filmmaker Tim Laman said, "Itâ€™s going to be an awesome few years ahead for wildlife films." Laman said he was part of the crew that filmed the first of these five new series, "One Planet: Seven Worlds," which comes out this fall.

"One Planet: Seven Worlds" will be presented by the legendary David Attenborough. As you may surmise from the title, this series features each of the seven continents showcasing their unique wildlife and celebrates our diversity. It will also discuss the challenges that these animals face in the modern human-saturated world.

"Planet Earth III" will be released in 2022 and is claimed to be "the most ambitious natural history landmark ever undertaken by the BBC." If you get goosebumps thinking about the previous "Planet Earth" series, you're not alone. In the last three years, "Planet Earth II" and "Blue Planet II" have been watched by over a billion people.
