Painting by Andrew Melrose, Westward the Star of Empire Takes Its Way - Near Council Bluffs, Iowa, 1867. Signed bottom right. European-Americans of the late nineteenth century saw themselves as living in a fundamentally transformative time; change was a major theme of art that depicted frontier settlement as a process of nation building. Progress entailed loss as well as gain, shown here by tree stumps where the wilderness once stood. Melrose painted this picture in celebration of the railroadâs arrival in Council Bluffs, suggesting this was a small price to pay for the coming of civilization. In Andrew Melroseâs painting, the wilderness on the right side of the image is transformed into a pioneer homestead, as the darkness gives way to the rosy dawn of a new day. Fueling this process is the engine, its headlamp burning bright as it leads the way for future settlers.
