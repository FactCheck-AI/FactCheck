About: Lewis Nkosi. The Black Psychiatrist / Flying Home

Lewis Nkosi: The Black Psychiatrist / Flying Home is dedicated to the astounding South African writer and literary critic Lewis Nkosi (1936–2010). In this book, Nkosi’s celebrated one-act play “The Black Psychiatrist” is published together with its unpublished sequel “Flying Home,” a play on the satirically fictionalized inauguration of Mandela as South African president. Critical appraisals, tributes and recollections by scholars and friends reflect on the beat of his writing and life. An ideal book for those encountering Lewis Nkosi for the first time as well as for those already devoted to his work.
