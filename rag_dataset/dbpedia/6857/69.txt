RAN by Akira Kurosawa

A story of greed, a lust for power, and ultimate revenge. An elderly warlord abdicates as ruler in favor of his three sons, and the two corrupt ones turn against him. Set in feudal Japan, this retelling of “King Lear” is an amazing accomplishment in film. (1985, 162 minutes) Japanese language with English subtitles.

Doors open at 6:30pm. Admission Free! Cash Bar.
