Background

MGM Television was established on June 30, 1956 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer under Loews, Inc. It was initiated to have MGM to distribute 770 of its films, 900 shorts, produce network series, and acquire TV stations after its first program, The M-G-M Parade, was canceled by ABC in the spring. The M-G-M Parade first used the 1953 version of Jackie at the beginning rather than the end of the program. Most of the pre-1986 library is owned by Warner Bros. Entertainment through Turner Entertainment Co., while Amazon MGM Studios owns the rest of the library.

1st Logo (September 20, 1957-October 2, 1960)

Visuals: On a dark (or gray) background, there is a brown (or drawn) statue of the MGM logo, as seen on movies from 1924-1983, sitting on a pedestal. There is text seen over the statue saying "AN MGM-TV PRODUCTION" (or "AN MGM-TV PRESENTATION"). The name of the executive producer is seen below.

Variants:

On The Islanders, the text "MGM-TV" zooms in from the center.

On Northwest Passage, the 1953 version of Jackie in the standard MGM film logo appears at the beginning with a voice-over saying "From the MGM Studios in Hollywood..."

Technique: A printed graphic.

Audio: The closing theme of the show.

Audio Variant: On The Islanders, a voice-over says "A MGM television production".

Availability: Seen only on three series: Northwest Passage, The Islanders, and The Thin Man.

This logo was also retained on recent airings of the latter on GetTV.

2nd Logo (September 18, 1960-1973)

Visuals: The logo starts with Leo the Lion (from the 1957 movie logo) inside a black circle border, which reads "METRO-GOLDWYN-MAYER TELEVISION". The lion roars once. The background either has wallpapered images of a lion's face or a live action background.

Trivia: The same image was used as the print logo of MGM Records until 1966. Like the film logo, the original footage of Leo without the border is currently lost due to the vault fire.

Variants: These are the main color/B&W variations of this logo:

1960-1962: Live-action backing. On National Velvet, the logo is placed on the background of the credits. Then the logo disappears in an iris-out effect, while the show's title (in quote marks) appears in an iris-in effect.

September 19, 1961-May 15, 1962: On Cain's Hundred, the logo is placed on the background used from the show's credits. Another version has Leo's face off-center. The same effect is used for the first season of Dr. Kildare, with Blair General Hospital in the background, as well as season 2 of National Velvet.

1962-May 16, 1966: Gray wallpaper backing (on black & white shows).

1965-1973: Red wallpaper backing.

1965?-1973?: Brown wallpaper backing.

On color variants of the logo, the footage of Leo is zoomed out further than usual, revealing more of his body. His tail is also visible.

The way Leo roars varies. On the first versions of the logo, he roars twice like in the movie logo. The standard version is just his first roar, while Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas uses his second roar.

Technique: Live-action footage, with a printed graphic composited over it.

Audio:

1960-1961: A three-note drum sound followed by a dramatic fanfare played by a trumpet, synced to the animation of the lion roaring: the audio of the roar is replaced by a loud vibration of a muted trumpet as part of the fanfare. On National Velvet, this is followed by a three-note loud trumpet theme when the show's title is wiped on-screen.

1961-1973: Leo's 1957 roar track.

The ending music to the show plays throughout on some series; on others, there is silence while Leo is roaring.

Audio Variant: On a re-run of The Asphalt Jungle, a voice-over says: "The Asphalt Jungle, A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Television Production".

Availability:

Seen on Dr. Kildare, The Travels of Jamie McPheeters, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Courtship of Eddie's Father, Please Don't Eat the Daisies, and Medical Center, among others.

This logo is also intact at the end of the 1972 TV movie Hollywood: The Dream Factory, included as a bonus feature on the Warner Archive Blu-ray release of Dance, Fools, Dance (1931).

It survives on the Dr. Seuss cartoon specials How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (plastered by the Warner Bros. Pictures logo on NBC broadcasts) and Horton Hears a Who!, and was also seen on reruns of The Tom and Jerry Show on Boomerang during the 2000s.

It was also seen also on TBS airings of the former special and is also intact on the MGM/UA Home Video release thereof.

This logo was last seen on the series Assignment: Vienna.

It was also seen at the end of some Films Incorporated movies, like Wolves and The Wolf Men, Wildfire!, and Hollywood: The Dream Factory.

It was also seen seen on the unsold pilots Dream Wife, Meet Me in St. Louis, and possibly Take Me To Your Leader.

Most MGM TV series from this era are now owned by Warner Bros. Television (via parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's acquisition of Turner Entertainment Co. in 1996), so many current prints of these shows have the 1987 Turner Entertainment "Globe" and the Warner Bros. Television "Shield" logos, following the MGM Television logo, while series not owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (such as the original Flipper) may have it replaced with the 2001 or MGM Domestic Television Distribution logos.

This logo was last seen on The Man From U.N.C.L.E. on Heroes & Icons, which the network stopped airing in August 2017.

Legacy: A visually distinct logo from other MGM logos of the time, this is a favorite of many.

3rd Logo (May 18, 1969)

Top of cylinder

Visuals: Over a black background is the 1966 MGM stylized lion print logo, which has some shiny marks inside of it. It then flips over, revealing it is on top of a crystallized cylinder, to reveal the large, blocky text "MgM", with "TELEVISION" in smaller writing underneath it, and the stylized lion inside the "g" of "MgM" (which is "cut out" in the middle of the two "M"s).

Technique: Stop-motion model work.

Audio: Tanner's first roar.

Availability: It was originally a custom logo seen on The Pogo Special Birthday Special. However, it was only seen on original NBC airings and film prints of the special. It is removed from future prints and was not seen on home media releases.

Legacy: This logo was lost media for decades and very sought after, enough so that it was written off as a myth by some. However, it finally resurfaced in 2023 when X user Marc Acrylic uncovered the logo. A common nickname for the logo was "The Cold-Cream Jar", due to the cylinder's thickness.

On the TV movie The Fifth Missile, it used an abridged version of the 1982 lion roar.

On a few Hungarian TV prints of Daktari, the 1979 logo featured various roars from the 2nd logo, due to sloppy plastering.

On The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show, there is a slightly different roar track heard alongside the closing theme.

Availability:

The earlier variant was seen intact on Shaft: The Series, Logan's Run, and earlier episodes of CHiPs.

Although there is one existing episode on YouTube, posted by former child actor Rob Arbitelle (who appeared in the show as one of the grandchildren), it is currently unknown whether or not the remaining videotapes of The Montefuscos still survive (in which case the show would lie with Warner Bros. Television/Turner Entertainment Co.), or if NBC "wiped" (erased) said tapes of the program to use for other shows.

6th Logo (1982-June 15, 1984)

Visuals: A still picture of MGM/UA's then-corporate logo. Below "Entertainment Co.", which is separated from the MGM/UA text by two lines, is "Television Distribution": it's in the same font and uses the same style as the "Entertainment Co." text, and it's spaced below the aforementioned text.
