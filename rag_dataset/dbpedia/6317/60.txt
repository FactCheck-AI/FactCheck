Many of the most famous war films that come out of Hollywood focus, in one way or another, on America, and this makes sense, considering how frequently the US has been at war. However, when one looks beyond the American film industry, there are a number of great films which focus on wars in which the US had no official involvement, which can be engaging for those with less familiarity with these conflicts.

No matter what country they originate from, these films often feature powerful performances from their casts, and some are remarkably accurate in their depictions of armed conflict, immersing the viewer in the brutal and ugly world of war. As such, they are potent reminders of just how central war has been to the human experience.
