The Toronto Raptors signed their 2004 first-round draft pick Rafael Araujo on Saturday.

Araujo, a six-foot-11-inch centre, was the eighth overall selection in the NBA's recent entry draft.

Financial details were not disclosed, but under the terms of the NBA's collective bargaining agreement, Araujo was in line to sign for three years at up to $6.7 million US.

The Raptors said Araujo will play in the Minnesota summer league in Minneapolis from July 6-10.

"We are excited to have Rafael and have him join our summer league team," said Toronto general manager Rob Babcock. "This will be a good opportunity to expose him to our basketball philosophy."

Araujo split his four-year collegiate career between Brigham Young and Arizona Western Community College. In two seasons at BYU, he averaged 15.1 points and 9.5 rebounds. Araujo also averaged 14.9 points and 9.5 boards at Arizona Western.

The native of Brazil was named co-Mountain West Player of the Year last season after leading BYU with 18.4 points and 10.1 rebounds per game.
