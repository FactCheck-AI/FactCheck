Penguin Modern Classics is bringing a “completely camp” American 20th century bestseller to the UK for the first time in August.

Auntie Mame: An Irreverent Escapade by Patrick Dennis was first published in 1955, becoming a huge New York Times bestseller selling over two million copies. The comic novel was also a recent success in Italy, where it is said to have sold 400,000 copies since publication last year.

The book tells of an orphaned 10-year-old boy, sent to live in New York with his only surviving relative, the eccentric and glamorous Auntie Mame, who brings him up in her own idiosyncratic style. The character of Mame was based on Dennis’ own aunt, Marion Tanner.

As well as a popular book, Auntie Mame became a film (starring Rosalind Russell), a Broadway musical (starring Angela Lansbury) and a movie musical (starring Lucille Ball).

Penguin Press described the book as a “completely camp, hilarious and glorious work of love, style, wit and life”.

The author, who also wrote a follow-up, Around the World with Auntie Mame, went on to become a butler to the stars in Palm Beach in the 1970s.
