Next reorganization of the group became with leaving of Karel Zich, in season 1973/74. Spirituál started to show with tramp group (later named Brontosauři) with brothers Jan and František Nedvěd and Zdenka Tosková. Next year leaved Jarka Hadrabová and came Eva Lifková.

In 1980 Eva Lifková married and went to Francie, in its stead became Irena Budweiserová. Very short time, we had seen also Lenka Slabá and Jan Nedvěd in the group.

During revolutionary events (November 23, 1989), the group sang on Prague squares, (two presidents sang with them Vaclav Havel and George Bush senior). For next american president Bill Clinton, the group showed in Reduta in January 1994. In this time, the member was Karel Zich again. František Nedvěd became in 1992 after his brother after recording of album Rajská zahrada.

In 2000 Olda Ortinský leaved Spiritual, came Jirka Cerny, who was band-master of music band C&K Vocal.

Year 2004 was written by black letters to the history of this band. This year, exactlu in July 13, their member Karel Zich drowned in the Medi, during his diving trip. It wasn´t the first time, what the band lost one of the members (two of the foundation-members, manager of the band), but it was the first time, what Spiritual had to say good-bye to one of the youngest members from actual arrangement.

It was very hard leave-taking. Karl Zich was great singer and player (his nick was Elvis Presley of Czecho-Slovakia).

In September 2004 became Jiří Holoubek to the band from Relief.

The next member Oldřich Orlický dead in May 3, 2006.

This music band was established in autumn time in 1960 by four members of Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, mainly by initiative of Ivo Mach, nick name Dědek (Granfather). It was man quartet. Members were Miroslav Keller (tenor – nick Velký Bubo (Great Bubo)), Miloslav Kastelovič (barytone – nick Kagan, or Malý Bubo (Small Bubo)) and Jiří Tichota (usually bandmaster – nick Tichák).

The first public presentation came after 2 years, on International Jazz Festival in Karlovy Vary. The name was Spiritual Kvartet and this band was the first folk music band in Czechoslovakia. In that time, the word “folk” was unknown in this area. That’s why they present themselves on jazz concerts, usually with band Junior Trio, S+H Quintet or Tradiotional Jazz Studio P. Smetáčka. With last band they recorded some albums for recording studio Supraphon.

It was so long time ago, when they had listened american legend music band The Weavers. From that time, they wanted to be like them. After Věra Nerušilováwho was also a member of band Incognito Kvartet, Růženka Helebrantová (nick Odetta) came in and from that time here is Kvintet. Later the band had more members, but the name didn’t change more.

From 1964 Spiritual Kvintet had periodic program in Theathe Na Zábradlí. In 1967 two members Mach and Keller leaved band (they went on long-term business trip abroad). Next year (in August) Růženka emigrated to Swiss.

Everybody thought this would be end of this band but it didn’t. In 1969 came Karel Zich and Jarka Hadrabová. The band showed also with Olda Ortinský Dušan Vančura and Honza Thorovský (he substituded Kagan who returned to Slovakia).

This membership existed only 4 years, but during this period the band wined recognition on country and folk festivals (Porta 70, Golden Tele 71). Also they changed scene to Theatre Atelier. They released their first albums in czech Písně amerického západu and Písničky z roku dva.

As I said more times (try to see Rangers, Taxmeni, Greenhorns, Fešáci), came normalization and everything pertinated with it. Club were closed, some students had to leave Faculty, band had to finished its activities. Fortunately only for shot time.

On Saturday, the country world lost one of his members, the famous and memorable singer Waldemar Matuška.

He won recognition by his low and flannelly voice. Death cause was pneumonia and heart failure. He died on Florida, May 30, 2009, aged 76.

His success in 60-teen became with song Suvenir. As one czechoslovak agency wrote about him: “he has hoodlumy sex appeal, beard, evil-eyes and sparkle by energy, he was oposite of his show-business college Karel Gott”. And Waldemar said: ” I m type of vagabond, tramp and singers”.

Maybe it is destiny, but this weekend I was on one country action. Some friends met, played guitar, sang. We played many songs of him. It was shock to came home on Sunday evening and got to hear that bad news.

Waldemar, Walda, will always of my heard. For ever.

Unfortunately I can’t offer you any video, I was able to find nothing.

It’s very difficult to find some information about himself. But I got something from two different visitors of blog. Please be kind to apologize this pure introduction of Andy. Thank you a lot.

“Andy Mullen sports the rich baritone of Crash Test Dummies’ Brad Roberts and a sense of humor somewhere between Bob Newhart and a classic cast of Saturday Night Live. “

Performing Songwriter

Andy Mullen plays music that he describes as, “folk fusion,” but don’t get the wrong idea, there is nothing sedate or staid about it. Rather, his music bursts out of the speakers in a stream of imagery and sound, and Mullen’s command of his craft is so palpable that in listening, one immediately knows they are hearing an artist with his own unique vision of life and music.

“His clever lyrics will instantly grab your attention, but behind the humor is a man with a fierce intelligence and the soul of a poet. His ability to fashion the insane beauty and unexpected heartache of everyday life into short, well-crafted songs with catchy melodies and sharply etched image is remarkable.”

PlanetOut.com

Featuring his exceptional finger-picking style on guitar, the songs’ arrangements are uncommonly skillful, with light and subtle touches, like the fiddle and djembe on Sun Goes Up, Sun Goes Down, and the galloping banjo on Quit Quittin’, all which inspire a quiet sense of joy and wonder.

The utterly moving So Does The Beer tells the story of the death of his father, who died while he recorded the album. The song is an affectingly wry observation on love and loss; his vocals perfectly convey the balance of sadness and acceptance, while never succumbing to excessive sentimentality.

“Simple and stunning acoustic folk.”

Hybrid

But the album is also a showcase for Mullen’s wry and subtly wicked sense of humor, befitting an artist who calls himself “Folk Music’s New Bad Boy.” “Crooked Deck” inspires a multitude of smiles, in his description of himself as a man in possession of only, “The same rhyme all the time/Smokes and jokes and a dozen lines/They say that all I ever sing about is booze.” It’s ironic without being at all jaded, and in that, it is utterly invigorating.
