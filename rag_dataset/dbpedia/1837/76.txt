The dub's existence was first teased on July 18, 2021 in a post by Facebook page "Scene Stealers Celebrity Appearances" announcing that they were taking bookings for the English cast of Gintama to appear at comic conventions.[1] The image in the post featured the Crayon Shin-chan character Nene among the roles of Crystal Lopez, a Miami-based voice actress, as well as Shinnosuke for Christina Jopling.

Notes[]

The dub is almost directly translated from Japanese. This results in phrases like "Buri Buri" (Shinnosuke's butt dance) or "Dada" (a tantrum) being retained.

Much of the dub's cast is reprised from the English dub of Super Shiro, which was also recorded at Universal Cinergía Dubbing.

The first two seasons are rated 7+ on Amazon Prime Video, while the last two seasons are rated 13+.

When the dub was first released, episode 11 mistakenly used the audio from the previous episode, and episode 20 mistakenly used Chinese audio.

The first episode's audio is delayed by a second, which has not yet been fixed.

All seasons except for "Toy Wars" are interlaced for unknown reasons, which has not yet been fixed.

Shiro is credited in the second episode of "Toy Wars" despite the fact he does not appear in the episode.

The song Love is Over in episode 15 is replaced with a generic instrumental lullaby due to being a licensed track. Despite this, Shinnosuke still requests Action Mask Gold to sing the original song.

Early mixes of episode 35 and the song from episode 17 were posted to Vimeo by Universal Cinergía Dubbing in 2021, a full year before the dub's release. They would be made public some time in 2023.

At this time, the closing theme was not dubbed.

The dub has forced subtitles for on-screen text on the service.

The English subtitles currently provided for all four seasons of the series use identical scripts to the dub, although some users have reported that directly translated English subtitles are also available.
