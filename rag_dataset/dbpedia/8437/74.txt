Be more Malawi is a luxury menswear brand, but spiritually linked to the tribal culture of the country that gives the brand its name. Malawi believes that being well dressed goes beyond good sewing, or good material, the connections that each person has with their spiritual side goes through being comfortable and being able to make Mother Earth proud. The entire creation of the brand and its unfolding was designed to convey the simplicity and culture of Africa.

The logo was created for this project and the entire unfolding of the brand identity, institutional items and packaging material for mailing. The whole concept of the brand and a duality of luxury and simplicity of the people of Malawi.

by mother earth

We are worthy of spiritual sustenance in the form of clothing.

Our clothes warm and comfort the soul of a rich people without riches. Wealth is in the simple moment of connecting with culture. The glow of being unique and authentic. Be proud of me mother earth.

Be more Malawi is not a brand, it never had that pretension.

B.M.M was born with the dream of being a cultural manifesto, with hundreds of years of history of the African people running through our veins, it was only a matter of time before we screamed for everyone to notice us. Happiness in the midst of social chaos, struggles and tribes that are alive in every conscious Malawian. We live on the sustenance of our culture and the world needs to experience the sensation of dressing in the eternal glories of our people.
