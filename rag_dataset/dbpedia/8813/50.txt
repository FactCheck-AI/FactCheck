Signalbox diagram from Hadiscoe Junction. The location is between Reedham Junction and Lowestoft. The single track chord runs uphill to join the line between Yarmouth South Town and Beccles at Fleet Junction with the chord running west to south. The Yarmouth to Beccles line passes over the site at right angles on a bridge with Haddiscoe High Level station. Marsh Junction was also the start of a second east to north chord which joined up near St Olaves Swing Bridge.

Haddiscoe is right in the middle of the Broads, with very little other than the wildlife and the odd boat passing for company.

I was once told an amusing tale of a drunk chap who turned up at Norwich late on a winter Friday wanting to go to Haddiscoe. The booking office checked that he really did want to go to Haddiscoe. 'Yes' came the inebriated reply he definitely wanted to go to Haddiscoe. They just managed to pack him off on the last train and tipped the guard off to wake him up when they got there.

The next morning a rather cold, damp and sober chap reappeared at the ticket office. He was a little annoyed that the booking clerk had been so cruel to him last night when all he wanted was to go to 'a disco'...

This signalbox and the diagram is preserved at Mangapps Farm in Essex. Well worth a visit for any enthusiast.
