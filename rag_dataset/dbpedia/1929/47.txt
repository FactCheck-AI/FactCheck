The Swedes will begin their qualification run in Group 8 as they first travel to Slovenia on 13 November before they welcome Estonia on 16 November and then Ukraine on 19 November.

Simon has turned out seven times so far for The Bees in the 2019/20 season, with Fredrik playing six times so far. Both players look set to join Neil MacFarlane’s side for their short tour of Spain before they link up with their national team.

Simon has recently been involved with the under-18 side for Sweden and will be looking to push himself into contention as the under-19s look to secure qualification for next year’s tournament which is held in Northern Ireland.

As for Fredrik, having struggled with an injury in the early stages of the 2019/20 season, he’ll be looking to get some game time with his national side as he looks to continue his comeback.
