France Bleu is the network of local public radio stations in France. With its 44 radio stations throughout the country, it is the global medium of proximity that covers all the news and initiatives of a city, a department, or a region. As radio advertising is limited on the Radio France group's stations, the small amount of advertising space allows the advertiser's message to emerge more clearly.

Advertising on France Bleu radio is one of the best ways to reach a local target, especially if it is women aged 65 or more, as they make up half of the channel's audience. It is also an excellent media to promote an event in a locality or region to reach a large targeted audience.

A few figures on the radio :

5th radio station in the 6am-9am time slot in PDA*.

4th radio station in France in PDA in the 9am-12pm slot*.

France Bleu radio advertising offer

Classic advertising: the format of a radio advertising spot is very short. Broadcast during commercial breaks, this type of advertising is ideal for carrying out a local communication campaign (promoting an offer, communicating about the opening of a shop, etc.).

Tailor-made advertising: depending on your needs and your targeting, tailor-made systems can be proposed.

Radio sponsorship: this allows an advertiser to be associated with a program or a column on Radio France Bleu in the form of an 8-second maximum quote.
