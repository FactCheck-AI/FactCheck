New York’s oldest restaurant survived a 1775 British cannonball attack and a 1975 bombing by Puerto Rican terrorists — but it’s wobbling in tough economic times.

The current eatery operators of Fraunces Tavern are bailing out effective Saturday, say the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York, the nonprofit that owns the iconic downtown building.

The organization is scrambling to replace the current restaurant operator, the investment group 54 Pearl St. Associates, named for the building’s downtown address.

It’s possible the restaurant may be closed for a week while the new operator sets up, said Anthony Wellman, of the Sons of the Revolution.

But he expects any closing will be seen as but a blip in the tavern’s history. “There’s been a restaurant there on and off since 1762. We don’t expect that to change,” Wellman said.
