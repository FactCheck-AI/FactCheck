Very interesting to see, both the hills and the reconstructed medieval village. The village seemed to be built with traditional handtools, very impressive work indeed. There was boards with info in both Lithuanian and English so it was easy to understand what you are looking at.

Unfortunately the archaelogical museum was closed Mondays and Tuesdays.

Kernavė is the first capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania mentioned in historical chronicles (the second half of the 18th century). The hill forts of Kernavė are unique in the entire Baltic Sea region, as there are five on just one location. An impressive view of the turns of the Neris River, the island of the river and its banks open from it. The Archaeological and History Museum of Kernavė in which artefacts of the ancient times found during the excavations carried out in the course of several decades are collected, is also a location that attracts crowds at midsummer and on the Days of Living Archaeology in July, celebrating ancient crafts every year. During these Days masters of ancient arts from Lithuania and neighbouring countries – boot makers, potters, glaziers, jewellers, blacksmiths, furriers, beekeepers and others show their skills and sell their products. During the festival a demonstration medieval fights and concerts of ethnic music are held.
