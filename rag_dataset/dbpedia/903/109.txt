ANKARA, Turkey â€” The European Union is facing increasing pressure to speak out against the erosion of media freedom in Turkey following the takeover of the country's largest-circulation newspaper, but few expect it to take a bold stance toward Ankara while trying to assure its help in dealing with the migration crisis.

Police used tear gas and water cannons for a second day Saturday to disperse hundreds of protesters who gathered outside the headquarters of Zaman newspaper. Law enforcement officers stormed the building Friday to enforce the court-ordered seizure of the publication, which is linked to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's top foe, U.S.-based opposition cleric Fethullah Gulen.

A number of protesters were injured.

An Istanbul court appointed trustees to manage Zaman and its sister outlets, further reducing the number of opposition media organizations in Turkey, which is dominated by pro-government news outlets.

It raised alarm bells over the deterioration of rights in the country that aspires for EU membership, just days before a March 7 meeting in which EU leaders will try to convince Turkey to do more to curtail the flow of migrants traveling to Europe.

"The EU countries are preoccupied with their migration crisis, they are no longer concerned by rights violations in Turkey," said Semih Idiz, columnist for the opposition Cumhuriyet and independent Daily Hurriyet newspapers. "They'll say a few things as a matter of form, but they know they are dependent on Turkey."

Zaman's seizure was part of an intensified crackdown on Gulen's movement, which the government claims is attempting to topple it.
