Sky Stream, the puck-sized streaming box, is launching on Sky Italia.

Stream is the sister product to the Sky Glass integrated TV that runs on the Entertainment OS software. It will launch in Italy on June 3.

Andrea Duilio , CEO of Sky Italia, said: “In a world where people have more and more choice, almost half of consumers say they have difficulty deciding what to watch. Precisely for this reason Sky Glass was born which, with its cutting-edge operating system, allows you to solve this problem and save time. Today, with Sky Stream, we bring this innovative experience to any TV, giving everyone the opportunity to find the right content between the various apps, Sky and the main free-to-air channels in a simple and immediate way. Choosing what to see will be really easy for everyone.”

In the Italian market Stream provides access to all Sky content from apps including Netflix, Disney+, Prime Video, DAZN, RaiPlay, Discovery+, Paramount+, Apple TV+ and Mediaset Infinity as well as the main free-to-air channels in a single interface.

Functionality includes pausing Live TV and Restart including the FTA channels. Each member of the family has a personal playlist where they can collate their favourite content.

The arrival of Sky Stream will be accompanied by a cross media campaign that will be released shortly.
