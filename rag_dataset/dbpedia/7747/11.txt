Kuyper helped establish The Free University of Amsterdam in 1880, which was a school founded on the Reformed tradition.

Probably Kuyper’s most famous quote: “There is not one part of our world of thought that can be hermetically separated from the other parts, and there is not an inch in the entire area of our human life of which Christ, who is sovereign over all, does not cry, ‘Mine!’”

Kuyper was not just a pastor theologian. Others have called him an entrepreneur, a politician, a statesman, a journalist, a professor, and a political organizer.
