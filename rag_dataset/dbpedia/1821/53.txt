Results

With just two days of competition per Mare Nostrum Tour stop, we have back-to-back stacked racing on the agenda each of those days here in Barcelona.

The fields have filled out a bit more than the first stop in Monaco, which means we have even more talent on which to keep an eye as the races transpire.

Already this morning we saw a solid morning swim from the reigning 200m free Olympic champion Tom Dean, with the British swimming logging a 2free top seed of 1:46.89. He’ll be chased by the likes of multi-Monaco title winner Matt Sates of South Africa and Olympic medalist Fernando Scheffer of Brazil, not to mention World Championships medalist in the event Katsuo Matsumoto of Japan.

A highlight of the women’s prelims came in the 100m breast, with German national record holder Anna Elendt staking her claim on the event with a big-time 1:05.82. That results sits just .24 outside of her national standard and lifetime best of 1:05.58 the Texas swimmer logged just this past March.

We’ll see what Elendt has in store tonight when she races in the final against the #1 swimmer in the world in the event right now, Reona Aoki of Japan, the reigning Olympic gold medalist Lydia Jacoby of the United States and the rest of the field.

A showdown in the men’s 50m free among some of the best in the world is also a marquis race, with Bruno Fratus (BRA), Ben Proud (GBR), Thom De Boer (NED), Michael Andrew (USA) and more in the mix.

MEN’S 800 FREE – FINAL

GOLD – Joris Bouchaut (FRA), 7:53.03

SILVER – Marc-Antoine Olivier (FRA), 7:53.53

BRONZE – Daniel Wiffen (IRL), 7:55.16

The French earned the first gold medal of this Barcelona stop of the 2022 Mare Nostrum Tour, with Joris Bouchaut getting to the wall in a time of 7:53.03 in this men’s 800m free.

That gave him the edge over teammate Marc-Antoine Olivier who was exactly a half second behind in 7:53.53 while Ireland’s Daniel Wiffen grabbed bronze in 7:55.16.

Bouchaut owns a lifetime best of 7:52.37 in this event, so tonight’s swim checks in less than a second away from his career’s quickest performance.

WOMEN’S 50 BACK – FINAL

GOLD – Kylie Masse (CAN), 27.47

SILVER – Ingrid Wilm (CAN), 27.85

BRONZE – Analia Pigree (FRA)/Silvia Scalia (ITA), 27.89

Reminder, whereas the stroke 50’s were contested as skins at the Monaco stop, the 50’s here in Barcelona are swum as prelims/finals.

Canada went 1-2 in this women’s 50m back, with national record holder Kylie Masse clocking a time of 27.47 to lead Ingrid Wilm who touched in 27.85.

Masse owns the national record in a swift 27.18, a mark she produced at this year’s Canadian Trials. The 26-year-old Masse has broken this record 3 times in 2022, having swum a 27.62 at the Trials Prep Event in March to take out her own 27.64 from the 2017 World Championships. At that same meet, Masse posted a 27.52 to bring down the time by another 0.10. before settling into the 27.18.

We also saw our first tie of the meet, with both French swimmer Analia Pigree and Italy’s Silvia Scalia earning bronze in 27.89. Pigree owns the French standard in 27.39 while Scalia’s Italian record stands at 27.66.

Behind Osman’s 25.73 was Swedish standout Louise Hansson who touched in 26.03. Hansson represents Loughborough, as that is where the former USC Trojan moved her training base as of 2020.

For perspective entering this meet, Henique ranked as the 4th fastest performer in the world in this event, owning a season-best of 25.62. As such, the 29-year-old managed to shave another .05 off of that result to remain in that spot.

MEN’S 400 IM – FINAL

GOLD – Matt Sates (RSA), 4:11.58

SILVER – David Verraszto (HUN), 4:13.54

The former University of Georgia Bulldog nearly cracked Hungarian icon Laszlo Cseh’s long-standing meet record of 4:11.22, a time that’s been on the books since 2008. Sates’ head-turning effort here also nearly overtook the reigning South African national record. That time stands at the 4:11.11 former Florida Gator Sebastian Rousseau logged in 2011.

Spits for Sates’ effort here are below, with Hungarian mainstay David Verraszto coming in with 4:13.54 for silver while two-time Olympic finalist in this event, Max Litchfield of Great Britain rounded out the top 3 in 4:16.21.

WOMEN’S 100 FREE – FINAL

GOLD – Marrit Steenbergen (NED), 54.16

BRONZE – Maggie MacNeil (CAN), 54.38

Dutch Short Course European Championships gold medalist Marrit Steenbergen got it done for the top prize in this women’s 100m free, producing the fastest time of 54.16.

Opening in 26.22 and closing in 27.94, 22-year-old Steenbergen of the Netherlands just put up the 5th fastest performance of her career. Her personal best rests at the 53.97 she hit at the inaugural European Games in 2015. She then took a break to focus on her studies while tonight’s 54.16 result marks her fastest in the past 2 years.

A pair of Canadians Kayla Sanchez and Maggie MacNeil were right in the mix for silver and bronze, respectively hitting times of 54.24 and 54.38.

MEN’S 100 BACK – FINAL

GOLD – Thomas Ceccon (ITA), 53.18

SILVER – Ryosuke Irie (JPN), 53.46

BRONZE – Pieter Coetze (RSA), 53.72

The top trio of men all got under the 54-second threshold with ease in this 100m backstroke, led by 21-year-old Olympic relay medalist Thomas Ceccon,

Ceccon comfortably got to the wall ahead of the field with a mark of 53.18, not terribly off his season-best of 52.99 he established this past January. He owns the Italian national record with the 52.30 he notched at the Olympic Games.

32-year-old veteran Ryosuke Irie landed on yet another podium, creeping in with a time of 53.46, about a half second off of his 52.88 notched at the Japan Swim in April to qualify for next month’s World Championships. That rendered Irie ranked 4th, one slot ahead of Ceccon, in this season’s world rankings.

As a testament to Irie’s longevity, the man still owns the overall Mare Nostrum record in this event with the 53.08 he produced over a decade ago.

As for Coetze, at 17 he represented South Africa’s youngest swimming Olypian last year in Tokyo. Now an 18-year-old, he has qualified for his first senior World Championships for Budapest and came in with 53.72 here for the bronze. That’s a new season-best for the teen.

WOMEN’S 100 BREAST – FINAL

GOLD – Anna Elendt (GER), 1:06.07

SILVER – Reona Aoki (JPN), 1:06.43

BRONZE – Sophie Hansson (SWE), 1:06.60

As mentioned above, Elendt of both Germany and the University of Texas fired on all cylinders this morning, registering a super quick prelims time of 1:05.82 in this women’s 100m breast.

The 20-year-old toned it down a tad tonight, although she still wound up on top with a mark of 1:06.07.

Japan’s Reona Aoki, who currently ranks #1 in the world in this event, settled for silver in 1:06.43, while Sophie Hansson of Sweden rounded out the top 3 in 1:06.60.

MEN’S 50 FREE – FINAL

GOLD – Bruno Fratus (BRA), 21.78

SILVER – Ben Proud (GBR), 21.89

BRONZE – Michael Andrew (USA), 22.06

Although last week was the lightning round skins format of the stroke 50’s, the winner there in Monaco, Bruno Fratus of Brazil, collected another gold here.

Punching a time of 21.78, Fratus was slightly off his final mark of 21.49 from Monaco but was still speedy enough to hold off British national record holder Ben Proud.

Proud produced 21.89 for silver while Andrew secured his 2nd medal of the night with a 22.06 for bronze.

Andrew has been as fast as 21.45 this season, which slotted him as the #2 swimmer in the world this season behind teammate Caeleb Dressel. Fratus’ swim from Monaco inserted him as the 3rd fastest performer while Proud remains 10th with his 21.72 time from the Edinburgh International meet.

WOMEN’S 200 BACK – FINAL

SILVER – Eszter Szab0 (HUN), 2:09.62

In the process, Rathwell became Canada’s 4th fastest 17-year-old in history.

Eszter Szabo was a fingernail too late, but still secured silver in 2:09,62, the only other time of the field under 2:11. Szabo’s result here also represents a personal best, slicing .10 off of the 2:09.72 she collected at the 2021 European Championships.

Israeli swimmer Aviv Barzelay was tonight’s bronze medalist in 2:11.68.

MEN’S 200 BREAST – FINAL

SILVER – Yu Hanaguruma (JPN), 2:10.79

BRONZE – Ryuya Mura (JPN), 2:11.86

Arno Kamminga of the Netherlands nabbed the men’s 200m breast victory here in a time much quicker than Monaco.

Just days ago the 26-year-old national record holder put up a time of 2:10.91 at the first stop while he was 2:08.65 here to beat out a pair of Japanese swimmers.

Racing on the Mare Nostrum Tour for the first time in 3 years, the Japanese squad brought many members who will be representing the nation next month in Budapest. Two of those swimmers are Yu Hanaguruma and Ryuya Mura, who finished with the silver and bronze, respectively here.

Hanaguruma touched in 2:10.79 while Mura posted 2:11.86 behind him. As a reminder, Hanaguruma notched a time of 2:07.99 at the Japan Swim to qualify for Worlds, becoming Japan’s 7th fastest 200m breast performer in the process.

Japan’s Kina Hayashi snagged silver in 2:07.27 while American Emma Sticklen of the University of Texas nabbed bronze in 2:08.41.

For Hayashi, she represents Japan’s 3rd faster performer of all time via her 2:06.41 title-winning effort at the Japan International Trials this past April.
