A few words about the 5th arrondissement

The Fifth arrondissement of Paris (le cinquième arrondissement) is situated on the left bank of River Seine. It often bears the name “Quartier Latin” (Latin Quarter).

Why part of the 5th arrondissement is called Latin Quarter?

The Latin Quarter takes its name from the Middle Ages when Latin was the language of learning at the Sorbonne.

It is considered Paris’ oldest district, along with Île de la Cité.

Indeed, remains from the Roman era are still visible today. Check out for:

the Gallo-Roman baths of Cluny

the remains of the Roman Forum (to discover in the stairs leading to an underground carpark!), and more dramatically,

the Arena of Lutetia

The Latin Quarter is a district centred around the Sorbonne. It is home to many universities, colleges, and prestigious high schools. The district has a reputation for being a young lively atmosphere.

It is also remembered as being a major site for the events of May 1968. The student revolt led to a political, social, and cultural protest with barricades set up. And torn-up paving stones used as missiles!

The 5th arrondissement: facts and figures

The 5th arrondissement of Paris covers an area of 2.541 km2 with a population of 60,800 (2011). The district is overlooked by the dome of the Panthéon. The monument sits at the top of an elevated mount called Montagne Sainte-Geneviève (alt. 61 m above sea level).

The 5th arrt. includes some famous Parisian monuments such as the Panthéon, the Arab World Institute, and the National Museum of Natural History (including the Grand Gallery of Evolution).

The Latin Quarter is home to prestigious and historic universities and colleges: the Sorbonne university, the Jussieu university campus, Lycée Henri IV and the medieval Clovis Tower, Ecole Nationale Supérieure…

Two large public parks border the 5th arrt.: the Luxembourg Garden to the West and the Jardin des Plantes to the East. The latter includes the Ménagerie (France’s oldest public zoo).

A number of historic streets criss-cross the district. For example, Rue Saint-Jacques, Paris’ oldest street. Rue Mouffetard boasts a colourful and lively market.

Where to stay in the 5th arrondissement?

Hotels in Paris vary from stunning luxurious places like the Ritz and the Meurice to much simpler hotels in charming older parts of the city. However, due to its central location, you will find the level of prices of all types of accommodation quite high in the 5th arrt. Depending on your budget, might want to find cheaper accommodation further away from the hyper centre of Paris!

Shopping recommendation in the 5th arrt.

The 5th arrondissement isn’t maybe the most exciting shopping district in Paris.

That said, you can expect to see a number of bookstores as it’s an area full of students, and you’ll also find lots of typical cafés.

Here are a few addresses I spotted/visited when strolling in ‘le Quartier Latin’:

👉 If you’re interested in old books and prints, check out the bouquinistes on the banks of the River Seine.

👉 Don’t miss the picturesque and colourful market of Rue Mouffetard. The lively street happens to be a shopping one with great food stores (bakery, butcher, caterer…)

👉 Boulevard Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Germain are the busiest streets of the 5th arrondissement with many cafés, restaurants and shops.

☕️ You’ve probably heard of Shakespeare & Co, Paris’ oldest bookstore. Did you know the vintage institution opened its own coffee shop? Sit outside and enjoy the view of the towers of Notre-Dame Cathedral (37 Rue de la Bûcherie).

🥖 According to the 2019 competition for the Paris’ best baguette, the best boulangerie is in the 5th arrondissement called Paris & Co Écoles, 4 bis rue des Écoles.
