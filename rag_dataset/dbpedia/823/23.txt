DESCRIPTION:

(from Bravo's web site) Bravo's "Battle of the Network Reality Stars" is the single biggest gathering of reality stars in a competition-based show, encompassing 16 different series from eight networks. The six episode series originating from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California kicks off on Wednesday, August 17 at 9:00 p.m. ET/PT with a 90-minute premiere episode, followed by five one-hour episodes. Nearly 30 years after its 1976 debut, Bravo will resurrect the wildly popular concept behind the original "Battle of the Network Stars," which was hosted by sports broadcasting legend Howard Cosell and featured notable competitors such as Billy Crystal, Farrah Fawcett, David Letterman, and Heather Locklear. Just as Katherine Bach of Daisy Duke fame got dunked repeatedly in the original battle, you'll see Coral Smith from "The Real World" get dunked in the new series. The updated format of the much-loved series is complete with teams of sweat suit and Speedo-clad reality stars that will partake in physical and aggressively competitive challenges reminiscent of the original program. TV's most cherished and loathed reality stars will compete in a joust, navigate a kayak race, and battle it out in the famed tug-of-war, among other challenges. In a nod to today's reality shows, twists and turns along the way force team members to vote each other off, create alliances, and generate unending drama and tears.
