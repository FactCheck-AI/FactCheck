Parish History[edit | edit source]

HULL, or Kingston-upon-Hull, a sea-port, borough, and county of itself, situated on the borders of the East Riding of York, 39 miles SE from York, and 170 N from London; comprising the parishes of St. Mary, the Holy Trinity, Drypool, and Sculcoates, the extra-parochial district of Garrison-Side, and part of the parish of Sutton. The Trinity House was built in 1457, and rebuilt in 1753. The Charter-house was founded in the year 1384.[1]

Holy Trinity is an ancient and spacious cruciform structure, with a lofty and very beautiful tower rising from the intersection, and supported on piers and arches of elegant proportions: the east end is in the decorated English style, and the transepts are fine specimens of the earliest period of that style; the window in the south transept is filled with tracery, and enriched with mouldings of curious character. The edifice was re-opened, after judicious restoration, in December, 1845.[2]
