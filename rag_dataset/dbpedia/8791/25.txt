Background

Slovakia traces its roots to the 9th century state of Great Moravia, followed soon after by the Hungarian Kingdom and, in 1859, the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After World War I, the Empire dissolved, and the Slovaks joined the Czechs to form Czechoslovakia. In 1993, Czechoslovakia underwent a nonviolent "velvet divorce" into its two national components, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.
