NANTERRE, France — From the outside lane, American swimmer Torri Huske pulled off an absolute stunner to win silver in the women’s 100-meter freestyle final Wednesday night at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, the 30-year-old world record holder, hit the wall for gold with a time of 52.16, while Huske won silver with a 52.29 and Siobhan Bernadette Haughey of Hong Kong earned bronze with a 52.33 at Paris La Défense Arena.

This is the second individual medal of the Paris Games for Huske following Sunday’s women’s 100-meter butterfly final, where Huske won her first Olympic gold.

The women’s 100 free final featured two of the fastest 100 freestylers of all time: Sjöström, who set the world record July 22, 2017 in Budapest, Hungary, and Hong Kong’s Haughey, who posted the third-fastest 100 free time ever last year. In a tight finish, all eight swimmers were separated by a fraction of a second.
