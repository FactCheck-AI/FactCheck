The Nootbaar Fellows Program at Pepperdine Caruso Law brings together a community of distinguished scholars in the law and religion field. Through regular workshops and conferences, Nootbaar fellows share innovative research and academic projects with the ultimate goal of deepening knowledge and wisdom in the field of law and religion. Annually, we hold a Nootbaar Fellows Conference here in Malibu. This conference is scheduled to expand over the next three academic years thanks to a generous donation pledge from Founders First.
