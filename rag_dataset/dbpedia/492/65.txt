Planet D Nonet

Tribute to Buddy Johnson

On this live recording, Planet D Nonet play many of my favorite Buddy Johnson tunes. So put on this CD, sit back and hear the music of one of Rhythm and Blues greatest composers unfold into what became Rock and Roll a decade later. It's a fun and enjoyable trip!

'Paxton Spangler Septet

This recording by the Paxton/Spangler septet lives up to its name, Ugqozi, which translates from isiZulu as "inspiration." This inspiration is layered and can be felt and understood on various levels. - Salim Washington, 2022
