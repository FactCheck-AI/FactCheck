a. What was the population for this survey?

b. What was the sample for this survey?

c. Why was a sample used in this situation? Explain.

The first time that Arnold ran for mayor in a small town, he received 5% of the votes. This year, when Arnold ran for mayor again, he received 4 times as many votes as he did when ran the first time. There were 360 total votes in each election. How many votes did Arnold receive this year

In 2003, the state of California conducted its first recall election. Over one hundred candidates vied to replace Gray Davis as Governor, with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger winning 49% of the votes cast. In the days before the election, newspapers had published accusations of inappropriate treatment of women by Schwarzenegger, so some suspected that his support from women would be weaker than his support from men. Before the polls closed, pundits tried to predict the election results by using "exit polls," asking people as they left the voting booth who they voted for. In one such poll that year, CNN interviewed 2023 men and 2191 women. A total of 991 men and 942 women said they voted for Arnold. The research question being investigated in this study is whether there is convincing evidence that male voters in 2003 were more likely to say they voted for Arnold than female voters in 2003.

A recent survey asked San Diego residents the following question: "If you had been aware that before Schwarzenegger ran for Governor, he had fathered a child outside of his marriage, would you still have voted for him?" Out of the 136 males surveyed who had voted for Schwarzenegger at least once, 78 said they would still vote for him. And out of the 128 females, 48 said they would. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the proportions of male and female SD residents who would have voted for Schwarzenegger even if they knew that he had fathered a child outside of his marriage.
