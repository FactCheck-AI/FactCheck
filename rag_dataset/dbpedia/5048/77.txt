In countries like the US, France, and Germany, the following terms are commonly used to describe the rule of the road for these countries:

Right-hand traffic (RHT) - Traffic position

Keep to the right - Traffic position

Drive on the right - Traffic position

Left-hand drive (LHD) - Driver position

In countries like the UK, Japan, India, and Australia, the following terms are commonly used to describe the rule of the road for these countries:

Left-hand traffic (LHT) - Traffic position

Keep to the left - Traffic position

Drive on the left - Traffic position

Right-hand drive (RHD) - Driver position

The Waze Wiki should use the phrases right-hand traffic and left-hand traffic. Since the left-hand drive and right-hand drive phrases use a direction term that is opposite of the other terms and it is uniquely describing the position of the driver, it is better not to include that phrase when describing the rule of the road. Excluding its use will help reduce the ambiguity possible if a reader mistakes the left-hand drive or right-hand drive is describing the side of the road on which you drive.
