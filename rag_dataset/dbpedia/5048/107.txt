On multi-lane streets, roads and highways, section 316.081(3), Florida Statutes, requires that drivers drive in the right-hand lanes to prevent impeding the flow of traffic resulting in dangerous driving situations.

DRIVE IN THE RIGHT LANE

AND PASS ON THE LEFT.

Drivers must not continue to drive a vehicle in the far left lane when being overtaken by a faster moving vehicle, unless the driver is preparing for a left-hand turn at an intersection.

Drivers failing to move from the far left lane will receive a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a moving violation.

Safety Reminders

When preparing to move into the right lane, you must indicate your intention to change lanes by using your vehicleâ€™s right turn signal.

While in the far right lane, watch for vehicles entering the highway. Adjust your speed or move over so that they may safely enter the highway.
