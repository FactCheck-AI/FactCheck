NATIONALLY RANKED TEAMS

Earlier this week, the NCAA released their standings for Division III Men's Hockey. The Saints (17-6-3) are currently the #21 ranked team in the nation with the Auggies (15-9-2) two spots below them at the #23 spot.

SAINTS LAST TIME OUT

The St. Scholastica men's hockey team hosted the Semifinals game last Sunday night against St. Olaf College. The Saints would score two in the first and another in the second, but the Oles would add two of their own in the second period as well. Although, it would be the Saints who would hold their one-goal lead all the way until the last remaining seconds and knock off the 2022 MIAC Playoff champions, 3-2.

UPCOMING MATCHUP

The Saints will see Augsburg University in the finals, the Auggies advanced with a 3-1 semifinal win over Saint John's University last weekend. These two teams saw each other last month, CSS took five of six standings points in the regular season series on February 17-18, earning a shootout victory on Friday night and a regulation win on Saturday.

After the St. Olaf victory, Duluth New Tribune's Brandon Veale spoke with Head Coach Dave Williams and here is what he said about his upcoming opponents, "our speed will help us against them. They're really heavy on their sticks and good in 50/50 battles, but I think we have the advantage in transition and top-end speed. It's going to be a battle. They're going to have a chip on their shoulder after last weekend, so we're ready for a good test here".
