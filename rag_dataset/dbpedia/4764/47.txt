An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is an 8-digit code that uniquely identifies a serial or other continuing resource (periodical, magazine, journal, newspaper, annual, monographic series, website or database). Canadian publishers are not obligated to obtain ISSNs, but Government of Canada publishers are required to use them. ISSN Canada provides ISSNs for free.
