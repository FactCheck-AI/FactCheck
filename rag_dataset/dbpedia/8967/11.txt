A message from Al-Hariri to Sfeir

The Maronite Patriarch, cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir celebrated the holy mass yesterday in Bkerkeh. In his preachement, Sfeir said that freedom was the most precious value God gave to man. Without freedom, there is no responsibility, no judgment, no punishment, and no dignity. He added that religious freedom was very important. Religious groups must not be prohibited from broadcasting their doctrines, but they should do it in a responsible way, not by force. Authorities must protect the civil rights, and provide the enforcement of laws. These are the rules, he ended, that are implemented in most civilized countries.

After the Holy mass, crowds of faithful people gathered in the big square of the Patriarch palace in Bkerki. They expressed their displeasure of the government decision to stop "Voice of Charity" and "Tele Lumiere" from broadcasting.

A member of the board of directors of "Tele Lumiere", Antoine Saad, then spoke on behalf of the crowds saying it was crime against humanity to cease the church from communicating with its audience."Voice of charity and Tele Lumiere are means that never threatened the national security but worked for peace, freedom and love".

We wouldn't let that happen, he said, and we're strong. Everybody should say no.

Sfeir then made of speech about freedom and the means of communication, in which he made it clear that freedom was essential, and that media should tell nothing but the truth. He wanted a strong state that originated from a strong people, and said he was with each voice working for peace and freedom, in Lebanon and the region, and asked God, in this rosary Sunday, to inspire everyone on good thoughts and deeds.

On the other hand, the general secretary of the Maronite League, Attorney Nehmtallah Abi Nasr, considered that the authority was unable to close whorehouses, but couldn't hear the "Voice of Charity".

For this reason, this government won't last long , He also estimated that democracy must remain , because there is no freedom of communication without democracy and vice versa.

Sfeir also received two members of the christian. Islamic dialogue committee, Mr Mohammad Assammak and Mr Hareth Chrab. Mr Assammak carried a message from president Al-Hariri to the Maronite patriarch. According to Assammak, the meeting was fruitful, and will have consequences later on.
