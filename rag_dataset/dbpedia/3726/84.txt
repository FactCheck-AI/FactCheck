Zwolle and Almere City square off against each other in the Eredivisie round 22 in what is expected to be a close encounter. Zwolle have been in a fine form of late, with the team beating both Vitesse and Sparta, while sharing the spoils with Go Ahead Eagles and it is no suprise the bookies see them as favourites to beat Almere on home soil. Even though Bram van Polen is banned for the match due to the accumulation of yellow cards, home win should be considered.

The visitors, on the other hand, did well to hold AZ Alkmaar to a goalless draw in their last league match. Almere City have collected 11 points in total on the road this term and, taking everything into account, the share of spoils is on the horizon. There are no fresh injury concerns in the visiting team.
