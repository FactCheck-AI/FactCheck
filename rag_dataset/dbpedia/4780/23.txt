They were both up for the Critic's Choice award and Adele came out on top , but since then Duffy has hit No.1 whereas Adele failed. They both seemed to have gone to the Amy Winehouse school of singing and aren't really original but who do you prefer out of these two , and did Adele deserve that award over Duffy?

I personally prefer Duffy as her song is a little edgier and I can't help but feeling Adele's time at the BRIT school helped her win that award. I also feel like we're being forced to think that we should all love her as she is really original and credible and because of her "breathtaking" voice.

That's just my opinion though , what about you?
