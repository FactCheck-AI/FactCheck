Bob Dylan can't sing either. Doesn't stop him from being one of the greatest artists of all-time.

NB: I am NOT equating Duffy with Bob Dylan! I don't like her music at all, but am sick of all this 'they can't sing, therefore they're useless' criticism. The X-Factor has poisoned peoples minds; they can't look past voices.

She can sing but her voice is extremely shrill and she's built her career on her songs IMO. I don't think the majority of her sales have come from people liking her voice, more to do with people liking her songs.

Good for her to write and record some great songs but it means there is a pressure to keep it up because I can't see people sticking with her if the songs are bad or average.

She used to be able to sing a lot better. Her voice on the album is far better than on more recent recordings like Rain On Your Parade and any live stuff she does. Her voice is a lot thinner and squeakier now and it definitely grates!

Well there's a simple solution for the aurally challenged who don't like Duffy ....... don't listen to her.

Then the rest of us millions who enjoy Duffy's raw and soulful talent can do so, without having to read the same old regurgitated comments from folk who really would be better off listening to that other Welsh lass Katherine Jenkins.

It really is shocking that people like singers who can actually sing. :eek: What a strange concept.

Yea but the general consensus (I'm not saying just this thread but others aswell) is that if you can't sing then you're 100% crap in every way. I'm no major Duffy fan but in my opinion she is a better all round artist than alot the her peers that have better voices technically. Ian Curtis couldn't sing, Morrissey couldn't sing, didn't stop them from being among the most influential musicians. Its not all about the voice.

Nothing personal Duffy but your horrid voice really grates.Why do you sing through your nose which makes you sound like Pinky and Perky.The Pepsi advert is the limit and I've never heard anyone sing so bad.It does not sound natural and it's a case of the Emperor wearing no clothes since no one wants to speak out.Amy Whinehouse is another culprit who's not far behind.Takesomesinging lessons.

I saw a clip of Amy Winehouse singing when she was younger and she was pretty outstanding.

So I'd say that Amy CAN sing or at least has the capability to.

But I have seen the media being overly kind to her and singing her praises when she hasn't been good, for example in a performance on the Brits a year or two ago.

I know that she's been better than that but the media were overrating her performances around that time.

I am a fan of Duffy, but I have to admitt her voice is a little on the strange side.

I love her songs, and I think they are much better recorded than live, I think Duffy tries to put too much emphasis on her voice which can make it sound very strange and sometimes very off.

I also have to agree with the poster who mentioned she is over-rated. She is very much so, I couldn't believe the amount of awards she was racking up at the Brits. All that said though I do love her album Rockferry...my favourite song from her has to be rain on your parade. But for me, she is nothing massive.
