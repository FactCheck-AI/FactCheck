Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela would have been 82 years old today.

Born on the 26th of September, 1936, in the Eastern Cape, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela was a fierce anti-apartheid activist and she was also the former wife of Nelson Mandela. During Nelson Mandela’s incarceration, she campaigned tirelessly for his release and for the rights of black South Africans. Her life has been captured on television, in film and even opera - and she remains a powerful icon of the anti-apartheid liberation struggle. When she died in 2018, the slogan “Mama didn’t die, she multiplied” became widely popular, acknowledging her legacy which lives on in the hearts of her fellow country-folk and southern Africans in general.

Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela died on the 2nd of April, 2018, in South Africa. Her family said she had suffered from a long illness and died peacefully. May her soul continue to rest in perfect peace.
