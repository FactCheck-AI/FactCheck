Ms Madikizela-Mandela passed away on 2 April 2018.

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela (1936 - 2018) was born on 26 September 1936 in Bizana, Pondoland. Madikizela-Mandela attended high school at Shawbury before completing a social work diploma at the Jan Hofmeyer School in Johannesburg. This was followed by a BA with an International Relations major at the University of the Witwatersrand.

While working as the first black medical social worker at Baragwanath Hospital, exposed to the abject poverty under which most people were forced to live, she started to become politicised.

She was first detained in 1958 for her role in the anti-pass campaign, and in the same year married the late former President Nelson Mandela.

At the time, she served on the national executive of the ANC Women’s League, and chaired the Orlando West branch of the ANC.

Her first banning order in 1962 restricted her to Soweto.

Five years later, she was arrested in Cape Town on a visit to her husband. She spent one month in the Johannesburg prison known as the Fort

In 1969, Winnie became one of the first detainees under Section 6 of the notorious Terrorism Act.

She was kept in solitary confinement for 18 months in the condemned cell at Pretoria Central before being charged — and eventually found not guilty — under the Suppression of Communism Act.

Her banning order expired in 1975, and was reimposed in December 1976.

In 1976, following her activities during the uprising by school children protesting the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction, Madikizela-Mandela was detained for six months at the Fort.

In May 1977, she was banished to Brandfort in the Free State.

Here her house was bombed twice and in 1985 she was arrested for defying her restriction order and returning to Johannesburg.

In 1985, Madikizela Mandela won the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, along with fellow activists Allan Boesak and Beyers Naudé, for their human rights work in South Africa.[28] She received a Candace Award for Distinguished Service from the National Coalition of 100 Black Women in 1988. In January 2018, the University Council and University Senate of Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda, approved the award of an honorary Doctor of Laws (LLD) degree to Winnie Nomzamo Madikizela-Mandela, in recognition of her fight against apartheid in South Africa.

She was elected as the President of the ANC’s Women’s League in 1993, was made Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science and Technology in the 1994 unity government and was elected to the ANC National Executive Committee at the Polokwane Conference in 2007. She served as a Member of Parliament from 1994 to 2003 and 2009 to 2018.

Madikizela-Mandela is survived by her two daughters, Zindziswa Mandela-Hlongwane and Zenani Mandela
