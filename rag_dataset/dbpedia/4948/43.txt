Scott Barrett has been named the new All Blacks captain, leading a 32-member squad that includes five uncapped players, announced today ahead of the 2024 Steinlager Ultra Low Carb Series.

Selected by All Blacks Head Coach Scott Robertson and his assistants Scott Hansen, Jason Holland, Leon MacDonald, and Jason Ryan, the team will play two Tests against England in Dunedin and Auckland, and one against Fiji in San Diego.

The 32-strong Steinlager Ultra Low Carb Series squad is as follows: (age, Super Rugby club, province, Test caps).

The following players were not considered due to injury: Sam Cane, Will Jordan, Samisoni Taukei’aho, Cam Roigard.

Scott Barrett, 30, will become the 81st man to captain the All Blacks in a Test if he adds to the 69 Test caps he has earned since his debut against Ireland in 2016. He will be supported by Vice Captains Ardie Savea and Jordie Barrett.

“When you think of the leaders who have gone before you, it’s quite humbling to be asked to captain the All Blacks, so it’s not something I took lightly. It’s a big responsibility, but I have two great leaders beside me in Ardie and Jordie, and I know we’ll have the full backing of the coaches,” Barrett said.

George Bell* (22 / Crusaders / Canterbury)

At 183cm and107kg George Bell is a dynamic young hooker who grew up on a sheep and beef station in Otago. He first played for the Eastern Rugby Football Club in Waikouaiti and later became a boarder at John McGlashan College, where he excelled as an age-grade cricketer. A New Zealand U20 representative and Crusaders Academy member in 2022, Bell made his DHL Super Rugby Pacific debut for the Crusaders against the Western Force before he had played his first Bunnings Warehouse NPC match for Canterbury. In 2022 he was named the New Zealand Rugby Almanack Most Promising Player of the Year after standing out for Canterbury.

Billy Proctor* (25 / Hurricanes / Wellington)

Wellington born Billy Proctor’s talents were identified shortly after he left St Patrick’s College when he signed a five-year contract with the Hurricanes in 2019 and the investment has paid off. Proctor has become a mainstay of the Hurricanes backline in Super Rugby since his debut in 2019. Rugby talent and success run in the Proctor family, with his older brother Matt becoming All Black #1177 in 2018. Their father Phil was a New Zealand junior representative and played tighthead prop for Wellington. In 2020, Billy made his Māori All Blacks debut against Moana Pasifika in Hamilton.

Cortez Ratima* (23 / Chiefs / Waikato)

King Country-born halfback Cortez Ratima has been in irresistible form for the Chiefs in DHL Super Rugby Pacific in 2024. He was raised on a farm in Piopio before briefly attending New Plymouth Boys’ High School, then Hamilton Boys High School. Two years out of school he was playing in the Bunnings Warehouse NPC for Waikato, and in 2022 he made his Chiefs debut and was recognised with selection in the All Blacks XV squad for their Northern Tour.

Wallace Sititi* (21 / Chiefs / North Harbour)

Wallce Sititi plays his rugby in the same position as his father, former Manu Samoa and Hurricanes loose forward Semo, and his powerful play was a feature for the Chiefs during DHL Super Rugby Pacific. At 21 years old, Wallace is the youngest player named in the 2024 Steinlager Ultra Low Carb Series All Blacks squad. Wallace Sititi was deputy head boy at De La Salle College and captain of the first XV and captained the Blues U20 side in 2022, before being selected in the New Zealand U20 squad. He made his Bunnings Warehouse NPC debuted for North Harbour the same year, and joined the Chiefs wider training squad in 2023.

Pasilio Tosi* (25 / Hurricanes / Bay of Plenty)

Pasilio Tosi’s transformation from a loose forward to a prop has been a sensational success story. In 2018 Tosi spent two years playing for the Southland Stags, mostly as a No.8 before heading north to Bay of Plenty for the 2021 Bunnings Warehouse NPC season. He caught the eye of the Hurricanes who offered him his first Super Rugby contract in 2022. Born and raised in Levin, north of Wellington, Tosi attended Horowhenua College before spending three years in the Rotorua Boys’ High School first XV.
