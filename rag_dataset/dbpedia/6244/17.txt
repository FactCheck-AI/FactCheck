WSBR is now Live365! They have been off the air for a bit, but they are back and hope to be better than ever. You can listen to their broadcast 24/7 at wsbr.saratogabridges.org. The WSBR crew poured through their music collections and picked out some sweet tracks for your listening pleasure. In addition to a nice mix of music, this program includes a trivia contest they did, as well as the first installment of their “Survivor” series.
