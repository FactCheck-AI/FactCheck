Iga Swiatek, seeking a fourth French Open title in five years, plays Italian Jasmine Paolini in the final at Roland Garros, live on NBC Sports and Peacock on Saturday at 9 a.m. ET.

Top-ranked Swiatek of Poland lost just one set en route to the final, including a 6-2, 6-4 sweep of No. 3 seed Coco Gauff in the semifinals.

Swiatek can become the first woman to win three consecutive French Opens since Justine Henin from 2005-07.

She also bids to become the fourth and youngest woman in the professional era (since 1968) to win four French Open singles titles.

The others were Chris Evert (seven titles), Steffi Graf (six) and Henin (four).

Swiatek can also become the first woman to win a fifth Grand Slam singles title since Maria Sharapova won her last at the 2014 French Open. Venus Williams, who won seven titles from 2000 to 2008, is the lone active woman with more than four Slams.

Paolini, ranked 15th in the world, needed three consecutive three-set wins to reach the semifinals, where she dispatched 17-year-old Russian Mirra Andreeva 6-3, 6-1.

The 28-year-old Italian had never been past the second round of a major before 2024.

She can become the oldest woman to win a Slam since German Angelique Kerber at 2018 Wimbledon and the oldest woman to win her first Slam since the last Italian woman to win a Slam — Flavia Pennetta at the 2015 U.S. Open at age 33.
