Get Out of My Room (1985)

** (out of 4)

Fair mockumentary from Cheech Marin has him directing and co-starring with Tommy Chong as they play themselves being followed by a "reporter" doing a story on their new album. We see interviews with them, interviews with fans and there's also four music videos. GET OUT OF MY ROOM really isn't a good or entertaining picture and I think for the most part it's mainly going to appeal to C&C fans who have to see everything the duo did. With that said, it's certainly far from a "bad" movie but at the same time the duo simply has so many better pictures to watch over this one. I think the highlight of the film is the video for "Born in East L.A.," which is obviously a take off on Bruce Springsteen's "Born in the U.S.A.." I think fans of C&C as well as Springsteen will get a kick out of the video as it spoofs the city and Marin growing up there. The weakest aspect of the film are actually the fake interviews with Cheech and Chong as they simply aren't that funny and in fact they're not nearly as entertaining as some of the questions aimed at the fans.
