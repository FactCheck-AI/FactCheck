POSE WITH A

GIANT OCTOPUS SCULPTURE

AT THE

OCULUS IN NYC

UNTAPPED NEW YORK

ISSUE #1278

WEDNESDAY, JULY 24, 2024

Eight welcoming arms…make that tentacles…beckon passersby to engage with a brand new interactive art installation at the World Trade Center. Titled “The Arms of Friendship,” this piece by artists Gille and Marc is one of the largest octopus sculptures in the world! Placed outside the Oculus World Trade Center on the South Oculus Plaza, the playful sculpture embodies the artist couple’s mission of connecting people and wildlife.

A giant octopus isn’t the only colossal creature Gillie and Marc rendered in bronze for this artwork. Cradled in the octopus’ tentacles sit a handful of the world’s most endangered animals including a rhino, zebra, elephant, hippo, and more. You can also spot two of Gillie and Marc’s signature characters, Rabbitwoman and Dogman.

The sculpture spans 36 feet and weighs a hefty 7 tons. Visitors are invited to sit on the massive tentacles, among the animals, and get an up-close look. By fostering this closeness between people and the realistic and super-detailed animal figures, the artists hope to inspire a connection and spread awareness of the need for wildlife conservation.

In addition to “The Arms of Friendship,” two signature interactive sculptures, “The Wild Table of Love” and “The Hippo Was Hungry To Try New Things With Rabbitwoman” are also on display outside the Oculus. Here again, humans are invited to interact with the animals. Have a seat at the table and dine among the endangered species!

The three bronze sculptures will be on view through July 31st, 2025. You can also check out Gille and Marc’s “The Wild Couch Party” in the Financial District!

A DAY TRIP

TO

GOVERNOR’S ISLAND

ISSUE # 1277

JUDITH BERDY

RANYEE LEE & HAYOON JAY LEE

I have been reading all about the new attractions on Governor’s Island. Who can resist a day trip off the island for $2.90 (senior fare)?

My friends Ranyee and Hayoon joined me at the Wall Street Pier. The NY Ferry lands at the Yankee Dock on Governor’s Island. It’s slightly confusing as the few times I have been there, Soisson’s Landing was used.

There are two ferry operators on weekends, the NYC Ferry from Wall Street, and the Governor’s Island Ferry from the Battery Marine Building ($5 for adults, free for seniors).

Transportation on the island includes bikes, pedal bikes, and walking. There seems to be a large golf cart for those with disabilities. Many distances are long and some are on sunny hills. The area around the federal landmark, Fort Jay, and Nolan Park near Fort Jay have lots of shaded areas.

One issue is the scarce availability of bathrooms, similar to our island. There are a few tucked away from the active areas. With thousands of visitors, I could only locate five sites on the map. Most are portable trailer units, and though large, they become uncomfortably hot in this weather.

There is a large food court and dining area on Liggitt Terrace. All kind of food offerings are there and plenty of seating.

OTHER OF PEARL

by Jenny Kendler

Oth­er of Pearl is pre­sent­ed in part­ner­ship by Gov­er­nors Island Arts and NRDC (Nat­ur­al Resources Defense Coun­cil).

In Oth­er of Pearl, Jen­ny Kendler (b. 1980, New York, NY) tells the sto­ry of the extrac­tive his­to­ries that form the ori­gin sto­ries of the cli­mate and envi­ron­men­tal cri­sis, while con­sid­er­ing the oys­ter and whale as cen­tral play­ers in an eco­log­i­cal entan­gle­ment between human and non­hu­man beings, water­ways, and flows of cap­i­tal.

Focus­ing on our rela­tion­ships with these two very dif­fer­ent beings, Kendler illu­mi­nates the ways in which cap­i­tal­ist sys­tems are often found­ed upon the bod­ies of oth­ers. The artist con­fronts con­tem­po­rary envi­ron­men­tal issues — cli­mate change, ocean noise, chem­i­cal pol­lu­tion, bio­di­ver­si­ty loss, and sea lev­el rise — while point­ing towards the cul­tur­al struc­tures that have allowed these cat­a­stro­phes to occur.

Oth­er of Pearl, Kendler’s first solo exhi­bi­tion in New York City, trans­forms the mag­a­zine of Fort Jay into a space for slow explo­ration. Here you will encounter sev­en inti­mate and del­i­cate works, includ­ing a hand­blown glass instru­ment where you can sing in the voice of a whale and pearl sculp­tures grown inside oys­ters. At the con­clu­sion of the exhi­bi­tion, the pearl sculp­tures will be auc­tioned to raise funds to help cre­ate a new oys­ter reef — redis­trib­ut­ing resources in a ges­ture of eco­log­i­cal restora­tion — in part­ner­ship with the Bil­lion Oys­ter Project.

By offer­ing this propo­si­tion of a more inti­mate, and bod­i­ly rela­tion­ship with the nat­ur­al world, Oth­er of Pearl pro­pos­es a new way to envi­sion who mat­ters and who we build the future for, invit­ing us to imag­ine a restored prac­tice of reci­procity between human and non-humans.

Jen­ny Kendler is an inter­dis­ci­pli­nary artist, envi­ron­men­tal activist, nat­u­ral­ist, and wild for­ager whose work has been exhib­it­ed nation­al­ly and inter­na­tion­al­ly at muse­ums, bien­ni­als, pub­lic spaces, and nat­ur­al areas. For the past two decades, Kendler’s work has focused on cli­mate change and bio­di­ver­si­ty loss. Her prac­tice seeks to decen­ter the human and re-enchant our rela­tion­ship with the nat­ur­al world. She is a found­ing mem­ber of Artists Com­mit, which seeks to raise cli­mate con­scious­ness in the art­world, and Artist-in-Res­i­dence at NRDC.

OTHER OF PEAR IS LOCATED UNDER FORT JAY, A PERFECT COOL DARK LOCATION TO APPRECIATE THE PEARLS AND OYSTERS.

MEDITATIONS ON MEDICATION is an exhibition made up entirely of prescription bottles(empty). Inside one of the homes on Colonels Row a vast array of bottles decorated the building

If you plan on visiting, bring some empties.

The amber glow of the bottles shines thru the curtain

Walking back to the ferry, we came upon the Synagogue. Relatively intact with a Stars of David, a menorah and signboard.

After 11,000 steps, we found our way back to Yankee Pier for the rides home.

INSIDE THE

WASHINGTON SQUARE ARCH

ISSUE # 1276

UNTAPPED NEW YORK

One of New York City’s most elusive places is the inside of the Washington Square Park arch, which has been long closed off to the public. Until a few years ago, the interior was too unstable for public access. But a video from the Unforgotten film series, which premiered first on Untapped New York in 2022, gives you a first-hand look inside. The episode, titled “How History, Community, and Art Can Define an Iconic New York City Monument,” features Sheryl Woodruff, Deputy Director of the Washington Square Park Conservancy; Nicholas Baume, Artistic & Executive Director at Public Art Fund; Karen Karbiener, Professor in the English department at New York University; and Michelle Young, the founder of Untapped New york. The video depicts everything from dance and music performances in the park to a public art installation and shots of the Arch’s interior.

The Unforgotten Films is now partnering with the New York Landmark Conservancy to highlight forgotten New York sites and their histories. For the next few months, the Conservancy will highlight a new Unforgotten film on social media. Each film will focus on a different location, from the abandoned hospital on Ellis Island to Green-Wood Cemetery. We’ll be following along, so stay tuned!

Untapped New York Insiders got to attend a live virtual screening of the Unforgotten film with creator Aaron Asis. You can watch a recording of this event in the Insiders on-demand archive, along with over 250+ other past virtual experiences! Become an Insider today to gain free access to the video archive and upcoming live in-person and virtual events.

The episode captures the diversity and the “greater city” within the park through interviews and B-roll scenes of daily life. The episode gives viewers a bit of a history lesson as well; the park was built atop a potter’s field with approximately 20,000 people buried by 1825. Washington Square Park was opened two years later as a military parade ground, which people used to congregate. The Arch was one of the final additions to the park after the fountain in the 1850s. The Arch has a spiral staircase inside that leads to the roof, giving the rare viewer a 360-degree look at Manhattan (access inside and atop was provided through a special joint event between Untapped New York and NYC Parks in 2019 thanks to former Parks Commissioner Mitchell Silver).

In the episode, you will learn about the time Marcel Duchamp and other Dadaists illegally climbed to the top of the Arch and declared it an independent republic. Fast forward to the modern era, and the episode also dives into artist Ai Weiwei‘s 2017 sculpture “Good Fences Make Good Neighbors,” which served as a commentary on the increasing hostility towards immigrants nationwide. Ai integrated his sculpture into the shape of the arch, which the episode suggests reinforced the diversity and openness of people from all walks of life.

“Washington Square Park certainly is a cultural center and folks will rally either around the fountain or around the arch itself.” Sheryl Woodruff, Deputy Director of the Washington Square Park Conservancy, says in the video. “It’s been the site of protests, it’s been the site of incredible cultural activity in a place where you can feel the city’s presence very strongly,” Karen Karbiener of NYU and the Walt Whitman Initiative, continues.

Unforgotten Films is made possible with funds from the Statewide Community Regrants Program, a regrant program of the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature and administered by the Brooklyn Arts Council.

MARJORIE MATTHEWS AWARDS AT COLER

Marking Borscht Belt History

ISSUE # 1275

NEW YORK ALMANACK

Mel Brooks, Sid Caesar & Marking Borscht Belt History

July 12, 2024 by John Conway

Mel Brooks was 14 years old and still known as Melvin Kaminsky when he began working as a busboy in the Catskills at the Butler Lodge in Hurleyville, Sullivan County, hoping to be in the right place at the right time to start a career as an entertainer.

In his 2021 autobiography, All About Me: My Remarkable Life in Show Business, Brooks wrote that whenever he finished his duties as a busboy at the Butler Lodge he would travel to some of the larger hotels nearby to watch their comics perform.

“I loved the Mountains,” he wrote. “The Borscht Belt was so important for my training in comedy. I think it was there that I first learned my craft. The audiences were very tough. They didn’t give it away. When you got a laugh, you really earned it. Those audiences sharpened your ability to survive and sometimes triumph over disastrous performances.”

While there is little doubt that performing in the Mountains at an early age played a major role in the development of Mel Brooks’ career, a relationship he formed while working here proved even more significant.

At one point, his friend and mentor, Don Appell, the social director at the Avon Lodge in Woodridge — and the man who got Mel the job at the Butler Lodge in the first place — introduced him to a young man named Sidney Caesar, who had just graduated high school and was working as a musician at the Avon.

“Six foot two with lush dark blond hair and the shoulders of a lifeguard, ‘Sid’ didn’t look like the usual Jewish boy from Yonkers,” Patrick McGilligan wrote in Funny Man, his 2019 biography of Brooks.

“Younger than Caesar by four years and shorter by six or eight inches, Melvin was instantly smitten by such a physical specimen. ‘Sid was the Apollo of the Mountains, the best looking guy since silent movies,’ Brooks recollected in one interview. ‘He’d stretch himself out on a rock by the lake, and we’d all just look at him.’”

Although they were just casual acquaintances at first, the two would soon form a comedy team of writer and performer that helped make television an instant hit with the American public.

Mel Brooks is one of the most famous entertainers who cut their teeth in the Sullivan County Catskills, but he is just one of hundreds who performed at hundreds of hotels during the heyday of the Borscht Belt. Some of those men—and a few women—went on to become household names, while many others are long forgotten.

Long forgotten too, are many of the hotels that employed those entertainers, and that’s one reason why the ongoing Borscht Belt Historic Marker Project is of such monumental importance in preserving the heritage of the Mountains.

The project — spearheaded locally by photographers Marisa Scheinfeld and Isaac Jeffreys – will dedicate its seventh marker on Sunday, July 21 in Hurleyville, and the stories of Mel Brooks and his brief tenure at the Butler Lodge will likely be in the spotlight.

But Hurleyville was home to many hotels over the years, and although little remains of most of them, they all deserve to be remembered.

From the ill-fated Shindler’s Prairie House to the Majestic and the Morningside and the Paramount Manor, there were dozens of small and medium sized hotels in and around the hamlet, so even without the Mel Brooks connection, a historic marker in Hurleyville would be appropriate.

The marker dedication, scheduled for 1 p.m. in front of the Hurleyville Performing Arts Centre, is part of a much larger celebration in the hamlet that day that will include an Author’s Row at the Morgan Outdoors shop at 234 Main Street from 2 to 3 pm.

The curated author and artisan line-up will feature a selection of Catskill authors, including this columnist, myself (Sullivan County Historian), as well as artists, books, art, and merchandise.

The Collaborative College High School at 202 Main Street will be hosting “Catskilland” from 1:30 to 4:30 pm, and organizers tout the slideshow as presenting “iconic Sullivan and Ulster County billboards documented for over six decades by Keller Signs, now part of the collection of the Sullivan County Historical Society.”

In addition, the Hurleyville Performing Arts Centre will present a ticketed performance of Sam Sadigursky’s “Solomon Diaries” at 3 pm, and there is much more, with all the events except for the ticketed performance at HPAC free of charge.

It promises to be a real Happening in Hurleyville, with the history of Sullivan County sharing the main stage, so mark your calendars for Sunday, July 21.

MY FAMILY CONNECTION, JUST REDISCOVERED TODAY

Distant relatives owned The Luzon Lodge

in Hurleyville, NY. As my grandmother described it:

The entire family got one room.

The dining roOm had refrigerator boxes for each room, every family had one burner on the communal stove and the seating was in a booth for the entire family.

This was in the 1920’s!!

A joy for mom to go on vacation in the mountains!

(I remember seeing the lodge in the 1970’s and it was in a sad state and closing down.)

NEW YORK UNTAPPED

ISSUE # 1274

In Midtown, 6 ½ Avenue is a series of mid-block crosswalks from 51st Street to 57th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenue, connecting arcades within the dense buildings of Midtown. They are the unique children of the ongoing public-private love affair dotted around New York City called POPS, privately owned public spaces.

The David Rubenstein Public Plaza is one of our favorites, as we’ve seen this atrium go from a climbing wall with sparse activation to a true indoor public space. There are two vertical green walls, a cafe, and plenty of seating. And every Thursday, you are treated to live, world-class music.

If you go looking for this atrium, don’t head to Lincoln Center proper. Enter from either Broadway or Columbus Avenue, between 62nd and 63rd streets. The narrow entrance makes it easily missed, but there is a large overhang above the sidewalk to denote its existence.

Noted architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee originally designed the landmarked tower at 550 Madison, but its public garden atrium recently got a major upgrade designed by Snøhetta. This POPS is now a year-round garden where you can find many seating options among the lush plantings.

Admire the architecture of the New York Public Library’s 42nd Street branch as you seek respite from the heat. You can admire the marble-clad Astor Hall, stroll through the gift shop, and check out rare artifacts from the library’s collections in the Treasures Exhibit. Any New York Public Library makes for a great place to cool down.

NEW YORK UNTAPPED

ISSUE # 1273

Thanks to zoning initiatives, in which the city grants buildings the rights to additional air space (i.e. taller buildings) in exchange for indoor and outdoor public areas, there are quite a few indoor public access areas in the least likely of locations. If you’re looking for a unique meeting spot, want to have a nice quiet lunch, or simply get some “me” time, stop in at one of these indoor public spaces in Manhattan.

A heat wave is here in New York City, with high temperatures forecasted to reach nearly 100 degrees. You can locate the nearest cooling centers here and take refuge in these public places that bring the outdoors in.

This indoor enclosed public space in the Financial District is a spacious atrium replete with fake grass and picnic benches and also includes an outdoor public space on Water Street. Large and spacious, it features plenty of tables and chairs, a food kiosk, two restrooms, an exhibition space, a retail space, and an elevated platform for public events and performances. The outdoor space has benches and trees. This POPS, or Privately Owned Public Space, was recently the site of a memorial for the loss of another POPS location, 60 Wall Street.

Continental Plaza is located at 180 Maiden Lane (between Front and South Streets). Take the 2/3 to Wall Street; 4/5 or J/M to Fulton Street

In one of the plushest atriums, there are literally birds flying around you, singing and chirping. One would be hard-pressed to remember that you’re only a few blocks away from one of the world’s busiest intersections: 57th Street in midtown Manhattan. There are sandwiches, coffee, and free Wifi available for one of the most relaxing hours you will spend! There is also an entrance from here into Trump Tower, should that strike your fancy. Another perk: this building is filled with great art, not only inside the atrium, but the entrance lobby of the building has work by Kenny Scharf, Andy Warhol, Alexander Calder, and Jeff Koons.

The IMB Plaza is located at 590 Madison Avenue (at 57th Street). Take the 4/5/6 or N/R to 59th Street.

The atrium was severely damaged in the September 11th attacks, as almost all the glass panes were blown out by the dust clouds, but it was rebuilt in 2002. Overlooking New York Harbor, this space is home to several yearly events programs and regular indoor art installations. Brookfield Place is also home to a few great food courts, including Le District and Hudson Eats.

Brookfield Place is located at 220 Vesey Street (West of West Street). Take the E train to World Trade Center.

The public space inside One Bryant Park is always a nice stop, with its large, arched sculptural plantings and double-height ground floor. Located on the corner of 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue, the LEED Platinum-certified skyscraper also has some hidden secrets thanks to innovations from the Durst Organization: a rooftop bee farm (we’ve visited and even tried the honey!) and you can actually change the colors of the spire. Remember this spot if you find yourself near Times Square and need somewhere to cool off or seek refuge.

Take the B/D/F/M or 7 to Bryant Park.

This climate change-focused exhibit on Governors Island is the brainchild of Jenny Kendler, whose new activation features intimate, delicate works—all displayed in the cavernous, subterranean magazine of historic Fort Jay, a star-shaped fortification built on Governors Island between 1775 and 1776. Visitors can get up close and personal with pearl sculptures grown inside oysters, bells rung by fossilized whale ear bones, a crystalline whale eye cast of sea salt and human tears, glass vials filled with oil from long dead whales, and a human nervous system meticulously strung from thousands of tiny pearls.

It’s meant to serve as commentary on oysters and whales as cen­tral play­ers in an eco­log­i­cal entan­gle­ment between human and non­hu­man beings, water­ways, and flows of cap­i­tal. Learn more about the exhibit here!

Frida Kahlo’s face has been captured countless times on film and canvas, by herself and by others. With flowers in her hair and her signature dark unibrow, Frida’s striking portrait is an indelible image of the 20th century. Self-portraits account for a large portion of Kahlo’s paintings and she has been photographed by family, friends, lovers, and famous photographers throughout her life. In a new photography exhibit at Throckmorton Fine Art, FRIDA KAHLO: Forever Yours…, visitors can peer into the artist’s portrait in nearly 50 rare and never-before-seen images that capture Kahlo from age two to just before her death at 47.

Kahlo spent most of her life, from 1907 to 1954, in Mexico City. She began painting self-portraits in 1925 while recuperating from a severe bus crash that put her in the hospital for weeks. Kahlo created around 200 still lifes and portraits throughout her life. Today, she is remembered as an artist, a political activist, and a feminist. Her work can be seen at such institutions as the Museum of Modern Art in New York where it hangs among masterpieces by Salvador Dalí and René Magritte.

Many of the images on display in this new exhibit come from founder Spencer Throckmorton’s extensive personal collection of Kahlo portraiture. He’s amassed nearly 200 portraits over the past 50 years. Throckmorton’s fascination with Frida Kahlo began on a trip to her hometown of Mexico City in 1977.

“A friend introduced me to Cristina Kahlo, Frida’s grand-niece, who was selling a photograph by Manuel Álvarez Bravo of Frida with a globe,” Throckmorton shared with Untapped New York, “I bought it, then started researching her. I read Hayden Herrera’s book Frida: The Biography of Frida Kahlo and just fell in love with her. I met her friends, neighbors, and family. And anywhere I could find a picture of Frida, I bought it at flea markets, auctions, everywhere. Once I started, pictures just started coming to me. It was almost magical. Then in the ‘80s, I found two lost paintings of Frida’s – one signed and one not.”

Throckmorton mounted a show of his photographs in 2015, but since then has collected even more. For the current exhibit, he shares fifteen never-seen-before shots. These shots show Frida in a variety of different scenarios between 1930 and 1944.

The portraits on display show Frida in casual intimate moments and staged poses. In a never-before-seen series of black and white shots by her friend Rosa Cavarrubias, Frida lies in the grass, shading her eyes from the sun. Covarrubias, the wife of artist Miguel Covarrubias, was taught photography by Man Ray in Paris. In other images Frida is seen watching an eclipse, smoking a cigarette, kissing her husband Diego Rivera. In many, she gazes straight into the lens, or just out of frame, wearing a contemplative and enigmatic expression.

These moments were captured by noted photographers like Fritz Henle, Lucienne Bloch, Bernard Silberstein, Leo Matiz, Gisele Freund, Manuel Álvarez Bravo and his wife Lola Álvarez Bravo (one of Frida’s lifelong friends), Leon de Vos, Edward Weston, and Sylvia Salmi, a female photographer who also photographed other artists and intellectuals of the time including Albert Einstein, Diego Rivera, and Leon Trotsky. Photographs by people close to Frida, like her father Guillermo Kahlo, also feature in the installation. Guillermo was a well-known photographer in Mexico City.

When we visited the display, a series of portraits by Nickolas Muray, one of Frida’s lovers, stood out. They were taken on Kodak color film sent to Muray by the company. He had to send the film back to Kodak, and the photographer’s estate didn’t regain possession of the photographs he took until decades later. Once the images were returned, about 30 prints were made with the help of an expert who still knew how to develop that particular type of film. Those rare prints are now on sale at Throckmorton Fine Art.

On our trip to Throckmorton Fine Art, NorbertoRivera, Throckmorton’s Director of Photography, took us behind the scenes to see even more images kept in storage. He pulled open large drawers from towering rows of file cabinets. Inside, the drawers were bursting with images of Frida.

Along with the dozens of images on display, visitors to Throckmorton Fine Art will also find an embroidered Mexican blouse worn by Frida that she later gifted to a friend. There are also some examples of Frida’s work on display including a 1953 gouache entitled “The Laugh,” pencil drawings, and other small works. Books that contain photographs from the collection, including the 40th edition of the Taschen monograph Frida Kahlo, are also on view.

See all of these fascinating items for yourself and gain expert insight when you join Untapped New York Insiders for a tour of FRIDA KAHLO: Forever Yours… with Spencer Throckmorton on July 25th. The exhibit is on view through September 28th, 2024.
