Here are some notable horror movies made in and around Toronto and the locations you can still visit.

After the success of Scream (1996), the late '90s were flooded with teen slasher movies. Filmed in Toronto, Urban Legend was one of the more successful movies of that era. Several of Toronto's universities and campuses were used to portray the fictional New England university.
