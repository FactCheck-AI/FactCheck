RBN Web Desk: Veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee has said that he regrets not being able to play Goopy in Satyajit Ray’s adventure-fantasy film Goopy Gyne Bagha Byne. The 1969 film was a blockbuster in Bengali cinema and one of the biggest hits in Ray’s career as a filmmaker.

It may be recalled that Soumitra had bargained hard for the role with Ray. The auteur, however, turned him down saying that he wanted a more commoner look for the character. Soumitra was already an established star by that time, and would not fit into the role of the rustic village simpleton Goopy, Ray had said.

Goopy’s role was finally played by Tapen Chatterjee while Rabi Ghosh was cast as Bagha Byne.

Speaking to the media recently, Soumitra said, when the film released, he realised that none could have played Goopy Gyne better than Tapen.

The 84-year old actor said that he also regrets not being able to play Hamlet on stage. At his age, it’s not possible to play Hamlet but he played the title role in Raja Lear, the Bengali adaptation of William Shakespeare’s King Lear. He always wanted to do more of Shakespeare, but somehow it never materialised, the actor said.

That aside, the thespian said, he wants to work with Kaushik Ganguly. Maybe Kaushik is yet to write a role that suits his age and look, Soumitra said, adding that he may get a chance to work with the Apur Panchali director in near future.
