Gatefold LP

Recorded in S. Francisco in 1970 and originally released on theDouglas label, obscure SHADES OF JOY's Music Of El Topo iscommonly associated with the visionary western-on-acid epic filmEl Topo by Chilean born Ukrainian Jewish multi-medial artistAlejandro Jodorowsky as its soundtrack, despite anotherunrelated album on the Apple label being credited as the truesoundtrack to the flick. Nevertheless, this intriguing piece ofurban jazz funk fusion delivers seven instrumental mantras whose core is neatlyamalgamated by the fine art of a great ensemble, here together only for this seeminglyextemporized job. The idea of "soundtrack" is here superbly interpreted and leaves thelistener puzzled about the short life of this incredible gathering of exceptional musicians.Track listing: Side A: 1.
