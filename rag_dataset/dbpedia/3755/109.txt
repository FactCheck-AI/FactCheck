Dr. Paul Davis, Founder

Paul was born and raised in India, where his parents served as teachers for 36 years. He completed his pre-med degree at Bethany Nazarene College where he met his wife Carol. Following medical school he moved to Wichita for his Family Practice Residency at Wesley Hospital. Currently he is a Family Practice Physician Partner of Primary Care Associates and he has practiced family medicine in Wichita for nearly 40 years.

In 1991 he was involved in starting HopeNet with a vision to provide a comprehensive network of services to those in our community who were involved in a family crisis. For many of these families and individuals, there seemed to be no choices and no hope. Out of that sense of need, HopeNet was born to become a non-judgmental place of safety, guidance, hope and restoration.
