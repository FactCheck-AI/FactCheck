2018 SAUL BELLOW AWARD WINNER

Edmund White

From the judge’s citations: “Unsentimental tenderness, sharply observant wit, and an unsparing examination of the self, mark the fiction of this year’s winner of the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction. The previous winners of this prize have brought to life facets of the American experience. White adds to this accumulated brilliance his early trilogy, an American Epic about coming of age as a gay man in the Midwest, and his later works, often situated in the expatriate’s Paris which has always maintained a rich presence in our national consciousness.”

“To the age of AIDS, the age of loss, the struggle against evangelical Christian hatred, the explosion of gender identities, Edmund White employs a deceptively light touch. He writes about pleasure with amused defiance, and brings questions of moral complexity to bear in relationships with the lost, the troubled, the mortally ill. At the same time, White is life’s great appreciator. His work emanates delight in sensuality, beauty, the intellect, and all that constitutes bliss in this world.”

“Edmund White personifies a cosmopolitan Americanism at home in the world, yet increasingly endangered at home. His great subject is the vexed magnificence of love. His great art is to make that subject belong to everyone. It gives the judges great pleasure to confer the PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction for 2018 upon Edmund White.”

Edmund White is known best for A Boy’s Own Story, The Farewell Symphony, The Beautiful Room Is Empty, and, most recently, Our Young Man.
