St Joseph's works in collaboration with the schools in our Catholic cluster, St Joseph's Rugeley, St Joseph & Teresa's Chasetown, St Mary's Cannock, St Thomas More, Great Wyrley and Cardinal Griffin Catholic College, to support and develop our shared vision for Catholic education and to provide the best possible opportunities for our children.

Our Parish community of Our Lady of Lourdes is integral to the working and faith life development of our pupils and families.
