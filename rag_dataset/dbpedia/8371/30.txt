All the vintage weapons in the world can’t save “The Last Legion,” a strange and slow-moving concoction of swordfights and snooze-inducing drama.

A kind of “Ancient Rome for Dummies,” “The Last Legion” was helmed by Doug Lefler, whose most recognizable directing work can be found in episodes of “Xena: Warrior Princess” and “Mortal Kombat: Conquest.” Sure, you’ll get your fill of elaborate costumes and European accents, but sooner or later you’ll be yearning for some thrills.

The story is a fictionalized tale of the last emperor of Rome, 12-year-old whippersnapper Romulus Augustus (Thomas Sangster of “Love Actually”). A day after he takes the throne, his mother and father are murdered by overzealous Goths.

Put under the wing of his friend and bodyguard, Aurelius (Colin Firth), and his teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley), Romulus is exiled to the remote island of Capri. From there the death scenes grow wearier, the characters’ names get trickier and the excitement sinks like a stone.

What would an action-fantasy be without a stunning female lead? Here it’s Mira (Aishwarya Rai), a sultry warrior who makes her entrance by emerging from the sea.

Full of scruffy men in robes, women in peasant outfits and horses running amok, Lefler’s film tries hard but goes nowhere. Screenwriters Jez and Tom Butterworth (“Birthday Girl”) even mix traces of “The Sword and the Stone” into the plot – believe it or not, Romulus eventually finds the legendary Excalibur. Yes, that Excalibur.

When it comes to sword-and-sandal epics, “The Last Legion” is firmly at the bottom of the heap.
