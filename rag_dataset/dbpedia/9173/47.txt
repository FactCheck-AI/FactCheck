In 1917, following the February Revolution, the Ukrainian War of Independence took place, which ended in 1921 with the territory divided between Soviet Ukraine and the Second Polish Republic. The Ukrainian territory was attached to the Soviet Union until 1991, when it became an independent state.

In 2014, after a few months of internal crisis after the then president Yanukovych rejected the agreement of association with the European Union, Russia took the opportunity to occupy and annex the strategically important Crimean peninsula, opening a conflict that has never been closed.

Culture and interests

Ukrainian culture is very rich and diverse. Ukrainian traditions are hundreds of years old and most of them stem from Orthodox Christianity, which is the dominant religion in the country.

One of the most typical Ukrainian customs is Easter eggs, known as p√Ωsankys, which at this time of year are covered with wax and then painted with bright colours. This tradition goes back thousands of years.

The sunflower is the national flower of Ukraine. Brought from North America, it is known as sunyashniki, and for the Slavic peoples it represented the power of the Sun. These days it is becoming a symbol of the Ukrainian people's resistance.
