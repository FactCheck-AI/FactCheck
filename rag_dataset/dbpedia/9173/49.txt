Changing Money

It’s fairly difficult, if not impossible, to buy or sell Ukrainian currency outside of Ukraine/Eastern Europe. We advise waiting until you arrive in Ukraine before changing money. You’ll have no problems whatsoever. There are currency exchanges on virtually every major street in Ukraine. Euros, dollars, sterling, and many other currencies are readily accepted. However, worn or tattered notes are usually rejected.

Spend or exchange any Ukrainian currency before you leave the country unless you require it for a subsequent visit.
