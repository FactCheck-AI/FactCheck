Oxford-born artist Samantha Jayne Hoare is a Folk & Americana inspired singer/songwriter. Her powerful, transcendent vocals and vibrant performance energy set her apart as an artist, bringing sophistication and flair to every show.

Cutting her teeth in the vivacious city of Leeds, she is a recent BA (Hons) graduate in Popular Music, and studied under the guidance many of the industry's leading songwriters, arrangers and artistic directors at Leeds College of Music. But having been raised in a vibrant Folk scene in her Oxfordshire hometown, she focuses on adding her own brand of Roots & Rock edge to both her original songs and covers, priding herself on her ability to deliver new takes on old favorites.

She's a versatile performer, constantly updating her set with Rock, Country, and Modern Pop tracks, able to bring high performance energy for a late night sing-a-long, or set the mood with chilled acoustic pop. She also utilizes the pioneering vocal effects technology of TC-Helicon, including looping effects. With almost a decade's worth of performance experience, she also belongs to several popular Leeds-based artist agencies as well as managing her own freelance gigs.

She is also a prolific songwriter, performing her original Roots/Americana music under the name Ramona Rose, a successful solo project that has already seen her embark on a solo UK Summer tour, appear on BBC Radio in Leeds and Oxford, and appear on line-ups with the likes of Misty Miller, KT Tunstall, and Jon Boden of Bellowhead.
