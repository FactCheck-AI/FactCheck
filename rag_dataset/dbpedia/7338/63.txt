Opened by Eugenio López Alonso, the owner of the biggest juice company in Mexico, Jumex, this museum houses his private collection of contemporary art and temporary exhibitions that change every few months. It is located in Polanco, neighbored by Museo Soumaya, another architectural icon in the city.

Apart from all the big-name exhibitions, Museo Jumex is seriously investing in the local scene, sponsoring, commissioning and supporting works by local artists, arts publications and galleries. I really enjoy the international exhibits and getting to know the work of artists that I didn't know about before.

If you plan on going during the weekend, I recommend you to get your tickets before hand, since they have a maximum capacity each day and can get really busy during the weekend, especially on Sundays, since it's free!

The museum has a small, delicious café where you can sit and enjoy the nice weather while you wait for your time to get inside.
