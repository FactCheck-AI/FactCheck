In 2007, the American Film Institute released an updated list of their top 100 movies of all time. The list is far from perfect—aside from not being updated for more than a decade, the collection lacks any female directors, and M. Night Shyamalan and Spike Lee are the only two directors of color with films featured on the list, for The Sixth Sense (#89) and Do the Right Thing (#96), respectively. However, the AFI Top 100 list is still full of incredible, if not diverse, films—and it’s as good a starting point as any for considering which movies have made the biggest impact on American culture.

Film buffs and readers alike may be interested to know that books played a very large role in inspiring many of the movies on the AFI Top 100 List. Forty-five of the movies on the list were based on books, and another eight were based on short stories. In other words, more than half of the films on the list have literary roots.

Below, a full list of all the movies on the AFI Top 100 list that were based on books and short stories.

Note: This list does not include films based on plays, such as A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), or West Side Story (1961).
