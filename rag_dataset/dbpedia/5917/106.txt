Derby, Bojanala Region

Derby is located about 15 km east of Koster. The town was named after Lord Derby, British secretary of State, and had its origins as a settlement for destitute people.

Towards the end of the Anglo-Boer War the area was the scene for a battle between the Boer forces and a Scottish Calvary Regiment. The graves of the British soldiers who died here may be seen in the Derby's military cemetery.
