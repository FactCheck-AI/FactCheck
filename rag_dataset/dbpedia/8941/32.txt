The Byzantine emperors in Constantinople struck a gold coin called a solidus, which was the most important trade coin of the early Middle Ages. Under the banner of Islam, proclaimed by Muhammad (571-632), the Arabs conquered Byzantine Syria and Egypt and the Sasanian Empire under the first four Orthodox Caliphs. The Umayyad Caliphs (661-750) extended Muslim power from the Indus to the Atlantic. Early Islamic coinage imitated the Sasanian silver drahm (dirham in Arabic) and the Byzantine gold solidus and copper follis (dinar and fuls in Arabic). In 696, Caliph Abd-al-Malik struck the first Muslim gold dinars and silver dirhams bearing religious inscriptions—the pattern for most subsequent Muslim coinage.

The Reforms of Anastasius I

Constantinople (formerly Byzantium) became the capital of the eastern Roman Empire in 330. The Byzantine monetary system began once Anastasius I (491-518) reformed the old Roman coinage in 498. Coins were now marked with Greek letters (I=10, K=20, M=40) indicating their value in nummi, the smallest monetary unit. The 40-nummus piece was called follis(“purse”) because it had the value of a purse of nummi.

The 6th and 7th Centuries

At the height of its power, the Byzantine Empire under Justinian I (527-565) reclaimed areas of Italy, Sicily and North Africa lost to the Goths and Vandals. Heraclius (610-641) pushed back the Sasanian Persian armies of Khusru II (591-628) and restored the True Cross to Jerusalem. However, by the time of Constans II (641-668), the Islamic Arabs had taken over large sections of the Empire.

Symbols of a Christian Empire

Many of the images found on Byzantine coins are derived from Christian religious icons and artwork decorating the great churches and palaces of Constantinople. The rule of the Emperor was believed to be sanctioned by God.

The Reforms of Alexius I Comnenus

Inheriting a monetary system that had become extremely debased under his predecessors, Alexius I (1081-1118) reformed the coinage in 1092. He replaced the old histamenon with the hyperpyron, a slightly debased gold coin. A new electrum-alloy aspron trachy was valued at one-third of a hyperpyron. Alexius also introduced the small bronze tetarteron which drove the old heavy folles out of circulation.

The Venetian Standard

The Byzantine Empire never really recovered after the Crusaders sacked Constantinople in 1204 and established a Latin Empire in formerly Byzantine territory. In 1261, the Palaeologan family returned from exile to rule a diminished Empire, but the glory days of Byzantine economic power were gone. In the 14th century, Byzantine trachys followed the internationally accepted weight standard.

Early Islamic Coinage

The first Muslims continued to use the familiar coins of the Byzantine and Sasanian Persian Empires, and made new coins imitating them. Later, in 695, the image of the Caliph was substituted, but it was soon replaced by entirely inscriptional designs.

Dirhams and Dinars

In 697, an Islamic coinage was invented based on the gold dinar (from the Roman denarius) and the silver dirham (from the Greek drachma). Images were replaced by words from the Qur’an. For decades, the coinage was anonymous, issued in the name of God instead of an earthly ruler. In 763, the names of the Caliph and his officials were restored to the coinage.

The Western Islamic World

In the Islamic West (Spain, Sicily and North Africa), diverse coin designs, such as the Fatimid circle design, were often used to signal independence from the Abbisid Caliphate of the East.

Figural Islamic Coins

Traditional Islamic coins use no figural images, but some Turkish and Mughal rulers did produce coins with images, often representing astrological signs. Some of the iconography is derived from coins struck centuries earlier, suggesting the existence of medieval coin collections.

The Mongols

The Mongol invasion of the Middle East under Genghis Khan (1155-1227) affected Islamic coinage. Iran’s Il-Khan Mongol dynasty introduced decorative frames while retaining the traditional inscriptional style. Multilingual inscriptions were used, reflecting the cultural diversity of the people ruled by the Mongols. Some powerful rulers did not claim authority in their own right, but marked their coins with the names of weak overlords.
