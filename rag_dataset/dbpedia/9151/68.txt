Keyboardist Bruce Hornsby is working on a new Noisemakers studio album and recently shared a very interesting photo on Facebook showing a musical legend who is expected to be featured on a track.

The great Mavis Staples recorded a track with Bruce and the band in her hometown of Chicago. Bruce Hornsby & The Noisemakers last released a new studio album in 2009 with Levitate. We can’t wait to hear this what this collaboration sounds like. Bruce is currently off the road until April.
