FC Barcelona was founded in 1899 by a group of Swiss, Spanish, English, and Catalan footballers led by Joan Gamper. The club won its first Copa del Rey in 1910, and their first league title in 1929. The club was forced to change their name in 1938 to Club de Futbol Barcelona and also had to remove the Catalan flag from the crest. This happened because of Italian rule. In 1957, the Camp Nou opened. In 1974, the club changed its name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and went back to using the original crest with the Catalan flag and the red and blue colors. Barcelona won their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1979 against Fortuna Düsseldorf, and won again three years later. A year later, in 1983, the club won their first Supercopa de España. The club won its first Champions League in 1992 against U.C. Sampdoria. In 1992, they also achieved a treble, winning their first UEFA Super Cup and the league title, along with the Champions League. From 1990 to 1994, Barcelona won four consecutive league titles with Johan Cruyff.[3]
