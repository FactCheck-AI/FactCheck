Have a look at the Spanish Super Cup winners list and the team with the record for most trophies and more

The Supercopa de Espaa is a football competition with a long history in Spain that traditionally pits the League champion against the Copa del Rey winner. The format has changed since there has also been a four-way final, featuring the La Liga runner-up and the Cup finalist, over two legs (at home and away), as well as in a single format.

Which team has the most Spanish Super Copa titles?

The champions of the Supercopa de Espana are numerous and diverse. FC Barcelona and Real Madrid have a significant amount of dominance. Atlético de Madrid is third in contention, but groups like Deportivo de La Corua, Athletic de Bilbao, Valencia, RCD Mallorca, Sevilla FC, Real Zaragoza, and Real Sociedad each have at least one championship to their names.

There is also €1 million up for grabs for the runners-up and €2 million for the champions in 2023 as the prize money. That means if Barcelona or Real Madrid win the tournament, they would receive €4.8 million in total.

Real Madrid and FC Barcelona are the two groups that have won the vast majority of championships and finished second in the Supercopa de Espaa. There is a great deal of equality between them, just as there has been throughout the history of Spanish football, even in the Supercopa competition.

Behind them are Athletic Bilbao, Atlético Madrid, and Deportivo La Corua. The Lions are a side with a strong Copa del Rey tradition in addition to their La Liga success, but with the implementation of the “Bosman Law,” they understandably lost a lot of strength because they only have players from the Basque Country or Navarre.

Other prominent teams from the third stage, suchas Valencia, RCD Mallorca, Sevilla FC, Real Zaragoza, and Real Sociedad, have at least one championship in their trophy cases. Despite competing in the Spanish Super Cup, teams like Real Betis and RCD Espanyol did not take home the championship.
