It's only a number.

Or is it?

No. 42. It's not just another number in baseball. It's the jersey number of Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947.

MLB retired the Hall of Famer's number in 1997 – 50 years after his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Now, the last player to wear the No. 42 – Mariano Rivera – will follow in Robinson's footsteps into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday, along with Mike Mussina, the late Roy Halladay, Edgar Martinez, Harold Baines and Lee Smith.

Rivera wore No. 42 when he began his career with the New York Yankees and was permitted to keep the number until he retried in 2013.

And like Rivera and Robinson, many other elite players are identified by their jersey number.
