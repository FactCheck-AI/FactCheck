Beethoven depictions influenced by Auguste Rodin

Naoum Aronson's Beethoven monument in Bonn

The second student of Rodin who concentrated on designing a monument for Beethoven was the Latvian sculptor Naoum Aronson (1873-1943).

In the summer of 1905 Naoum Aronson visited the concerts of the seventh Bonn Chamber Music Festival organised by the Beethoven-House. Under the impression of the performed music, the sculptor already began his first studies for a Beethoven bust during his visit.
