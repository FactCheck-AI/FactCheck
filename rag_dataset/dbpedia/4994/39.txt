Wells Fargo & Co. is looking at essentially buying insurance on some of the loans in its portfolio using a transaction known as a synthetic risk transfer, potentially becoming the latest big bank to use the product to cope with looming capital rules.

The San Francisco-based lender is in early discussions for an SRT tied to a portfolio of subscription lines, a type of credit extended to private equity funds, according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named as the details arenâ€™t public. Conversations are preliminary and details of the financing may change, they added. The transaction may come later this year, the people said.
