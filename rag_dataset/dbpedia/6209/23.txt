FOREWORD

Mr. K K Sharma Border Security Force was raised on 1st December 1965 for guarding

6387-kilometer-long international boundary of Indo-Pak and Indo-

Director General (DG) Bangladesh borders. With its unflinching dedication to call of duty, in its

sterling dual role in ‘Peace and War’ times, BSF has earned itself many a

golden moments in the history of Nation building.

BSF stands guard as the impregnable wall defending the motherland

and its citizens. With sustained community interface programmes, BSF

has been at the forefront of fulfilling the Governments’ objective of

ensuring socio economic development of people inhabiting border areas.

In discharge of social obligations to Nation and society with post life

Organ donation drive, BSF has taken its call of duty on a higher calling,

from ‘जीवन पय्र� क�र्�’ to ‘जीवन उपरांत क�्र�’. The eco-friendly initiatives

like Rain Water harvesting, use of bio-digesters etc. in BSF premises are

contributing to reduce the carbon footprint. Numerous welfare activities

have been undertaken in recent times to alleviate the living standards

of BSF personnel. Energies have been focused, so that these measures

reach every Borderman and their families. Inclusion of programmes like

financial literacy, online learning module – prepmantra, skill development

programmes are aimed for holistic well-being of the force personnel.

Assimilating the onward march of excellence with courage & compassion,

a coffee table book has been envisaged and brought forward to chronicle

the humane and valiant face of Border Security Force.

With the supreme sacrifices of 1865 valiant Bordermen on the altar of

duty and more than 2000 decorations on roll of Honour, BSF reiterates

unflinching resolve to live upto its motto of ‘जीवन पय र्� क� ्र�’ in the

service of motherland.

Wherever this book reaches, I hope, it will familiarise the reader with

interesting details of versatility of BSF functioning and they will recognize

wonderful contributions of combined teams of Seema Praharis in Nation

building.

I am also confident that this pictorial display will inspire each Seema

Prahari to seek greater level of professional excellence in all that they do-

paving the way for greater glory and accomplishments by Border Security

Force.

JAI HIND.

Genesis In the initial years of border guarding, the nascent

force handled challenges by using improvised

The 1960’s proved momentous in India’s methods for observation posts, bunkers and

history as the Indo-China conflict of 1962, other infrastructural needs.

the Indo – Pakistan war of 1965, the rise of

insurgency in North - East India and the rise 9

of Nationalism in Bengal in the erstwhile

East Pakistan created the context for the

genesis of the Border Security Force – a

service dedicated to defending the long

Indian border.

The inadequacy of the State Reserve Police

(SRP) and the Central Reserve Force in

challenging the Pakistan forces in Gujarat

in 1965, set the stage for the formation of a

Central Force to protect the borders of the

country. A report by a study group led by Lt

Gen Kumaramangalem, the Vice Chief of the

Indian Army in April 1965 which prepared

the blue print for raising the BSF with expert

inputs from various agencies. In May 1965,

a meeting of the Home Minister and the

Police Chiefs of all the states was held at

the behest of Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, then

Prime Minister, in Delhi concluding with

the Prime Minister’s decision to raise a new

Central Force dedicated to the defence of

Indian borders.

Shri Khusro Faramurj Rustamji, IP

Founder DG of BSF

It was on 21 July 1965 that Shri Khusro Faramurj Rustamji,

IP was appointed the founder DG of BSF following which an

adhoc committee of Secretaries met in New Delhi On 16 Nov

1965 and agreed to the establishment of the Border Security

Force which was officially raised on 01 Dec 1965 under Article

356 of the constitution.

The birth pangs of the BSF as described in Rustamji’s own

words give an insight into the genesis of BSF. “I was called

to Delhi in May 1965 and asked to take over the responsibility

of raising the force. After handing over charge as IGP Madhya

Pradesh, I reached Delhi and wrote my joining report on 21 July

1965 and became the head of a one man organisation. I raised

it and nurtured it for nine long years. I was the sole Border

man; nobody below me, nobody above me...”

scientists Shri Vikram Sarabhai and Shri APJ Abdul Kalam

The 1971 War on

Western Front

BSF units from Kutch (Gujarat) to Kupwara in J&K who were deployed

on the border proved their mettle even in their infancy by participating

in defensive and offensive operations with the Indian Army. They also

undertook many independent operations, capturing many enemy posts

and inflicting heavy casualties. The 14 BN BSF was bestowed the title of

“Sentinels of the Thar” for their heroic deeds in Longewala operations

while in the Gurudaspur-Dera Baba Nanak sector of Punjab, the BSF

delivered a crushing blow to the enemy and captured as many as 14 BOPs.

The BSF came out of this first major test after its inception with flying

colours notwithstanding the serious limitations that beset the new force.

Shri V V Giri, Former President of India commented on the role of BSF in

the 1971 war by saying, “The role of BSF in 1971 war won for it the unstinted

admiration of the entire nation. The BSF forged great camaraderie with the

Indian Army with whom they fought shoulder to shoulder”.

Tackling Terrorism in Punjab

Anti-terrorist BSF operations in Punjab can be traced to

mid 1980s when the BSF was involved in countering cross

border terrorism 1984 onwards when some of its battalions

functioned under the overall control of the Punjab Police.

In these early operations, the BSF achieved notable success

in neutralising Baba Ranjit Singh, a Category A hardcore

Khalistan terrorist in Batala Sector on 24 June 1986,

eliminating self-styled General Labh Singh alias Suchha Singh

on 12 July 1988 and other dreaded terrorists in more than

100 successful operations. In conjunction with pressure

mounted on the border, this contributed substantially in

tackling militancy in Punjab. The flushing out of Khalistan

terrorists from Mand Region of Punjab stretching 150

Kilometres between the river Sutlej and Beas in the districts

of Amritsar, Ferozpur, Jallandhar and Kapurthala in an area

full of swamps and marshes, drew praise from the Governor

of Punjab and the Union Home Minister.
