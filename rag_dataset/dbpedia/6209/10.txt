Samura Kamara, the Leader for Sierra Leone’s main opposition party, the All People’s Congress (APC), is scheduled to appear in court today, Wednesday, July 19, 2023, along with several others, facing charges related to corruption allegations

The judiciary has confirmed SLBC, AYV, FTN, and Star TV will broadcast the proceedings live, while access to the courtroom remains restricted solely to accredited journalists and lawyers.

Dr. Samura Kamara faces corruption charges related to the alleged misappropriation of public funds during his tenure as Sierra Leone’s Minister of Foreign Affairs in the previous APC administration.

Specifically, he is accused of mismanaging funds designated for renovating Sierra Leone’s Chancery Building in New York.

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) claims Dr. Kamara misled authorities and mishandled public funds, allegations vehemently denied by the former minister, who maintains they are politically motivated to tarnish his reputation and image.
