Netflix has picked up the animated feature White Fang and is planning a 2018 release.

The children’s movie, which premiered at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, is based on the Jack London story about a wolf torn between domestication and life in the wild. Rashida Jones, Eddie Spears, Nick Offerman and Paul Giamatti voice star.

Superprod, Bidibul Productions and Big Beach are behind the animation that was directed by Alexandre Espigares, who won an Oscar for his 2014 animated short Mr. Hublot.

Dominique Monfery, Philippe Lioret and Serge Frydman wrote the feature, which was produced by Clément Calvet, Jérémie Fajner, Lilian Eche, Christel Henon, Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf.

UTA Independent Film Group negotiated the deal on behalf of the filmmakers.
