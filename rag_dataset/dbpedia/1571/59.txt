Understand how systems plan and react post-perception for use cases ranging from adaptive mission planning to high-risk manned-unmanned teaming operations. Test planning and controls module performance in object-level simulations across thousands of relevant virtual scenarios, varying actors, vehicles, and obstacles, and trace each test scenario back to program requirements.

The future fight will involve multiple heterogeneous unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) collaborating to achieve mission objectives. Integrate autonomy from multiple vendors or programs to understand how they will interact and collaborate when deployed side-by-side and faced with a battlefield scenario.
