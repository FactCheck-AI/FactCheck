Command Line (CopasiSE)

No files are created or modified when the option --validate is given.

Simulation Engine

Time Course Task: The methods RADAU5 not correctly supports the option Suppress Output Before ...

Time Course Task: The hybrid methods Hybrid LSODA & Hybrid Runge-Kutta now supports automatic step size correctly.

Optimization and Parameter Estimation Tasks: The method Praxis now correctly terminates if the if solution is within the tolerance.

Parameter Estimation Task: The Method Evolution Strategy (SRES) checks not the functional constraints like other methods.

Metabolic Control Analysis and Linear Noise Approximation Tasks: The result now contains the Steady-State result.

New Features

Standards

SBML: Added support of SBML Level 3 Version 2

Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Event Overview: The assignments associated with an event are no properly displayed.

Optimization: Changing of the subtask is now preserved without running the optimization task.

Task and subtask names are now consistently handled in sensitivities, optimization, and scan.

Scan Task: Improved handling of output from subtask by allowing finer control over when output is captured.

Simulation Engine

Fix calculations involving constant rates which were in certain situations (e.g. event assignments) not correctly updated.

Language Bindings

In the case that multiple data models with the same name where loaded simultaneously, renaming an object in one data model does not longer effect references the other models.

Setting CCopasiParameter values directly will now result in a call to the parent group to assure proper synchronization of related parameters.

SBML Import: Avoid redundant division by log(10) when importing logarithm with base 10.

SBML Import (layout): Allow import of empty curves.

SED-ML Import: Improved import of SED-ML files with multiple task lists, falling back to SBML when all fail.

Release Date: May 31, 2023

New Features

The is a bug fix release and does not include new features

Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Fixed issue where loading a parameter estimation protocol in which the values had been sorted externally lead to incorrect parameter mapping.

Show both modification and creation time entities in local time.

Fixed plot for parameter estimation results for steady state experiments to properly map the independent data.

The parameter estimation result now includes a counter for failed constraints.

Fixed crash when deleting all global quantities.

Simulation Engine

Fixed temporary directory for export of Combine and Shiny archives to address security restrictions on MacOS X.

Stochastic simulation methods now correctly report whether they support events and thus whether they can be used for the simulation of model with events.

Standards

SBML import: Fixed issue where it was not possible to change the delay of an imported event.

SBML import: Fixed crash caused by particular unit definitions during importing.

SBML import: Fixed import of reaction kinetics which occasionally lost the parameter mapping.

SBML import: Handle references to missing modifier species in reactions gracefully.

SBML export: Reduced warnings about Model History not being exported to only check the model itself and not all model components.
