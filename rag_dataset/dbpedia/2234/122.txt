Command Line (CopasiSE)

No files are created or modified when the option –validate is given.

Simulation Engine

Time Course Task: The methods RADAU5 now correctly supports the option Suppress Output Before …

Time Course Task: The hybrid methods Hybrid LSODA & Hybrid Runge-Kutta now supports automatic step size correctly.

Optimization and Parameter Estimation Tasks: The method Praxis now correctly terminates if the if solution is within the tolerance.

Parameter Estimation Task: The Method Evolution Strategy (SRES) now checks the functional constraints like other methods.

Metabolic Control Analysis and Linear Noise Approximation Tasks: The result now contains the Steady-State result.

New Features

Standards

SBML: Added support of SBML Level 3 Version 2

Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Event Overview: The assignments associated with an event are no properly displayed.

Optimization: Changing of the subtask is now preserved without running the optimization task.

Task and subtask names are now consistently handled in sensitivities, optimization, and scan.

Scan Task: Improved handling of output from subtask by allowing finer control over when output is captured.

Simulation Engine

Fix calculations involving constant rates which were in certain situations (e.g. event assignments) not correctly updated.

Language Bindings

In the case that multiple data models with the same name where loaded simultaneously, renaming an object in one data model does not longer effect references the other models.

Setting CCopasiParameter values directly will now result in a call to the parent group to assure proper synchronization of related parameters.

Release Date: December 1, 2023

We have chosen to quickly release a fix for a UI problem which resulted in not displaying the results of any task after the first run. Especially for lengthy tasks this seriously impacted the usability of the software.

New Features

Simulation Engine

Scan task: implemented support iterating through parameter sets.

Optimization & Parameter Estimation: It is now possible to run current solution statistics before adding any optimization parameters.

Bug Fixes

Graphical User Interface (CopasiUI)

Fixed issue were results of tasks were not properly displayed after the first run of the task.

Fixed scan task to correctly show parameter estimation results.
