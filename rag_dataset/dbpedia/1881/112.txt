The Score's song 'Hunger' is a powerful anthem that delves into the relentless drive and ambition that fuels individuals to push beyond their limits. The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a metaphorical jungle, where survival of the fittest is the rule. The 'cold streets' coming alive and the emphasis on not being humble highlight the competitive nature of the world, where only the strong and determined can thrive. This setting serves as a backdrop for the song's central theme: an insatiable hunger for success and fulfillment.

The chorus, with its repeated question 'Can you feel the hunger?', underscores the intensity of this drive. The hunger described here is not just a physical need but a deep, almost primal urge to achieve and conquer. The lines 'Never, ever, satisfied, gotta feed this appetite / Before it pulls me under' suggest that this hunger is a double-edged sword. While it propels individuals forward, it also has the potential to consume them if not managed properly. This duality adds depth to the song, making it a reflection on the balance between ambition and self-preservation.

The imagery of breaking out of a cage and the call of the wild further reinforces the theme of untamed ambition. The protagonist sees themselves as an 'animal you can't hold down,' emphasizing their unstoppable nature. The nights being a time of inspiration and the fights being faced without fear highlight the resilience and determination required to pursue one's goals. 'Hunger' by The Score is a rallying cry for anyone who has ever felt the burning desire to achieve greatness, reminding them that this hunger, while powerful, must be harnessed carefully to avoid being overwhelmed by it.
