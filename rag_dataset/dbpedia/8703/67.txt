90s sitcom 'Birds Of A Feather' is to return to our screens â€“ but on ITV rather than on its original home on the BBC.

Original stars Pauline Quirke, Linda Robson and Lesley Joseph are to reprise their roles for an eight-episode run.

Writers Laurence Marks and Maurice Gran reportedly took the idea to the Beeb, but it only wanted to make a one-off Christmas special.

Instead ITV has now snapped up the show, which regularly pulled in 20 million viewers.
