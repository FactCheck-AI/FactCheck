Dame Rose Tremain is to chair the judging panel for the Lucy Cavendish Fiction Prize, which is sponsored by Peter Frasers + Dunlop (PFD).

Now in its 13th year, the prize hosted by Cambridge University and is open to women over the age of 18 who submit the first 50 pages of their novel. The winner receives £1,500, while all shortlisted entrants will receive one-to-one consultation with a PFD agent if they are not already represented.

Tremain was educated at the Sorbonne and is a graduate of the University of East Anglia, where she taught creative writing from 1988 to 1995 and was chancellor from 2013 to 2016.

Her novels and short stories have been published worldwide in 27 countries and have won prizes including the Sunday Express Book of the Year Award, the Prix Femina Etranger, the Whitbread Novel of the Year Award and the Orange Prize for Fiction 2008. Her latest novel Lily (Vintage) was a Richard & Judy Bookclub pick.

“I’m delighted to be chairing the judges of the excellent Lucy Cavendish Prize, 2023," Tremain said. "Discovering new voices in fiction is always really exciting and I’m hoping to see a wonderful, diverse and seductive gathering of talent come my way this year.”

Tremain succeeds Jackie Ashley in the role. The panel will also include: Tim Bates, head of the PFD books department and literary agent; Dr Isobel Maddison, fellow emerita of Lucy Cavendish College; editor and ghost-writer Gillian Stern; Lindsey Traub; and HarperCollins editorial director Phoebe Morgan. Also joining the panel this year is Reeta Chakrabarti, BBC News presenter and correspondent, and writer and assistant director Sheena Patel.
