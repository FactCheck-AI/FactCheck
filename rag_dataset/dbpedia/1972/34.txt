New Delhi: Internet search giant Google on Tuesday paid tributes to Pakistani singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan on his birth anniversary.

The doodle showed the musician singing, his left hand raised to make the letter “l” in the word Google.

Born on October 13, 1948, Khan was primarily a singer of qawwali, the devotional music of the Sufis.

The singer died of a cardiac arrest at the age of 49 on August 16, 1997.

Last week, another Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali cancelled his concert in Maharashtra after Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt it.
