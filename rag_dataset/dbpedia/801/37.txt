The amazing and still ever so popular Newton's Cradle.

Sir Isaac Newton was an English physicist and mathematician (described in his own day as a "natural philosopher") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time. It is quite amazing that he is still held in very high regard even by todays scientists. One of the things that we have to remember his work by is the humble but intriguing Newton’s Cradle. It is one of the most recognisable desktop gadgets in the world and has never lost its appeal among office clerks to CEO’s of large international companies. In fact, you wouldn't be surprised to see it on the desk of any self-respecting executive. But it is not only for them, it’s for us all, and especially Dads on Father’s Day or on any other special occasion. This executive gadget is a fine executive gadget and considering its size is very good value. Just think of the therapy as you watch the balls bounce off each other displaying the wonders of the forces of physics and how they interact, plus it looks cool!

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction the Newton's Cradle, executive toy perfectly demonstrates conservation of energy and momentum. Each ball is attached to opposite sides of the frame by equal length strings. Pull back and release one of the balls and let it swing back, creating a force that propagates through the other balls creating a hypnotic motion. Great Executive gift.
