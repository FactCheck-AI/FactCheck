Newtonâ€™s cradle or balance balls is one of the oldest, most interesting physics toys that demonstrate the laws of conservation of energy and momentum (and much more). You just raise one, two or three balls on one end, let them go and watch what happens on the other side. Great for physics demonstrations of conservation of momentum or as a desk toy/stress reducer, and makes a great gift.
