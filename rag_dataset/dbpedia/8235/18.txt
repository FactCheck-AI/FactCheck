He received 116,345 votes—18,408 less than Democrat Walter Vohdin, who finished ninth among the Democratic winners.[2]

Giuliano was elected to the New Jersey State Senate in 1967 in the 11th District. He won a close Republican primary, running at-Large for six Essex County Senate seats. The winners were former Assemblyman James Wallwork (21,156), former Assemblyman Geraldo Del Tufo (19,889), former Newark Judge Alexander Matturri (19,723), former Livingston Mayor David Dowd (19,245), and West Orange attorney Milton Waldor (19,243).

He easily won a contested Republican primary, outpolling Donald Blasi by 17,829 votes.[5] In the general election, he was again the top vote getter countywide, with 92,166. He was followed by Democrat Ralph DeRose (91,380), Wallwork (88,632), Democratic Assemblyman Frank J.

Giuliano lost his bid for re-election to a third term in the Democratic landslide of 1973, losing to Democrat Carmen Orechio by 3,483 votes in the Democratic landslide of 1973, 29,878 (53%) to 26,395 (47%). He ran in the new 27th District following a redistricting.[7]
