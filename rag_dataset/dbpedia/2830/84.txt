Holmestrand station is a railway station located inside the mountains, as part of the Holmestrandsporten tunnel.

The new Holmestrand Station is a railway station on the Vestfold Line (a railway line that runs from Drammen, through a number of towns in Vestfold and ending in the town of Skien in Telemark) located in the town of Holmestrand in Vestfold, Norway. It is located inside the tunnel Holmestrandsporten. There is an elevator from the top of Holmestrand mountain, 70 meters down to the station hall. There are two entrances to the station. The southern entrance is closest to the city center. The north is a little further away, but has a public transport terminal and parking.

Concourse

The concourse has four tracks and two platforms. It is about 870 meters long, 30 meters wide and about 12 meters high. The platforms are about 250 meters long. The train station is the first in the world to combine platforms and high-speed trains that drive through the station with a speed of 250 km/h. The pressure relief tunnel is one of several measures that will prevent people on the platform from experiencing an unpleasant pressure every time a high-speed train passes by. In addition, the tunnel inlets are shaped like trumpets.

Concrete Supplies

HeidelberCement's subsidiary NorBetong set up a mobile mixer in Holmestrand to provide the construction project, ie both the tunnel and the station hall. In addition to concrete deliveries, HeidelberCement's subsidiary Norcem has supplied large amounts of cement for injection and sealing in the tunnel.
