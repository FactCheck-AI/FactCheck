Former UK health secretary Matt Hancock is giving evidence to the Covid inquiry, becoming the latest high-profile politician to be grilled on the government’s response to the pandemic.

Mr Hancock was partly responsible – alongside former prime minister Boris Johnson – for steering the UK’s decision-making and messaging on coronavirus, and his recollections of the event are likely to form a crucial piece of Lady Hallett’s inquiry.

He was previously been criticised over elements of the government’s response, including a perceived lack of transparency surrounding the awarding of lucrative personal protective equipment (PPE) contracts to businesses.

He’s already announced he won’t be re-standing for his West Suffolk constituency at the next general election, but Mr Hancock’s career hasn’t been without controversy.

He was notably forced to resign from his cabinet post in June 2021 after it was found that he breached social distancing guidance by kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo, the CCTV footage of which went viral on social media. Earlier this year, a leak of more than 100,000 of his WhatsApp messages by journalist Isabel Oakeshott to The Daily Telegraph further outlined a glimpse into the workings of the government during lockdown.

Here’s a timeline of Mr Hancock’s occasionally scandal-hit and frequently unflatteringly-photographed time in Westminster.
