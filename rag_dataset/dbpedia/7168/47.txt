Julie Andrews accepted the Rhode Island International Film Festival's Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of her husband, director Blake Edwards.

Edwards, 79, was "frustrated and deeply apologetic that he cannot be with us tonight" to accept his award, Andrews said Wednesday. "He came down with a nasty bout of pneumonia and a very high fever." He was resting at home on New York's Long Island.
