The remix was created by Josh Kouzomis (Troublemaker) and Eric Moss (E.Moss) of Backyard Bangers, with additional production by Mickey Petralia, and features guest vocals by Phoenix Orion.

Troublemaker spoke to Linkin Park fans about the remix on July 25, 2002 during a chat on linkinpark.com:

"Hi, this is troublemaker and Emoss, we are the Backyard Bangers And we are really happy with how Runaway (our featured track) worked out We had our friend Phoenix Orion do a rhyme at the bridge of the song

I met Joe at some hip hop nights around town, and met him through a friend We had friends that were friends At the same time I was friends with Ztrip and he went out on the road with LP So they asked us to do a song Both Emoss and my choice of songs to do was Runaway Joe and Mike said Runaway was availible so we just started working on it"

Eric Moss, who was also at the chat, added:

"we added more an electronic feel to it added some things it didnt have before added new flavors they had a bridge that was aggressive we added this hip hop rock break in there with scratches we put in a whole new take on the song and added some drums and hip hop elements chester redid his verses on the song too

mickey who did my december remix ..we're friends with as well. it was a colaboration with backyard bangers we hooked up with mike at mickey's place and phoenix would come in it was a lot of hours but a lot of fun"

About Tate La Rock's involviment in the remix, Troublemaker said: "Tate was really instrumental in the recording process of the remix He used to get us good records to sample he has an awesome record collection Tate is another friend of ours and LP FYI"

The remix samples the song "Nursery Rhyme/Breather" by Unkle.

When questioned if he would have liked to remix another song for the album, Troublemaker said: "Crawling We really liked the electronic beginning on Crawling. The keyboards on Crawling...but the keys in the beginning of Crawling were cool and we knew we could add some phat drums to them I mean Runaway"
