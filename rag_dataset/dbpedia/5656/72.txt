Telefilm Canada is announcing the latest round of funding for 21 feature-length films in English and other languages from the Production Program’s February 2022 submissions, with a total commitment of $12.8 million.

Last month, Telefilm also announced a commitment to eight French-language films in the French market.

After receiving a high volume of 300+ applications this year, an advisory committee of external and internal representatives assessed the projects and made recommendations to Telefilm. The decision-making process considered Telefilm’s goal of fostering a diversity of voices in the industry and ensuring that Telefilm funds a balanced portfolio of productions that reflect a variety of genres, budgets, company sizes, regions and points of view. Names of selection committee members will be published on the Project Financing Advisory Committees webpage once all funding decisions have been made.
