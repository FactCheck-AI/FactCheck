The 'Heart Skips A Beat' singer is seen professing his love for music in the new album teaser clip.

Olly Murs has given fans a chance to see behind the scenes of the making of his new album 'Right Place Right Time' ahead of the record's release next week.

The 'Troublemaker' singer is seen describing the new album as a "step forward" from his previous two albums, as well as saying music has become the "special something" in his life that he wants to do everyday.

"Every album I've had it's been a step forward," Olly says in the first clip. "I think this album has gone into a different direction which is nice because I think I've proven myself as an artist that can do different genres of music."

The two behind the scenes videos also feature interviews with the various songwriters and producers who worked on 'Right Place Right Time', as well as Olly discussing how much he loves being a performer.

"I love what I do. I love performing, I love singing, I love having fun in the studio," Olly explains. "I've done a lot of jobs in my time that I didn't like, and I was looking for that special something in my life.

"Something that was going to really grab me and something I could really get my teeth into and something I loved and wanted to do everyday, and I found it."
