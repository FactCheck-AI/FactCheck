In 1956 Art became a delegate of the Royal Liver Friendly society and quickly established himself as something of a "live wire", never afraid to jump to his feet and voice his opinion. The friendships he forged whilst a delegate were treasured by him even after his election to the Committee of Management in 1963. He was the first Irishman to be elected to the Committee of Management and his delegate colleagues stood on their chairs, waving their order papers exclaiming it a great day for the Irish.

He left the Civil Sservice to move to Royal Liver HQ in Liverpool bringing his beloved wife, Breda, whom he had married in 1961. They had started married life in St Lawrence Road, Clontarf but moved to England and again created a new life, settling in Bromborough, just outside Liverpool. In 1965 their son, Sean was born followed in 1970 by their daughter, Aisling.

Family life was happy with Art's sense of purpose and drive balanced by Breda's calm and loving influence. Together they were a complete and unbeatable team. At every available opportunity the family returned to Ireland to visit family.

Art was a proud Irish speaker who at one time judged Irish verse and poems. Blessed with a keen intellect he was a voracious reader and read until a few days before his death.

He was genuinely interested in people and their lives and enjoyed talking to them. While he was in the Royal Liver he was as relaxed and familiar with all the support staff as he was with the other board members and proud of it. As an Irishman he felt he moved easily through all levels of society in England, met many of the top UK politicians and even had lunch with the Queen.

While he lived in Bromborough the only radio the family listened to was RTE 1. He had an Irish paper every day and three on a Sunday and his sister also sent over the Dundalk papers each week and these were intensively scanned so much that he was generally more aware of events than people living at home.

Art retired from the Royal Liver in 1988. He was the longest continuous serving member of the Committee of Management that century and the longest serving Chairman the society has ever had. He rose to all the challenges in his career both good and bad and never forgot his roots in Ireland. Above all he loved people and their stories. He had a great fondness for Liverpool and all the people he met and experiences he had there.

In retirement he enjoyed long periods in Ireland where he was always reinvigorated by his return. He also travelled abroad with Breda and kept up with all the news and politics in England and Ireland.

Art is survived by his son, Sean, daughter, Aisling, their partners, Sara and Martin and his beautiful grand daughter, Eibhlin. He is also survived by his sisters, Nancy Gernon (Blackrock) and Maeve O'Neill (Blackrock).

When Breda died suddenly in 2004 there is no doubt that the light went out of Art's life and he is also predeceased by his sister, Mona Clarke and brother, Peter who collapsed and died in June 1985 during a cross-country practice run at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx when aged 56.

Art's ashes were taken home to St. Oliver Plunkett Church in Blackrock for Requiem Mass celebrated by Very Rev. O. Brennan P.P. and were interned with those of his wife in Haggardstown cemetery.
