The Porsche 911 GT1 Strassenversion is one of the most remarkable road-legal cars ever produced by the German sports car specialist and a particularly unique example was recently spotted at the Villa d’Este event in Italy.

You have probably heard of the 911 GT1 Strassenversion before. Porsche famously built the car to meet homologation requirements for the 911 GT1 racing car which stipulated it needed to build 20 examples. It did just that, building 20 examples that were equipped with the headlights from a 996-generation 911. However, what you may not know is that a further four examples were built, albeit these ones were based on the 1996 GT1 race car rather than the 1997 model and feature 993-generation headlights.

The one featured at Villa d’Este was one of those exceptionally rare examples and was certainly one of the highlights of the event. It was once owned by Bahraini car collector Khalid Abdul Rahim and continues to rock license plates from Bahrain.

Powering the car is a twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter flat-six pumping out approximately 544 hp, slightly less than the 600 hp mustered up by the racing cars.

This particular prototype is extraordinarily valuable and during the video, is shown cruising around the event at slow speeds. It is even shown driving over planks of woods to drive over grilles on the tarmac used to clear water, proving that while it is technically street legal, actually driving it on public roads would be almost impossible.
