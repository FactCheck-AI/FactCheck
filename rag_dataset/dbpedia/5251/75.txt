There’s no doubt about it: the 911 GT1 EVO is still one of the best looking Porsches ever made and one of the least understood cars from Porsche. This video features not only the famous ‘Playstation’ model, but also the Straßenversion and the actual car that won the 24h of Le Mans in 1998, which is called 911 GT1-98 Le Mans. All of them came powered by a twin-turbo boxer flat-six engine with around 550 horsepower! Only Mclaren F1 GTR Long Tail and Mercedes-Benz CLK GTR could match it in the day.
