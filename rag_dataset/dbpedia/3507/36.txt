“Nina’s Heavenly Delights is a brave piece of filmmaking attempting to fuse nationality, gender and sexuality into a heart-warming tale of acceptance and over-coming adversity. For the mini budget and short five-and-a-half week shoot time, Parmar, has actually created something quite adorable and, at times, visionary.” — Carol Keegan, Film Exposed
