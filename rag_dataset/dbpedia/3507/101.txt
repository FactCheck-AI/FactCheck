More than 300 cast members are needed

A search is on to find more than 300 budding Asian actors for a new film to be set in Glasgow.

Director Pratibha Parmar and production company Raindog are holding open auditions for the feature, to be shot in the spring.

Nina's Heavenly Delights will be a comedy about family ties and Indian food set in a Glasgow restaurant.

There are only a few professional Asian actors in Scotland so a campaign has been launched to find new talent.

Ms Parmar said she was attracted back to Glasgow after filming there in 1990.

"I made a video celebrating the European City of Culture and it was my first visit to Glasgow and I absolutely fell in love with it and the people," she said.

"I decided then that one day I wanted to come back and make a movie here."

Scotland has been used as a location for Bollywood films in the past, but these were mainly produced using crews and actors from India.

Stuart Davis of Raindog said the search for home-grown talent has been extensive.

Mr Davis said: "We fly-posted the west end, the south-side, contacted further education colleges, schools, drama colleges, all the drama departments within schools, cultural offices and district councils right across Scotland."

One role that has still to be filled is for a 14 or 15-year-old Asian girl to play a champion Highland dancer in the film.
