The deal will see the public service broadcaster hold exclusive rights in Norway to the competition, which consists of a series of long-distance skiing races.

First held in 2011, the event features several top teams and has both men’s and women’s standings.

"NRK has been following Visma Ski Classics with great interest and we are happy to have signed this agreement,” said Runar Østmo, head of sports rights for NRK.

“The tour and the sport of long distance skiing have great potential in Norway.

"With its early morning starts it will fit us perfectly and give our audience an attractive and complete experience during the winter weekends.”

The deal will commence at the start of the 2016-2017 season and is currently scheduled to last until 2021.

“NRK is the world’s leading media companies with regards winter sports, and we believe this partnership will be very positive for the future development of Ski Classics,” said David Nilsson, Ski Classics chief executive.

The forthcoming season is scheduled to begin in December 2016, with Norway’s Petter Eliassen and Sweden’s Britta Johansson Norgren starting as the men’s and women’s defending champions, respectively.
