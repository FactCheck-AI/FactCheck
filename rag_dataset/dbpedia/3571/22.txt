The Dutch Ministry of Defense has selected the C-390 Millennium from Brazilian manufacturer Embraer to replace the four C-130H Hercules transport aircraft operated by the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF).

In addition to replacing the Hercules, the fleet will also be increased by one aircraft, with five C-390 transport aircraft. The cost of the order is estimated to be between €1 billion and €2.5 billion ($1.05-$2.6 billion).

The RNLAF is in need of flying hours, as illustrated by the evacuation out of Afghanistan in 2021, Dutch State Secretary Christophe van der Maat explained in a letter to the House of Representatives.

“[The evacuation operations] have underlined the importance of guaranteed availability of transport capacity for the armed forces,” Van der Maat wrote. With an expansion from 2,400 to 4,000 flying hours, units can be supported better and more often.”

The first delivery is expected in 2026. The Dutch C-390M aircraft are also expected to participate in the European Air Transport Command.
