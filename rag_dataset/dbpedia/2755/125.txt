Joker’s Wild includes Season of The Drifter and the start of the second extension in Destiny 2’s Annual Pass. This season will focus on the lore of The Drifter and on Gambit.

Gambit Prime is a new and much more aggressive take on Gambit. This is still a 4v4 activity, however, it only lasts for 1 round. This has Matchmaking.

A teleporter from The Drifter sends players to the Plain of the Nine. The Reckoning is an intense PvE mode where players will take on many challenging enemies. It is separated into 3 Tiers:

Xûr Bounties are replaced with Invitations of the Nine, they are meant to unravel mysteries about who and where the Nine are.

This quest is only available to those who have the Annual Pass. Allegiance Quest will ask you to choose between the Vanguard or the Drifter and progress in the quest from either perspective. This choice is based on your character so you can choose a different side with another character.
