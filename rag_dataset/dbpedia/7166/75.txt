Between 1965 and 1975, the Swedish author duo Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö published ten novels about Police Detective Martin Beck. The suite of novels was named Story of a Crime. It would come to transform crime literature forever.

Maj and Per were ardent communists and a deeply devoted romantic couple. Often the journalists who met them would have a hard time remembering who said what afterwards. They were always together, always in tandem; their sentences would intertwine. To tell the story of Beck and this time in literary history, is thus to also tell the story of an all-encompassing, fervent, and at times stormy love.

The decalogue Story of a Crime created the Swedish crime fiction wonder. It is hard to imagine a Wallander, a Salander, or a Van Veeteren without Martin Beck.
