The two-hourlong Miss USA 2024 competition, hosted by Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' Garcelle Beauvais and E! News presenter Keltie Knight, aired live from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, in which 51 women – one from each state and the District of Columbia -- competed for the coveted title of Miss USA. And when the ballots were tabulated, the crown for the 73nd Miss USA was placed on the head of 22-year-old Miss Michigan Alma Cooper.

After a competition, which featured interviews, evening gowns, swimwear, and more, Cooper was crowned by the reigning Miss USA 2023 Savannah Gankiewicz of Hawaii, who inherited the title in May after Utah’s Noelia Voigt stepped down citing mental health reasons.

“As the daughter of a migrant worker, a proud Afro Latina woman and an officer of the United States Army, I am living the American dream,” Cooper said during the pageant’s Q&A section. “If there’s anything that my life and my mother have taught me, it’s that your circumstances never define your destiny: You can make success accessible through demanding excellence.”

Cooper, a US Army officer, who has a master’s in data science from Stanford University, will go on to represent the United States in the 2024 Miss Universe Pageant, which will take place in November in Mexico.

The final five also included:

First runner-up: Miss Kentucky Connor Perry

Second runner-up: Miss Oklahoma Danika Christopherson

Third runner-up: Miss Tennessee Christell Foote

Fourth runner-up: Miss Ohio Macy Hudson

This year’s judging panel included Scheana Shay, star of Bravo’s Vanderpump Rules; Anastasia Soare, CEO of Anastasia Beverly Hills; Gavin DeGraw, singer of the One Tree Hill theme song; shoe designer Jojo Bragais; Carole Gist, winner of Miss USA 1990; and Lu Parker, winner of Miss USA 1994, among others.

A new rule this year allowed women who are 28 years old and over to participate, which means this year's Miss Arizona K Johnson is the oldest woman to ever compete for the title at age 41. Previously the age restrictions were 18 to below 28.

The pageant was held at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles and televised for the second year on The CW.
