The Western Harbour Tunnel will form a direct connection between Rozelle in Sydney’s inner west and North Sydney, creating a link from Sydney’s newly tunnelled WestConnex motorway network to Sydney’s north. The Western Harbour Tunnel will take pressure off the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Anzac Bridge and Western Distributor corridors to improve transport capacity in and around the city.

Western Harbour Tunnel Package 2 has now been awarded to ACCIONA Construction Australia. ACCIONA will construct the motorway tunnels beneath Sydney Harbour through to North Sydney and complete the full mechanical and electrical fit out of the motorway.

This project continues SMEC’s involvement as the Independent Certifier/Verifier on critical infrastructure in Sydney, including on Sydney Gateway, M6 Stage 1 and Warringah Freeway upgrade.

SMEC Australia CEO James Phillis said “We are excited to partner with The APP Group in the delivery of Independent Certifier services for Western Harbour Tunnel Package 2. This role builds on our extensive track record as a provider of Independent Certification services on major infrastructure projects and will facilitate improved transport connections and safety benefits for our community. We look forward to working with TfNSW and our partner on this transformational project that will change the way people move and connect”.

This project forms part of the NSW Government’s vision for an integrated road network that supports the growth of communities, places, and the economy, as well as enabling people and good to move safely and reliably around the city and beyond.
