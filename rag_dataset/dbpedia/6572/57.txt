After a traumatic event, Roy and Denise's family moves to a farm in North Dakota. But the peace they seek there is cruelly disturbed when their 16-year-old daughter Jess and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see ghostly shadows in the old farmhouse. They emerge from dark corners. Because no one except the children sees these dark shapes, her parents begin to doubt her sanity. But Jess knows these ghosts are real. And they are getting more dangerous by the dayâ€¦ What do these deadly visitors want? Danny and Oxide Pang, creators of the chilling The Eye, made The Messengers, their first American horror film, under the supervision of producer Sam Raimi, (Evil Dead, Spider-Man). The result is a thrilling film that combines the best of Asian and American horror. Picture: High Definition 16:9 Sound: Dolby Digital 5.1 Language: English Subtitles: Dutch
