The Official Gazette of the Canary Islands publishes this Thursday the resolution of the Ministry of Education, Universities, Culture and Sports by which the catalog of Francoist vestiges of the Canary Islandswhich initially sticks to those of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, where 79 are identified and the removal of the monument to Franco is recommended.

It lists monuments, sculptures, objects, shields, inscriptions and tombstones, street names, urban spaces and honors and distinctions (medals, adopted children, favorite children) related to people who participated in the military uprising, the Civil War and the repression of the dictatorship.

Among them are military coup leaders, soldiers, volunteers and deceased in the Civil War, volunteers from July 18 and later, provisional lieutenants and provisional sergeants, political posts in the period of exception and later, ideologues, propagandists and iconographers of the regime and civilian collaborators. .

The catalog includes a series of recommendations, including the removal of the sculptural group from the monument to Franco, both the base, “symbol of Tenerife’s contribution to the military uprising”, the figure of the archangel, symbolizing Franco’s flight to start the war in the ‘Dragon rapide’ plane, and the allegorical figure of the general over the archangel represented as an athletic young man dressed in a tunic that alludes to the national flag and presents a sword in front that is identified as a cross.

It also proposes the removal of the shields located at the top of the 9 pillars that are distributed on the rear wall that serves as a frame for the complex and in which the cascading fountain is installed, the allegorical shields to the 9 judicial districts of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in 1960 and which represent “the claim to signify the recognition of the military uprising and the Civil War as a just and legal cause”.

In other cases, the withdrawal of plaques and honors is proposed, or a contextualization process that eliminates all reminiscences of praise to Francoism in elements that can be safeguarded.
