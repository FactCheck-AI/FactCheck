BACK TO THE SECRET GARDEN is a charming mix of magical realism and mystery set in 1946 Yorkshire, England. The characters are very much of their time -- prim, proper, yet inclined to mischief -- and fully drawn and developed. The acting -- from the largest to the smallest roles -- is excellent. The story is engaging, and stands among the best of English children's stories.

Even if you haven't seen the 1993 film The Secret Garden (of which this is a sequel), Back to the Secret Garden stands on its own. Parents and kids alike will find much to enjoy in this film.
