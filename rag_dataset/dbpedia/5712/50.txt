What is cross contamination?

Cross contamination occurs when one object becomes contaminated by either direct or indirect contact with another object which is already contaminated.

Why is cross contamination a problem?

Cross contamination can cause food poisoning when bacteria is transferred onto food that is ready to eat. For example, if raw meat comes into contact with a sandwich, the person eating the sandwich will consume the bacteria that was on the raw meat.

How does cross contamination occur?

Common activities that result in cross contamination include:

using the same knife or chopping board to cut both raw and ready-to-eat foods

using the handwash basin for defrosting food or placing dirty utensils and equipment

storing food uncovered or on the floor of the fridge or freezer

storing raw food above ready-to-eat food

re-using cloths to wipe benches, cutlery and tables

using a towel to dry hands which is then used for drying equipment, utensils or dishes.
