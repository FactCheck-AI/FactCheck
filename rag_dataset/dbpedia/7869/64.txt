Mark Lanegan will release his first album under the Mark Lanegan Band banner since 2004 early next year.

‘Blues Funeral‘ will be released through 4AD on February 6th 2012, and will feature a cameo from his former Queens Of The Stone Age bandmate Josh Homme.

The new album follows 2004’s ‘Bubblegum‘, which also featured a range of guest musicians including Duff McKagan and PJ Harvey. Last year, he released his third record, ‘Hawk‘, with Isobel Campbell, which received unanimous praise from critics for its classic, melody-heavy songwriting.

The Mark Lanegan Band will tour ‘Blues Funeral’ in March next year, beginning at the Bristol Academy on March 4th. Two Irish dates, in Dublin and Belfast, will follow on the 7th and 8th, with a final gig coming at the Shepherds Bush Empire on March 13th.
