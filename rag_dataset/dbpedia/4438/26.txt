Umicore SA is projecting two more years of losses at its battery materials division as automakers delay orders amid a sharp slowdown in demand for electric vehicles.

The unit, which is walking back its expansion plans, is recording a â‚¬1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) impairment, Umicore said Friday. The business sees operating losses next year and in 2026, with positive returns expected only in the last years of this decade.
