McEnroe was at the height of his career around the 1984 Grand Slam tournament at Roland Garros, and the mix of interviews and archival footage goes deep into the mind of one of the sport’s most cerebral minds.

#44. The Class of '92 (2013)

- Directors: Benjamin Turner, Gabe Turner

- Stacker score: 82.3

- Metascore: data not available

- IMDb user rating: 8.0

- Runtime: 99 minutes

Director Benjamin Turner understood well that if you’re going to focus on a documentary on someone, they should be hard to take your eyes off when they are on screen. "The Class of '92" tells the story of a young, ultra-talented class of Manchester United soccer players who came to prominence together from 1992 to 1997. Five of those players (Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, and Phil and Gary Neville) are fascinating and fantastic talents—the sixth, a young David Beckham, makes the film a captivating watch. The story focuses on the exploits on the pitch, but also gets into the relationships between the young stars, which elevates it as a film.

#43. Beyond the Mat (1999)

- Director: Barry W. Blaustein

- Stacker score: 82.3

- Metascore: 73

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

- Runtime: 102 minutes

Though it has the unfortunate uncinematic look of a late ’90s documentary, "Beyond the Mat" offers an interesting window into the day-to-day lives of pro wrestlers. Director Barry W. Blaustein follows wrestlers at different stages of their careers—current star Mick Foley, recent retiree Terry Funk, and washed-up legend Jake “The Snake” Roberts—to show the highs and the costs of the lifestyle. Foley is the standout of the film, and it’s fascinating to see the intricacies and the toll of his brand of gross-out, extreme wrestling. The film did a lot to demonstrate that though the storylines are written, wrestling is not play-fighting—these are real athletes with real injuries and exceptional tolerances for pain.

#42. The Heart of the Game (2005)

- Director: Ward Serrill

- Stacker score: 82.3

- Metascore: 74

- IMDb user rating: 7.5

- Runtime: 97 minutes

Director Ward Serrill’s documentary focuses upon an unlikely Seattle girls' high school basketball team’s run for a state championship and their run-in with the state’s bureaucracy. The film follows a University of Washington professor with no experience who volunteers to coach the high school team and implements a play-hard, always-press mentality that works. It also focuses on the team’s standout star, Darnellia Russell, who drops out to have a child and must fight to get her eligibility back when she returns to school to graduate. In 2014, Russell was named head coach of Shoreline Community College after playing and coaching at North Seattle Community College.

#41. Next Goal Wins (2014)

- Directors: Mike Brett, Steve Jamison

- Stacker score: 82.9

- Metascore: 71

- IMDb user rating: 7.9

- Runtime: 97 minutes

Director Mike Brett's documentary follows American Samoa's quixotic quest to qualify for the 2014 World Cup. The action starts with a humiliating and record-breaking 31-0 loss to Australia in 2001. From there, we see Dutch-born and American-based coach Thomas Rongen arrive to a team he explains as "the lowest standard." Throughout the film, the team learns under Rongen and finally has a chance to play for the right to go to Brazil. Brett's film is somewhat about soccer, but just as much about the struggle to make it and what it means for a tiny island to find pride through sport.

#40. Harry & Snowman (2015)

- Director: Ron Davis

- Stacker score: 82.9

- Metascore: 74

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

- Runtime: 84 minutes

“Harry & Snowman” recounts Harry deLeyer’s story of turning a scrawny pony into a champion thoroughbred. DeLeyer later got involved in show jumping, but delights in retelling this Cinderella story in a film that has major Seabiscuit vibes.

#39. This Ain't California (2012)

- Director: Marten Persiel

- Stacker score: 82.9

- Metascore: 76

- IMDb user rating: 7.4

- Runtime: 100 minutes

Based in the “mockumentary” genre, “This Ain’t California” tells an engrossing story of East German skateboarders. Controversy arose after the film’s release about how much was real and fiction in the documentary, but the skating shots are likely to delight any fan of ollies and grinding.

- IMDb user rating: 7.4

- Director: Curt Morgan

- Stacker score: 83.4

- Metascore: data not available

- IMDb user rating: 8.2

- Runtime: 80 minutes

Director Curt Morgan’s film follows snowboarder Travis Rice and his friends as they take on some of the most remote, extreme peaks around the world. The film elevates itself slightly above an extended snowboard video because the cinematography is jaw-dropping, and Morgan spends some time on the logistics of finding and deploying upon the unridden mountainsides.

#36. McConkey (2013)

- Directors: Rob Bruce, Scott Gaffney, Murray Wais, Steve Winter, David Zieff

- Stacker score: 83.4

- Metascore: 68

- IMDb user rating: 8.3

- Runtime: 100 minutes

"McConkey" tells the life story of legendary skier and extreme athlete Shane McConkey. The film touches on McConkey's father—himself a skiing legend who was absent from his son's life—as well as the many risks that Shane took while changing the entire sport of extreme skiing and BASE jumping. We see McConkey reach the top of his sport, win awards, put out highly regarded extreme skiing films, and start a family, and then cringe as we approach the inevitable end—he died during a ski-BASE jump in Italy in 2009.

#35. The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg (1998)

- Director: Aviva Kempner

- Stacker score: 83.4

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

#34. Harvard Beats Yale 29-29 (2008)

- Director: Kevin Rafferty

- Stacker score: 83.4

- Metascore: 79

- IMDb user rating: 7.2

- Runtime: 105 minutes

The 1968 Harvard-Yale football game is well-known for its dramatic action, but also for the headline in The Harvard Crimson that serves as this documentary’s title. Among the interviewees in the flick is Tommy Lee Jones, who was a lineman for Harvard. We won’t spoil the ending (the title might give you a hint), but the voyage there is well worth the wait.

#33. On the Ropes (1999)

- Directors: Nanette Burstein, Brett Morgen

- Stacker score: 83.4

- Metascore: 80

- IMDb user rating: 7.1

- Runtime: 94 minutes

Boxing is a sport filmmakers seem to naturally gravitate to for its brute force, intensity, and dedication. “On the Ropes” follows young boxers aiming for glory while trying to duck uppercuts and the pull of the streets. Trainer Harry Keitt stars as a patriarchal figure in a documentary that resembles the seminal hit “Hoop Dreams.”

#32. Wrestle (2018)

- Directors: Suzannah Herbert, Lauren Belfer

- Stacker score: 84

- Metascore: 82

- IMDb user rating: 7.0

- Runtime: 96 minutes

- Stacker score: 84.5

- Metascore: 69

- IMDb user rating: 8.4

- Runtime: 89 minutes

Director Marius A. Markevicius brings the incredible, unlikely story of a team recently out from under the Iron Curtain, wearing tie-dyed jerseys and winning a bronze medal at the Barcelona games, into sharp focus. The film manages to be both meaningful and fun, and it's endlessly entertaining to watch Lithuanian stars Arvydas Sabonis and Sarunas Marciulionis.

#30. On Any Sunday (1971)

- Director: Bruce Brown

- Stacker score: 84.5

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 7.8

- Runtime: 96 minutes

Like "Road," Bruce Brown’s "On Any Sunday" follows the wild subculture of motorcycle racers. Much less specific than the film about the North Irish stars of road racing, Brown’s film follows many different racers—including the actor Steve McQueen—and tries to understand why they risk it all for the sport. Brown made this film five years after "Endless Summer," and it’s clear he feels a similar admiration for these motorcyclists that he does for surfers. The film is much less beautiful than "Endless Summer," but the look of the 1970 racers makes it absolutely great to watch.

#29. Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001)

- Director: Stacy Peralta

- Stacker score: 84.5

- Metascore: 76

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 91 minutes

In the same way that 1960s and 1970s France makes any bike-racing documentary a dream to watch, 1970s Venice Beach, California has a similar effect when it comes to skateboarding. In "Dogtown and Z-Boys," director Stacy Peralta (himself one of the Z-Boys) tells the story of Zephyr skateboarding team, and how surf culture influenced their groundbreaking skating style. The film, narrated by Sean Penn, is an incredibly fun watch, and Peralta does a pretty good job of taking on the grimmer details as they arrive for some of his fellow Z-Boys later in life. This is skating documentary, but feels a bit like a rock ’n’ roll documentary as well—sex, drugs, and skating in empty pools.

#28. Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee (1969)

- Director: William Klein

- Stacker score: 84.5

- Metascore: 77

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

- Runtime: 94 minutes

In 1969, during the years Muhammad Ali was kept from fighting for his refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War, director William Klein put out "Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee," a sometimes artsy, always enlightening look at the young, boisterous, incredibly magnetic heavyweight champ. Klein shot an extra section about his 1974 fight against George Foreman in Zaire, and released the updated film as "Muhammad Ali, The Greatest." Klein is best known for his fashion photography for Vogue—and it shows in how beautifully the film was shot.

#27. Meru (2015)

- Directors: Jimmy Chin, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi

- Stacker score: 85.1

- Metascore: 77

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 90 minutes

This documentary is one of the best of the mountain-climbing doc genre (which is saying a lot). In "Meru," we follow three elite climbers (with many Everest summits between them) taking on an absolutely deadly big wall climb in the Himalayas. The footage throughout "Meru" is mesmerizing and the climbers, overcome with fear and fatigue, speak eloquently and honestly about death and obsession and the cost of trying to conquer a mountain. Author Jon Krakauer, whose book "Into Thin Air" is the best mountain climbing story ever written, guides the narrative as a talking head throughout.

#26. Sachin - A Billion Dreams (2017)

#25. The Battered B***ards of Baseball (2014)

- Directors: Chapman Way, Maclain Way

- Stacker score: 85.6

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 8.0

- Runtime: 80 minutes

Brother directors Chapman and Maclain Way uncovered the wonderful true story of the Portland Mavericks, a 1970s independent baseball team dreamed up by actor Bing Russell that tried everything (open tryouts, the first woman general manager, signing shunned reliever Jim Bouton, and more) and turned into one of the most beloved, if short-lived, teams in history. Bing Russell is Kurt Russell’s dad, and Kurt played for the Mavericks during the 1970s. It’s incredible to watch the young man who would one day portray Jack Burton play a damn good second base. Today, the Way brothers are better known for their fantastic documentary mini-series "Wild Wild Country," released in 2018.

#24. Diego Maradona (2019)

- Director: Asif Kapadia

- Stacker score: 85.6

- Metascore: 78

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 130 minutes

This documentary separates itself from Kusturica’s film with its focus on the 1980s and Maradona’s club soccer career. Kapadia, the director, excellently differentiates between the private and public lives of Maradona, who was one of the world’s most famous athletes.

#23. Nossa Chape (2018)

- Directors: Jeff Zimbalist, Michael Zimbalist, Julián Camilo Duque

- Stacker score: 85.6

- Metascore: 80

- IMDb user rating: 7.5

- Runtime: 101 minutes

After losing the heart of its team in a plane crash, Brazil’s Chapecoense football club seeks to rebuild in “Nossa Chape.” The Zimbalist brothers previously directed “The Two Escobars,” another soccer documentary, and delivered again with a touching look at a community heartbroken and looking to heal.

#22. TT3D: Closer to the Edge (2011)

- Director: Richard De Aragues

- Stacker score: 86.2

- Metascore: 76

- IMDb user rating: 8.0

- Runtime: 104 minutes

First-time director Richard De Aragues tells the story of the runup to 2010 Isle of Man motorcycle road race. The film, shot in 3D and narrated by Jared Leto, focuses on John McGuinness, Guy Martin, Ian Hutchinson, and other competitors as they take on one of the most dangerous and unique races on Earth. The film does a little dive into the racers’ interior lives, but it's mainly about the fun of watching motorcycle road racing in 3D.

#21. Bigger Stronger Faster* (2008)

- Director: Chris Bell

- Stacker score: 86.2

- Metascore: 80

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

- Runtime: 105 minutes

Director Chris Bell's fast-paced documentary takes on the history of performance enhancing drugs in sports by zooming in on how his two brothers began to take steroids to chase their big-league dreams. Arriving in 2008, on the heels of Major League Baseball's steroid controversy and congressional hearings/involvement in cleaning up sports, the documentary does a great job looking at the roots of the issue and the hypocrisy of how the controversy has been dealt with. The story of the Bell brothers is interesting, but the archival footage (featuring the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, George W. Bush, and 1960s Olympians) is the real star.

#20. The Russian Five (2018)

- Director: Joshua Riehl

- Stacker score: 86.7

- Metascore: 75

- IMDb user rating: 8.2

- Runtime: 102 minutes

In the 1980s, the Detroit Red Wings began their climb out of hockey’s basement by turning to Russia. With the Iron Curtain down, National Hockey League teams began scouring the former U.S.S.R. for talent, and the Red Wings struck gold with five Russian stars. More than just a sports story, “The Russian Five” also delves into Cold War politics and the hardships of immigration after the war.

#19. Rising Phoenix (2020)

- Directors: Ian Bonhôte, Peter Ettedgui

- Stacker score: 86.7

- Metascore: 76

- IMDb user rating: 8.1

- Runtime: 105 minutes

Nine paralympic athletes star in “Rising Phoenix” with stories of determination, sadness, and success. Their physical prowess is stunning and they prove throughout the duration of the film that they are among the best athletes in the world. Much of the film takes place at the 2012 Paralympics in London, but the directors also give an extensive history lesson on the hurdles paralympic athletes have faced over the years.

#18. Deep Water (2006)

- Directors: Louise Osmond, Jerry Rothwell

- Stacker score: 87.3

- Metascore: 80

- IMDb user rating: 7.8

- Runtime: 92 minutes

In 1968, a round-the-world solo yacht race was held. Most of the sailors were the best in the world, but one was a novice who’d bet everything on the event. Louise Osmond’s film tells the story of that racer, Donald Crowhurst, who risked his life as he took an unfit boat (and skill set) into the most treacherous boat race in history, all to avoid financial ruin. The film is gorgeous and tragic, telling an overlooked story with archival footage and interviews with family members and participants.

#17. Tyson (2008)

- Director: James Toback

- Stacker score: 87.3

- Metascore: 83

- IMDb user rating: 7.5

- Runtime: 90 minutes

For a period in the 1980s, Mike Tyson was the most feared and most famous athlete on Earth. Fleet-footed, ferocious, and completely unpredictable, every Tyson fight was must-see entertainment—though many were so short you’d miss them if you blinked. For 2008’s "Tyson," director James Toback managed to get an older, retrospective Tyson to go deep on his life, mixing his insights with incredible archival footage.

#16. Riding Giants (2004)

- Director: Stacy Peralta

- Stacker score: 87.8

- Metascore: 80

- IMDb user rating: 7.9

- Runtime: 105 minutes

Director Stacy Peralta, who put out the legendary skate documentary "Dogtown and Z-Boys," tells the story of the big wave surfing world in the beautiful and epic "Riding Giants." Using archival footage to tell the sport's history and then spending time focusing on the founder of the Mavericks Surf Contest and standout star Laird Hamilton, Peralta gives a compelling survey of a strange and dangerous passion. Hearing about monster waves is one thing, but Peralta's ability to capture the surfers on top of the 50-foot waves is jaw-dropping.

#15. Maiden (2018)

- Director: Alex Holmes

- Stacker score: 87.8

- Metascore: 82

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 97 minutes

#14. Red Army (2014)

- Director: Gabe Polsky

- Stacker score: 87.8

- Metascore: 83

- IMDb user rating: 7.6

- Runtime: 84 minutes

In sports, it’s tempting to dehumanize the opponent, but in reality, they're still people—with stories, fears, and interior lives on both sides of every game. Gabe Polsky’s documentary looks at the Soviet Union’s "Red Army" hockey team, a fearsome, unbeatable force that would become the perfect foil for the "Miracle On Ice" American squad. But Polsky looks deeper at men behind the caricature and the glory they gained and cost they paid to be one of the Soviet Union’s greatest exports.

#13. One Day in September (1999)

- Director: Kevin Macdonald

- Stacker score: 88.4

- Metascore: 82

- IMDb user rating: 7.8

- Runtime: 94 minutes

Director Kevin Macdonald’s film tells the terrifying story of the 1972 Munich Olympics, where a Palestinian terrorist organization took a group of Israeli athletes hostage. The documentary chronicles the botched response by the German police and supplements its incredible archival footage with an interview with the last surviving terrorist. Six years later, "Munich" would tell the same story as a feature film. "One Day in September" won the Academy Award for Best Documentary.

#12. The Crash Reel (2013)

- Director: Lucy Walker

- Stacker score: 89

- Metascore: 79

- IMDb user rating: 8.2

- Runtime: 108 minutes

The world of competitive snowboarding is a relatively small one, and this documentary takes us through 15 years of footage charting the rise of Shaun White and Kevin Pearce, two childhood best friends who became the best two snowboarders on the planet. The story builds toward the Vancouver Olympics—soon before the event, Pearce gets seriously injured in a half-pipe and is recovering as White wins the gold. The film is a beautifully intimate look (much of the archival footage is taken with handheld cameras) at a friendship—and what happens when a terrible injury makes paths diverge.

#11. The Dawn Wall (2017)

- Stacker score: 89.5

- IMDb user rating: 8.1

- IMDb user rating: 8.0

- Runtime: 106 minutes

Based on the book by climber Joe Simpson, "Touching the Void" tells the incredible, haunting story of Simpson and Simon Yates’ unprecedented ascent and unbelievable descent of Siula Grande in Peru. Simpson breaks his leg on the way down the west face; Yates works to get him back to basecamp by letting out 30 feet of slack and then climbing down to him. But when Simpson is let off a ledge and unable to climb his way back, Yates makes the decision to cut him loose. The documentary recounts the unbelievable story of how Simpson made it back, and wrestles with the way the men must deal with Yates’ decision.

- Directors: Bonni Cohen, Jon Shenk

- Stacker score: 89.5

- Metascore: 85

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 103 minutes

“Athlete A” follows the journalists who broke the story of Larry Nassar’s repeated abuse of female gymnasts. There are many intriguing stories at play—of the journalists, the athletes, and their families. For as heartbreaking as it is to listen to recounts of the crimes Nassar committed, the work of the investigative reporters and strength of the athletes in telling their story are worth the watch.

#8. When We Were Kings (1996)

- Director: Leon Gast

- Stacker score: 90.1

- Metascore: 83

- IMDb user rating: 8.0

- Runtime: 88 minutes

Arguably the greatest Muhammad Ali documentary, director Leon Gast’s "When We Were Kings" focuses on “The Rumble in the Jungle”—the heavyweight title bout in Zaire between Ali and George Foreman. The archival footage in this documentary is jaw-dropping—Zaire is awash in color, Ali is beautifully handsome, Foreman is terrifyingly strong, and Don King is an absolute trip. The most memorable scenes are Foreman hitting the heavy bag and leaving a divot the size of a watermelon where his fist hits, and Ali running through Zaire, trailed by a group of children, screaming, “Ali bomaye! Ali bomaye! [Ali, kill him!].” The film has the most ridiculous cast of talking heads, including an exceptionally animated Norman Mailer. "When We Were Kings" won Best Documentary at the Academy Awards in 1997.

#7. Senna (2010)

- Director: Asif Kapadia

- Stacker score: 90.6

- Metascore: 79

- IMDb user rating: 8.5

- Runtime: 106 minutes

Director Asif Kapadia, who won the Oscar for 2015’s "Amy," tells the beautiful, heartbreaking story of Brazilian Formula 1 champion Ayrton Senna, who died tragically at the age of 34. Senna was a handsome, magnetic character, and the world of late ’80s, early ’90s Formula 1 racing is a fun one to get lost in for a while. "Senna" is fast-paced, but never forgets to take into account the interior life of the driver—and what he leaves behind when his luck on the track runs out.

#6. The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters (2007)

- Director: Seth Gordon

- Stacker score: 90.6

- Metascore: 83

- IMDb user rating: 8.1

- Runtime: 79 minutes

This incredible documentary about the world of competitive arcade gaming has no business working as well as it does. But director Seth Gordon finds incredibly odd and magnetic characters and takes on the world with respect, even while allowing space for the viewer to laugh at the insanity of it all. The film focuses on the David vs. Goliath battle between soft-spoken, unassuming teacher Steve Wiebe and over-the-top powerhouse Billy Mitchell for the world record high score in "Donkey Kong." In 2018, Mitchell was found to have cheated in attaining his high score and had all of his marks stripped from the record books.

#5. Murderball (2005)

- Directors: Henry Alex Rubin, Dana Adam Shapiro

- Stacker score: 90.6

- Metascore: 87

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 88 minutes

Henry Alex Rubin’s "Murderball" follows the full-contact quadriplegic rugby teams as they go to compete in the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens. The sport itself is wonderfully extreme, and Rubin’s film does not shy away from any parts of the competitors lives: we see the physical and emotional pain of dealing with their injuries, the difficulty with their sex lives, the interpersonal issues of the team, and also their competitive drive. It’s a movie that works because it shows a world we rarely see, with all its greatness and its warts—it’s a powerful film and the sport itself is wild to watch on screen.

#4. Free Solo (2018)

- Directors: Jimmy Chin, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi

- Stacker score: 91.2

- Metascore: 83

- IMDb user rating: 8.2

- Runtime: 100 minutes

The third documentary on this list to feature El Capitan, “Free Solo” is perhaps the most well-known for its story centering on climber Alex Honnold. “Free Solo” is anchored by the charm of Honnold, and proved to be a rare box office and mainstream success for a movie about climbing. The cherry on top came when “Free Solo” won the Oscar for Best Documentary Film.

#3. Over the Limit (2017)

- Director: Marta Prus

- Stacker score: 91.2

- Metascore: 91

- IMDb user rating: 7.4

- Runtime: 74 minutes

Great sports stories don’t only come on the gridiron or diamond. Margarita Mamun, a rhythmic gymnast from Russia, trains for the 2016 Olympics in “Over the Limit,” a film that drew comparisons to Darren Aronofsky’s “Black Swan.” Director Marta Prus was a rhythmic gymnast and used that knowledge to capture the intensity of the sport like no one before her.

#2. Man on Wire (2008)

- Director: James Marsh

- Stacker score: 91.7

- Metascore: 89

- IMDb user rating: 7.7

- Runtime: 94 minutes

Even for viewers afraid of heights, “Man of Wire” is a stunning look at Philippe Petit's high-wire walk between the Twin Towers in lower Manhattan. Petit’s act was illegal, and so the documentary contains drama like a high-speed chase, but with crafty, elegant shots, too, particularly through never-before-seen footage of the walk. The film won the Oscar for Best Documentary Feature.

#1. Hoop Dreams (1994)

- Director: Steve James

- Stacker score: 100

- Metascore: 98

- IMDb user rating: 8.3

- Runtime: 170 minutes

One of the truly classics of the sports doc genre, Steve James's "Hoop Dreams" follows William Gates and Arthur Agee, two Chicago teens trying to make it to the NBA. James spent years with Gates and Agee, telling their parallel stories of hype, disappointment, triumph, and survival—Roger Ebert ranked "Hoop Dreams" as the best film of the 1990s. Neither Gates nor Agee made it to the NBA (or even especially close), but the film offers a window into the world of amateur basketball and what it's like to believe that basketball is one's way out of bad circumstances.
