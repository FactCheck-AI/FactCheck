Donald Reno MacNary of St. Petersburg, Florida, died on January 9, 2024, after a short illness. He was 93 years old.

Don was born February 2, 1930, in Quincy, Massachusetts, to Hazel Reno MacNary and Burton Glenn MacNary. Don grew up in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, and Plandome, New York. He rowed crew for and graduated from Yale University in 1952. Don served in the Navy from 1952–54 on the amphibious ship USS New Kent, 217. He was first an Ensign then LTJG in the roles of Officer of the Deck Underway, Boat Landing Officer, Assistant Navigator, Signal Officer, and Quartermaster Division Officer.

Don and Ellen Reynolds Medart were married in her hometown of St. Louis, MO, on October 10, 1959. They share three children: Reynolds Reno MacNary of Austin, TX; Timothy Glenn MacNary of Bellevue, WA; and Ann MacNary Shafer of Baltimore, MD.

Following first wife Ellen’s death from cancer in 1977, Don married Julie Camp Wright in 1985 and embarked on a long and loving marriage.

Initially in Boston, MA, then in Rye, NY, Don worked for Continental Baking Company’s Morton Frozen Foods division (1962–70). That company’s purchase by ITT took the young MacNary family to Brussels, Belgium, for a year and a half (1970–72). Following a year commuting to the Pearson Candy Company in Minneapolis, MN, (1972–73), Don quit the corporate world and joined good friend and partner Jim Gillespie at Gillespie Associates in Westport, CT. His work as a career counselor and business consultant was deeply satisfying. It was from Gillespie Associates that Don retired in 1989 and with Julie moved to North Falmouth, MA, to be near his aging parents, the water, and boatyards.

A lifelong sailor, Don loved each of the sailboats on which he was first mate and/or captain: the Victory named Alouette, the Atlantic named Ann, the International named Annie, the Concordia Yawl named Westray, and the Camper Nicholson named Skye. Retirement to Cape Cod was ideal. Don and Julie particularly enjoyed offshore sailing to the Caribbean for several consecutive winters on Skye.

Don and Julie were adventurous on land, too, and they traveled extensively. They were long-term members of the Unitarian Church in Falmouth, MA, until their permanent move to St. Petersburg, FL, in 2003. They have been residents at Westminster Suncoast for many years and found there a wonderful community of friends and colleagues.

Don was insatiably curious, strived to genuinely connect with everyone he met, loved to poke holes in a person’s pretentions, and was an infuriatingly circular arguer. He loved deeply, felt deeply, lived deeply. Don rarely missed cocktail hour and loved good food. He also loved classical music, particularly featuring human voices united in intricate harmonies. It was to a selection of his favorite choral works that he passed away peacefully. His delivery of long, involved, and funny jokes was legendary as was his deep love for each of his dogs (Springer Spaniels Punch, MacDuff, Angus, and Milo, and Collie/Lab mix MacGillicuddy).

Don was filled with pride in and love for his children and grandchildren. He is survived by his wife Julie MacNary and his children: son Ren MacNary and daughter-in-law Florence MacNary, son Tim MacNary (daughter-in-law Deborah MacNary pre-deceased him), and daughter Ann Shafer and son-in-law Christopher Shafer. His grandchildren Lauren MacNary, Elizabeth (Lizzie) MacNary, Timothy (Timmie) MacNary, Ellen MacNary, Catherine (Katie) MacNary, Alexander (Alex) Shafer, and Wyatt Shafer will miss their PapaDon immensely. Don will also be missed by his extended family, Julie’s children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren.

Don was a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend. His collective family remains grateful for his long and full life.
