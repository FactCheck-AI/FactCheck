University of the East – UE

University of the East – UE is one of the most prestigious educational institutions in the Philippines. The University of the East has its campuses at Manila and Caloocan.

The university was founded in the year 1946 by Dr. Francisco T. Dalupan Sr. as a review classes for 110 students enrolled in Certified Public Accountant (CPA). Out of these 110 students, four students made it to top places in the CPA board examinations in 1947.
