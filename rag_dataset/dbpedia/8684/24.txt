Behind the scenes[]

Colleen hated to wear a corset and her least favourite outfit in Anne of Green Gables was the green outfit when Marilla tells Matthew that they can't keep Anne.

Another fun fact from the first movie is that the lines "I'll forgive you if you forgive me" and "twenty pounds of brown sugar" was improvised.

Colleen was unavailable at the time of filming so Trudy Grant was used as a stand-in during the drive back to the orphanage. Grant was part of the production staff in Anne of Green Gables and the executive producer for later Sullivan adaptations.

Colleen was ill with food poisoning when they shot the scene in Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel where Marilla and Anne discusses Diana's engagement.
