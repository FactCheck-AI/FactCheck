The Sundance Film Festival won't kick off til January, but we already have the first look at what's bound to be one of the most disturbing films to come out of the festival. In The Invisible War, This Film is Not Yet Rated and Outrage director Kirby Dick has turned his talents as a documentarian to the underreported epidemic of rape in the military. The subject matter all but guarantees this film will be a tough one to watch, but if Dick's previous work is anything to go by, it's bound to be a powerful and important one as well. Watch the trailer after the jump.

It goes without saying that even one rape is a tragedy, just as any one death would be, but the most chilling statistic Dick offers in this trailer is that "Military women are more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire." Something is seriously amiss when soldiers need to fear their comrades as much as they do their enemies, but works like The Invisible War are a step in the right direction.

Synopsis:

THE INVISIBLE WAR is a groundbreaking investigative documentary about one of our country's most shameful and best kept secrets: the epidemic of rape within our US military. Today, a female soldier in Iraq and Afghanistan is more likely to be raped by a fellow soldier than killed by enemy fire with the number of assaults in the last decade alone in the hundreds of thousands.

Focusing on the powerfully emotional stories of several young women, the film reveals the systemic cover up of the crimes against them and follows their struggles to rebuild their lives and fight for justice. THE INVISIBLE WAR features hard-hitting interviews with high-ranking military officials and members of Congress that reveal the perfect storm conditions that exist for rape in the military, its history of cover-up, and what can be done to bring about much needed change.
