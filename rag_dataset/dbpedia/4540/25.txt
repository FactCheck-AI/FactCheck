05/29/2003: Tom Jones immortalized himself in the Munich Olympic Park.

The "Tiger" Tom Jones (actually Thomas Jones Woodward) was born on 7 June 1940 in Pontypridd/Glamorgan, a small mining town in South Wales, as the son of a miner.

Many years have passed since then and the mining son can look back on an exceptional world carreer. He stormed the hit parades back in the 60s and celebrated a brilliant comeback in 2000.

In the last few years the Tiger has filled the Olympic hall repeatedly and he was immortalized in the Munich Olympic Walk of Stars on the occasion of his last concert for the time being in May 2003.
