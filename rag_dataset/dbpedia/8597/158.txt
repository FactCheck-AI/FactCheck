Former Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given has criticised Pep Guardiola for his handling of Joe Hart.

The Manchester City boss jettisoned England international Hart in the summer transfer window, with the ex-Birmingham City goalkeeper heading to Torino in Serie A.

Hart made 36 appearances for the Blues on loan in the 2009-10 season.

But former Barcelona boss Guardiola opted to bring in Claudio Bravo from his former club, after telling Hart he was surplus to requirements.

Given remains unconvinced of the Chilean international's ability, though.

“I think we’ll be talking about Bravo all season because it was a big decision to get rid of Joe Hart,” the former Republic of Ireland international told Jonathan Overand on BBC Radio 5Live, broadcast at 12noon on 4 December.

The 40-year-old shot-stopper played 37 times for Aston Villa in the top flight after joining for a fee believed to be around £3.5 million from Manchester City in 2011.

Given was running the rule over City's performance against Chelsea for the BBC this weekend.

Antonio Conte's Blues managed to win 3-1 at the Etihad, with goals from Diego Costa, Willian and Eden Hazard cancelling out the hosts' opener, which came courtesy of a Gary Cahill own goal.

And Given added: “Hart is a better goalkeeper, Bravo was brought in because he was supposedly better with his feet but Joe wasn’t given the chance to prove he could fit in to Guardiola’s system."

Given continued: “I think Guardiola might rue [letting Hart go] at the end of the season because there’s a few goals going in that you could possibly question Bravo on.

“Bravo wasn’t set [for the Willian goal], one of his feet was off the ground, and he couldn’t move and he couldn’t dive.

"He could see him coming and he should be set, he should be ready for it.”
