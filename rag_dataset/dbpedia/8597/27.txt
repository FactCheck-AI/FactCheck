Aston Villa have been in exceptional form since Unai Emery's appointment in October 2022, and the Spaniard has brought them on the cusp of a return to European football in the 2023/24 campaign.

After finishing 7th on the final day of last season, Villa were granted a UEFA Europa Conference League qualifier berth for 2023/24, and they secured a superb 5-0 first leg playoff win at Scottish side Hibernian, to put themselves on the brink of the group stages.

The Villans' resurgence under Emery has been eye-catching, and a return to Europe would not be unfamiliar territory for the club, despite the three seasons they spent in the Championship until 2019.

When were Aston Villa last in Europe?

Villa last competed in Europe when they participated in the UEFA Europa League in the 2010/11 season, marking the third successive campaign in which they took part in the competition.

Unfortunately for Villa, their European exploits ended in August against the same opponents on both of their latter two attempts to reach the Europa League proper.

Rapid Vienna went through in the second leg of the playoffs at Villa Park in 2009 and 2010, winning on away goals after a 2-2 draw on their first visit and going through 4-3 on aggregate after a 3-2 win in front of almost 30,000 people a year later.

Villa fared better in 2008, progressing from the group stage to set up an unsuccessful round of 32 tie against CSKA Moscow, who drew 1-1 at Villa Park before winning the return leg 2-0.

How many times have Aston Villa been in Europe?

Starting with a first-round exit from the 1975-76 UEFA Cup - the predecessor to the Europa League - there have been 17 seasons when Villa have played in Europe.

Villa earned a comeback 2-2 draw in the first leg of the quarterfinals of the 1977-78 competition after Johan Cruyff had scored one of Barcelona's goals at Villa Park, and they took the lead at Camp Nou before the Spanish giants produced two late replies to progress 4-3 on aggregate.

Better was to come four seasons later, when a 1-0 win over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam landed Villa the European Cup and allowed them to enter the UEFA Super Cup the following season, which they won with revenge over Barca.

Their European Cup defence ended in the quarterfinals against Juventus, and five early exits from the UEFA Cup followed between 1983 and the 1997-98 season, when they reached the quarterfinals but were beaten on away goals despite a second-leg home win over Atletico Madrid.

Alongside Paris Saint-Germain and Troyes, Villa were one of three winners of the 2001 Intertoto Cup – a tournament with a reward of UEFA Cup entry, which was discontinued in 2008.
