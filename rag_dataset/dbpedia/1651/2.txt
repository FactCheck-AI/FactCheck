Special Sneak Peek Pilot Screenings

Comic-Con and Warner Bros. Television proudly continue their annual Preview Night tradition, with exclusive world premiere screenings of the pilot episodes of four of the most highly anticipated series of the 2015-16 television season.

Supergirl-In the vast DC Comics Universe of superheroes, the rich mythology of Superman, the planet Krypton and the House of El is perhaps the most famous and instantly recognizable. Enter Supergirl! Born Kara Zor-El on the doomed planet Krypton, the preteen Kara escaped at the same time as the infant Kal-El but didn't arrive on Earth until many years later after being lost in the Phantom Zone. Protected and raised by her adopted family, the Danvers, Kara grew up in the shadow of her foster sister, Alex, and learned to hide the phenomenal powers she shares with her famous cousin. Years later, at age 24, living in National City and working as an assistant for Catco Worldwide Media mogul Cat Grant, Kara has spent so many years trying to fit in that she forgot to ever stand out. All that changes when she decides to embrace her superhuman abilities and become the hero she was always destined to be. With the help of Daily Planet photographer James Olsen, her bioengineer sister Alex, and the research of the super-secret, off-the-grid Department of Extra-Normal Operations (DEO) and its head, Hank Henshaw, who are tasked with keeping the Earth safe from aliens, Kara takes to the skies to protect her world. Her foes include both a sinister extraterrestrial menace and the high-tech terrestrial threat of clever villains with powerful weaponry. The series stars Melissa Benoist (Whiplash, Glee), Chyler Leigh (Grey's Anatomy), and Mehcad Brooks (True Blood), with David Harewood (Homeland) and Calista Flockhart (Brothers & Sisters), and is executive produced by Greg Berlanti (The Flash, Arrow), Ali Adler (Chuck), Andrew Kreisberg (The Flash, Arrow) and Sarah Schechter (Pan, The Flash). From Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, Supergirl premieres Mondays at 8/7c on CBS this November.

Blindspot-Sullivan Stapleton (300: Rise of an Empire) and Jaimie Alexander (Thor films) star in Blindspot, a one-hour action thriller from Berlanti Productions (The Flash, Arrow, Pan) and writer/executive producer Martin Gero (Stargate: Atlantis). Stapleton plays hardened FBI agent Kurt Weller, who is drawn into a complex conspiracy when a naked amnesiac, Jane Doe (Alexander), is found in Times Square covered in a series of cryptic tattoos…including his name on her back. As Weller and his teammates at the FBI begin to investigate the veritable treasure map found in Jane Doe's tattoos, they are drawn into a high-stakes underworld that twists and turns through a labyrinth of secrets and revelations-the information they uncover might ultimately change the world. In addition to Stapleton and Alexander, the series stars Rob Brown (Treme), Audrey Esparza (Public Morals), Ukweli Roach (Eternal Law), Ashley Johnson (The Killing), and Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Without a Trace). From Berlanti Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television Blindspot premieres this fall Mondays at 10/9c on NBC.

Containment– When a mysterious and deadly epidemic breaks out in Atlanta, a vast urban quarantine is quickly enforced, forcing those stuck on the inside to fight for their lives while local and federal officials desperately search for a. Torn apart from their loved ones, the survivors trapped within the cordon are fighting against not only fatal infection but also isolation, fear, and the disintegration of society around them. But as they begin to gain each other's trust, hope remains, and on either side of the cordon unlikely heroes will rise. Containment stars David Gyasi (Interstellar), Christina Moses (How We Met), Chris Wood (The Vampire Diaries), Kristen Gutoskie, Claudia Black (The Originals), George Young, Hanna Mangan Lawrence ( Spartacus: Vengeance), and Trevor St. John (One Life to Live). Based on the original Belgian series created by Carl Joos for Eyeworks, Containment is produced by My So-Called Company in association with Warner Bros. Television, with executive producers Julie Plec (The Vampire Diaries, The Originals) and David Nutter (The Flash, Arrow).

Lucifer-Lucifer is the story of the original fallen angel. Bored and unhappy as the Lord of Hell, Lucifer Morningstar has resigned his throne and retired to the City of Angels, where he owns an upscale piano bar called Lux. When a beautiful pop star is murdered, for the first time in roughly 10 billion years, he feels something awaken deep within him. Is he actually capable of feelings for a human being? The very thought disturbs him. The murder attracts the attention of LAPD homicide detective Chloe Dancer, who finds herself both repulsed and fascinated by Lucifer. At the same time, God's emissary, the angel Amenadiel, has been sent to Los Angeles to convince Lucifer to return to Hell. But with the City of Angels at his feet and a newfound purpose, Lucifer's having too much fun to go back now. Sexy, dark and irreverent, Lucifer stars Tom Ellis (Rush), Lauren German (Chicago Fire), DB Woodside (24, Buffy the Vampire Slayer), Lesley-Ann Brandt (Spartacus series), Nicholas Gonzalez (Sleepy Hollow), Scarlett Estevez, and Rachael Harris (The Hangover) and is executive produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean films), Jonathan Littman (CSI series), Tom Kapinos (Californication), Ildy Modrovich (Necessary Roughness), Len Wiseman (Underworld films), and Joe Henderson (Almost Human).

Comics Arts Conference #1: Scholar #1: Lost (and Found!) Comics Studies of the Past

Over the past year, a number of surprising (and stunning) lost comics studies have come to light. Carol Tilley (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) and Brad Ricca(Super Boys: The Amazing Adventures of Jerry Siegel & Joe Shuster) present and discuss the 1942 comics thesis of Superman artist Paul Cassidy, newly discovered by Sean Howe. Tilley will reveal additional comics theses from the 1930s and 1940s that expand our understanding of comics production practices, readership trends, and practical applications. So who did the first real work on comics? What can we learn from them? What do we do with their work? And, most provocatively, is there more out there? This panel will debate why this question strikes such a nerve with scholars, fans, and readers. Why is it so important to find the first scholar, and does that tell us something about why comics studies started in the first place?

Comic Book Law School 101: Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda

From inception through execution, from plotting to publishing, from the comic page to the silver screen, the road to success is long and paved with many road markers, sites to see, and, unfortunately, obstacles. Comic Book Law School is designed to help you navigate the best possible route and provide help in deciphering the map legend. Noted IP attorney Michael Lovitz, author of The Trademark and Copyright Book comic book, presents the first of three fun, interactive, and informative programs, which this year will progressively study the case of fictional client Fitzgerald Scott, a fledgling comic book writer, and explore the many stages involved in the creation, development, protection, and commercialization of his newest comic book creation, The Strange Situation of Benjamin "Button" Cabeza. This first installment focuses on "The Basics," in an effort to provide the necessary foundation needed for understanding the different intellectual property rights available to creators and business owners; and will include insights on how to protect those rights, focusing on how best to safeguard ideas, creative works, characters, brands and names, from conception through publication. Attendees are invited to participate in an interactive discussion about rights provided under U.S. copyright and trademark laws, including a discussion on the protections these laws provide, the benefits of federal registrations, tips on working with collaborators, and issues of joint authorship and work-made-for-hire. Along the way, there will be plenty to learn about the protections available, as well as the numerous potential pitfalls, under the U.S. trademark and copyright systems. [Please note that Comic Book Law School seminars are designed to provide relevant information and insights to practicing attorneys, as well as practical tips to creators and other professionals who may wish to attend.

CBLDF: Spinner Rack Revolution: The Secret History of Free Speech in Magazine Comics

In the 1960s and '70s, publishers fled from spinner racks to magazine stands to escape the bounds of the Comics Code Authority. While comic books continued to labor under the stigma of low-value, juvenile speech, the larger-format magazine comics broke out, giving artists a safe haven to openly deal with adult content, provide more horror and suspense, and be frank about sexuality. Magazines like Mad, Creepy, and Eerie paved the way for a generation of titles that included Heavy Metal, Vampirella, Epic Illustrated, 1984, and Savage Sword of Conan to break new ground for a general audience and loosen the reins on some of comics' top creators. CBLDF deputy director Alex Coxreveals the untold history of magazine comics, reviewing the impact of publications from Warren, Marvel, Heavy Metal, National Lampoon, and more!

Comics Arts Conference #4: Eisner vs. Eisner: The Spirit at 75

Panelists Scott McCloud (Understanding Comics), Michael Uslan (Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice), Trina Robbins ( Pretty in Ink: American Women Cartoonists 1896-2013),Karen Green (Columbia University), Jared Gardner (Ohio State University), and moderator Danny Fingeroth (Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics and the Creation of the Superhero) discuss the two major phases of Will Eisner's career. Beginning with the 1940 creation of his iconic character the Spirit, used by Eisner to tell stories of sophistication and depth, the discussion will then shift to his 1970s reinvention of comics, catalyzing the literary comics movement with A Contract with God, the first of many graphic novels he'd create. While The Spirit is by no means forgotten, it wrestles for primacy regarding what Eisner's more important achievements were. Academia tends to focus on his personal work of the '70s and beyond. This focus overlooks, perhaps due to The Spirit's action-adventure milieu, the fact that in the feature Eisner told stories with great personal meaning, a harbinger of the rich work to come. Today, we celebrate the innovations of 23-year-old Eisner, explore what makes the Spirit important, and trace Eisner's evolving interests, from action-adventure to memoir and social commentary.
