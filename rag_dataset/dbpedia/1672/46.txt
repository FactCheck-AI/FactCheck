LAS VEGAS (AP) — Ki-Ki Moore had 22 points and 11 rebounds and Fresno State scored 23 straight points overlapping the halftime break en route to a 76-70 victory over San Diego State in the championship game of the Mountain West Conference tournament on Saturday.

The Bulldogs (24-8) trailed 34-33 with about two minutes left in the first half, but scored 12 straight before the intermission and opened the second half with an 11-0 run to go on top 56-34 with 16:25 remaining.

Alex Sheedy scored 11 points during the run and finished with 21 for Fresno State. Rosie Moult added 14 points and Bree Farley had 13.

Chelsea Hopkins had 15 points, 15 rebounds and eight assists to lead San Diego State (26-6). Courtney Clements also scored 15.

The Aztecs weren't finished after the Bulldogs' outburst, as they responded with an 18-4 run of their own to pull within 60-52 with 10:44 left. Clements had nine points during that spurt.

San Diego State got within 71-69 on Chairese Culberson's basket with 1:08 left. But Sheedy made three free throws with 49 seconds remaining after being fouled while attempting a 3-pointer to extend the lead back to five.

Moore added two more free throws with 9 seconds left to give Fresno State a 76-70 lead and seal the outcome. Moore made 10 of 11 free throws in the game while the Bulldogs made good on 17 of 18 attempts.

Fresno also hit 9 of 22 3-point attempts and turned the ball over just six times, which helped them overcome a 43-31 rebounding disadvantage.

Sheedy started the Bulldogs' 23-0 run with eight straight points on two 3-pointers and two free throws. Fresno State added two more baskets in the final three seconds of the half when Farley hit a basket and Taylor Thompson followed with a steal and a score at the buzzer.

The Aztecs won both regular-season games against Fresno State, including a 74-49 victory on Feb. 9. This is the first season that the Bulldogs have competed in the Mountain West.

Conference USA: Tulsa 75, Central Florida 66

TULSA, Okla. (AP) — Taleya Mayberry had 25 points, eight rebounds and four steals as Tulsa defeated Central Florida 75-66 Saturday in the championship game of the Conference USA tournament.

The sixth-seeded Golden Hurricane (17-16) earned their second berth in the NCAA tournament (the other came in 2006) and pushed their record over .500 for the first time this season. Tulsa has won 10 of its past 13 games, including four straight in the tournament.

Neither team led by more than three until Mayberry came up with steals and layups on consecutive possessions to give Tulsa a 28-23 lead. She scored again on a rebound and another full-court drive to give Tulsa a 34-27 lead and the Hurricane maintained that advantage to lead 41-34 at the break.

Gevenia Carter led eighth-seeded Central Florida (16-18) with 22 points, including a jumper that pulled the Knights within 70-66 with 2:02 left. But it turned out to be UCF's final basket. Brihanna Jackson added 16 points.

Tulsa became the lowest seed to win the C-USA tournament, with the previous low being a No. 5 seed twice (UCF in 2009 and TCU in 2003).

Ashley Clark scored 14 points, including four free throws in the final 28 seconds to preserve the lead for Tulsa. Loren McDaniel had 14 points and six rebounds and Kelsee Grovey had 12 points, including a drive that gave the Hurricane a 70-59 lead with 3:20 left.

Tulsa shot 48.3 percent while limiting Central Florida to 38.5 percent shooting. Mayberry, a senior point guard, hit 10 of 17 from the field and controlled the game with just two turnovers despite heavy pressure from the Knights.

Mayberry is the daughter of former NBA and University of Arkansas star Lee Mayberry, a Tulsa native and current resident.

"She was not willing to let this be her last game," said Tulsa coach Matilda Mossman. "UCF did a great job and played their hearts out. There was just one difference in this game and that was we had Taleya Mayberry and they did not."

Mayberry knew it was her night when a second-half shot came to rest on the flange behind the rim for nearly five seconds before dropping through. That put Tulsa ahead 49-37 and the lead reached 60-45 with 10 minutes left before UCF began chipping away.

Atlantic 10: Saint Joseph's 47, Fordham 46

NEW YORK (AP) — Natasha Cloud scored 15 points to help Saint Joseph's rally to beat Fordham 47-46 and win the Atlantic 10 on Saturday night, earning the Hawks their first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2000.

Trailing 47-45 with 30 seconds left, Fordham's Erin Rooney hit the first of two free throws. Her second shot rolled off the rim, but Saint Joseph's couldn't corral the rebound giving the Rams one final chance. They couldn't get a shot off as Samantha Clark was called for an offensive foul with 6.7 seconds left.

Fordham fouled Chatilla van Grinsven a few seconds later. She missed both free throws, but Marah Strickland's heave from the opposite foul line was way short setting off a wild celebration.

Strickland scored 16 points to lead the Rams (24-8), who were trying for their first NCAA bid since 1994 when they won the Patriot League.

The fourth-seeded Hawks have an impressive NCAA resume with a victory over then-No. 5 Maryland in November and a win over No. 18 Dayton in the semifinals of the Atlantic 10 tournament.

The Rams scored the first 12 points of the game as Saint Joseph's got off to a terrible start missing its first 11 shots. Ashley Prim finally got the Hawks on the board with a layup 7 minutes in. They got within 16-12 before Arielle Collins' 3-pointer made it an eight-point game.

Fordham led 24-16 at the half.

Trailing 30-22 early in the second half, Cloud — who earned outstanding player of the tournament honors — got the Hawks going scoring five points during a 12-0 run. Van Grinsven's layup made it 31-30 and gave the Hawks their first lead of the game. Mireia Vila's 3-pointer capped the burst and made it a four-point game with 10:47 left.

Saint Joseph's (23-8) couldn't extend its lead and Strickland's 3-pointer with 3:58 left made it 40-39. Moments later Abigail Corning hit a 3 to give Fordham the lead with 3:12 left.

The two teams then traded big shots before van Grinsven hit two free throws with 1:47 left. Those would be the last points until Rooney's free throw with 30 seconds left as both teams missed the front end of 1-and-1's from the free throw line.

Saint Joseph's improved to 3-8 in A-10 finals with the last victory coming back in 1999. Fordham coach Stephanie Gaitley led the Hawks back then and also guided them to an at-large bid to the NCAAs the next season. Gaitley left Saint Joseph's a year later after she was fired.

Despite the tough loss, the Rams have flourished under Gaitley since she came to the school two seasons ago from Monmouth. They reached victory milestones they haven't achieved in decades, clinching their first winning seasons since 1994-95. Fordham also won 10 games out of conference for the first time since 1983-84. Not too shabby for a team that went 0-29 in 2008 to set the NCAA record for futility in a season.

None of the current players were on that team and the Rams have benefited from two stellar transfers. Rooney followed Gaitley from Monmouth when she took over the Rams' program two years ago. Rooney had to sit out last season because of transfer rules, but has made an impact this year.

Strickland also transferred into Fordham after spending time at Maryland and South Carolina.

This was the first year that the women, along with the men, played at the Barclays Center. In the past the women played their tournament on four consecutive days in Philadelphia. Now these two teams had a six-day break to prepare for the final.

America East: Albany 61, Hartford 52

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Tournament most valuable player Megan Craig had 16 points and seven rebounds, Shereesha Richards and Lindsey Lowrie added 12 points apiece, and top-seeded Albany (N.Y.) rallied past Hartford 61-52 on Saturday night to win its second straight America East Conference tournament.

The defending champion Great Danes (27-3), regular-season champions for the first time in program history, ended the regular season as the lone undefeated team in league play at 16-0. They've won 28 straight games against America East opponents, including the postseason.

Albany swept second-seeded Hartford (21-11) in the season series, posting a 55-48 overtime win in Albany before recording a 66-55 road win. The Great Danes beat New Hampshire 71-57 in the conference semifinals for their 18th straight win and were beating their conference opponents by an average of nearly 24 points.

The Hawks were seeking their sixth title and came up just short. They used a strong defensive performance to beat No. 6 seed Vermont 64-33 in the semifinals. Hartford held Vermont to just eight first-half points and forced 31 turnovers to tie the league postseason record.

The Albany men beat Vermont 53-49 earlier Saturday to make the NCAA field for the first time since 2007, spoiling the day for the sellout crowd of 3,245 in the hostile environment of the Catamounts' Patrick Gym. The Albany men became the first team seeded lower than third to win the title and set a school season record with their 24th victory.

The women joined them later despite an off night for Ebone Henry, the all-time leading scorer in school history for Albany (1,631 points). She missed her first seven shots and had failed to score as the midpoint of the second half loomed and the Great Danes trailed by four points.

But after missing an open 3-point attempt from the wing, Henry converted a pair of runners in the lane sandwiched around a fast-break layup by Richards to give Albany a 42-40 lead with 8:20 to play.

When Julie Forster fouled out with 6:58 left after notching 10 points and four steals and snaring six rebounds, the Great Danes were without their best rebounder, but they failed to wilt.

Henry set up Richards for a shot off the glass and a 52-48 lead with 2:56 left. After Nikkia Smith's layup moved Hartford into a 52-all tie with 97 seconds left, Albany scored nine straight points as its defense clamped down.

With fans holding up a sign that read "Dancing Danes" and roaring, Sarah Royals scored from the lane and the 6-foot-8 Craig followed with a shot off the glass as the Danes pulled away.

Smith led Hartford with a game-high 18 points, the only Hartford player in double figures. Shanise Bultron had seven points and Amber Bepko finished with six for Hartford, which was outscored 38-14 in the paint.

Bultron, who entered the game shooting 5 of 6 from long range in the tournament, snapped a 28-all tie with a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 16:23 left. Craig's shot off the glass put Albany back in front less than two minutes later in a game where the biggest lead was eight.

Craig proved difficult for the Hawks to handle all night. She had two easy layups and Forster added two more as Albany reeled off 10 straight points to gain a 15-8 lead in the first 5 minutes of play. The surge came after Bepko's four-point play had given Hartford an 8-5 lead.

With cheerleaders and pep bands from both schools rocking SEFCU Arena on Albany's campus, the Hawks matched the Great Danes at every turn in the first half and halfway through the second.

After Richards' fast-break layup staked Albany to a 24-16 lead at 6:40, Hartford closed the half with a 10-1 spurt to take a 26-25 lead into the locker room. Daphne Elliott started the rush with a 3-pointer from the top of the key and Bultron finished it with a pair of baskets in the final 2:18, the first a pretty floater over the outstretched arms of Craig.

The Hawks' total was just about right for Albany, which entered the game ranked third in the nation, allowing 48.6 points per game. What the Great Danes were lacking in the first half was any sort of scoring contribution from Henry, who missed all four shots she attempted, though she did have three assists.

Patriot League: Navy 72, Holy Cross 53

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Kara Pollinger tied a career high with 24 points, Chole Stapleton added 19, and Navy won its third straight Patriot League title by defeating Holy Cross 72-53 Saturday night.

The victory comes with an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Navy (21-11) is the second team to win three consecutive Patriot League championships; Holy Cross captured four in a row from 1998-2001.

Navy does not have a senior on the roster. The second-seeded Midshipmen beat Holy Cross by 13 and 24 points during the regular season.

Brisje Malone scored 17 for the fourth-seeded Crusaders (18-14), who went 4 for 20 from 3-point range.

Navy trailed 9-7 before Pollinger made a three-point play to put the Midshipmen ahead for good. That was part of an 11-0 run that concluded with successive 3-pointers by Stapleton.

Minutes later, Stapleton drilled another 3 to spark a 10-2 spurt that gave Navy a 33-19 lead.

Big Sky: Montana 56, Northern Colorado 43

MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — Kenzie De Boer scored 19 points, and Montana punched its ticket to the NCAA tournament with a 56-43 victory over Northern Colorado in Saturday's Big Sky Conference championship.

The Lady Grizzlies (24-7) will be making their 20th appearance in the NCAA tournament. They have an all-time record of 6-19 at the NCAAs.

Montana and Northern Colorado (20-12) exchanged defensive blows in the first half, with both teams shooting low percentages. UNC shot 28 percent in the first half, including 17 percent from the 3-point line.

Despite shooting well early, with three 3s in the first 5 minutes, the Lady Griz cooled off and shot 32 percent for the first half. De Boer led all first half-scorers with nine points.

Montana held the conference's defensive player of the year, D'Shara Strange, to three first half points and stymied her usual attack-the-basket style of play.

Big West: Cal Poly 63, Pacific 49

ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Ariana Elegado scored a game-high 22 points, and Cal Poly beat Pacific 63-49 in the Big West Conference championship game Saturday afternoon.

The win gave the Mustangs their first-ever Big West tournament championship and guaranteed them a spot in the NCAA tournament. It will be the program's first ever NCAA tournament appearance.

Cal Poly junior Molly Schlemer, the conference player of the year, was held to only seven points but pulled down a game-high 16 rebounds. She was named the tournament MVP.

Gena Johnson scored 14 points to lead the Tigers, who entered on a six-game winning streak and were the top seed in the tournament. Pacific is now 0-5 all-time in Big West tournament championship games and has never been to the NCAA tournament.

The Mustangs led 33-21 at halftime and never trailed in the second half. They had won both regular-season meetings between the teams by a combined four points.

Elegado, a sophomore guard, scored 15 of her points in the second half to help hold off a late Pacific charge. She was 5 of 11 from the floor and hit 9 of 10 free throws.

Seniors Caroline Reeves and Nikol Allison each chipped in 10 points for the Mustangs.

The Mustangs were effective getting to the free-throw line and converted once they got there. They had 30 free throw attempts and made 24 of them.

Cal Poly led by at least two possessions for the final 11 minutes of the first half and the entire second half. Pacific opened the second half on an 8-0 run to pull within four but couldn't get any closer the rest of the way.

The Mustangs handily won the battle on the boards, outrebounding the Tigers 46-28.

Cal Poly's defense also ensured Pacific had a rough shooting day. The Tigers shot 33 percent from the field, including 24 percent from 3-point range, and made only 5 of 11 free throws.

In addition to Johnson's 14, Erica McKenzie scored 11 points and Kendall Rodriguez had 10 for the Tigers.

Cal Poly became the first No. 2 seed to win the tournament since Hawaii in 1996.

Elegado, McKenzie, Johnson, Long Beach State's Devin Hudson and Cal State Fullerton's Mya Olivier were named to the all-tournament team.
