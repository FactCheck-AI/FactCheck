The horse "Golan" has won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot, but the man responsible for the horse did not live to see the victory.

Golan with Kieren Fallon aboard and trained by Sir Michael Stoute, broke to the front on the inside in the last furlong to edge "Nayef" by a head and win the race. "Zindabad" was third three and one-half lengths back.

The race is the centerpiece of the flat-racing season and the only British leg of horse racing's World Series.

Sadly, Lord Arnold Weinstock, the man responsible for keeping Golan on the track when scheduled to retire to stud, did not live to see the victory. The former head of Marconi electrical company died Tuesday at home at age 78.
