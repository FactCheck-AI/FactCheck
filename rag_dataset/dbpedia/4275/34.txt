Lord Weinstock, who sold a share in Golan to Coolmore shortly before this year's Derby, was keen for the horse to continue racing.

After talks with Coolmore it was decided to challenge for further honours in 2002 through a likely partnership of Weinstock and Michael Tabor and Sue Magnier.

"Lord Weinstock was very keen to keep him in training, Mr Tabor loves having an older horse and Golan will be staying with us," said a delighted Stoute.

Golan was placed in the Derby and Irish Derby after his Guineas triumph and also won the Prix Niel before finishing fourth in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.

Lord Weinstock's bloodstock agent John Warren added: "Sir Michael really feels he has a serious chance of proving himself at the top level as a four-year-old.

"If you had taken Galileo out he would have been the winner of the Guineas and the Derby and there should be many opportunities for him next year.

"He's an ace of a horse and you'd never be frightened to take on anything with him.

"Everyone is very bullish about his prospects for next season."
