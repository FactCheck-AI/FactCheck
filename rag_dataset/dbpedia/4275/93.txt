SIR MICHAEL STOUTE has his Eye on the 2000 Guineas as he bids to prove he is still a Classic Expert.

The five-time Derby winning trainer is going for a sixth win in tomorrow’s Newmarket thriller.

Stoute used to be a fixture in the winners’ enclosures at all the Classics. Yet the nine-time British champion trainer’s last Blue Riband win came at Epsom in 2010 with Ryan Moore and Workforce.

You have to go back even further for Stoute’s last 2000 Guineas winner in 2001.

Few would have thought then - as Kieren Fallon booted home Golan - Stoute would still be waiting for his next success in the Flat season’s opening Classic.

Expert Eye, the easy winner of last year’s Group 3 Vintage Stages at Gooodwood, is 8-1 to end the drought tomorrow and Stoute said: “We have always rated him.

“He needed the run when he was second to James Garfield in the Greenham as we hadn’t done a lot with him.

“His work since has been excellent. I am happy with him and looking forward to the race.”
