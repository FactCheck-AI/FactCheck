The Kathmandu Metropolitan City will be signing a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a sister city with Chengdu, the capital of China’s Sichuan province, on Friday.

KMC Chief and Executive Officer Rudra Singh Tamang, and Secretary of Communist Party of China and the former mayor of Chengdu, Tang Liangzhi, will sign the MoU to that effect.

“This understanding will be helpful in building people-to-people relationships between the two countries. It will be largely beneficial for the development for our metropolis,” said Tamang.
