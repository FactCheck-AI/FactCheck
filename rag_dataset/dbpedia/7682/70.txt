The Fifth Head of Cerberus by Gene Wolfe 2022; near fine to fine softcover book, no dust jacket (as issued); never having been read and as new, the book is clean, tight, square, and -- but for a remainder mark to the top page edges (see photo) -- free of any markings; book cover (wrap) shows very light shelf wear but remains in near fine to fine condition.
