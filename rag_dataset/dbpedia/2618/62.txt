This vintage volume contains Sigrid Undset’s seminal trilogy, “Kristin Lavransdatter”. Following the story of a strong-willed heroine Kristin and her attempt to rebuild her life in the wake of the Black Death, Undset interlaces the political, social, and religious past, with day-to-day familial life – in order to present a vibrant and profound illustration of fourteenth-century Norway. This fantastic trilogy is highly recommended for those with an interest in medieval Scandinavia and constitutes a must-read for fans of Undset’s wonderful work. Sigrid Undset (1882–1949) was a Norwegian novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1928. The original books were first published between 1920–1922 and Read & Co. Books is now republishing this fantastic novel complete with an excerpt from ‘Six Scandinavian Novelists’ by Alrik Gustafrom.
