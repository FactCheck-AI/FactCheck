We’re really saddened to hear of the death of our former manager Trevor Thompson.

He took over the reins midway through the 1986-87 season before being eventually replaced by Bill Brindley.

As a player, he had begun his career in the mid 1970s with West Brom, when Johnny Giles was player manager and a young Bryan Robson was first breaking into the squad.

The popular Newcastle-born defender later made 80 league appearances for Lincoln City.

Our condolences go to Trevor’s family and friends
