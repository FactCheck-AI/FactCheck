On this tour we’ll be visiting the main attractions in the city centre and the the Petrovaradin Fortress with the tales of its amazing history, before heading on to Sremski Karlovci.

Sremski Karlovci

Sremski Karlovci is a charming little wine destination of Serbia where we have the chance to taste the Bermet – the wine prepared with herbs, which is the landmark of Karlovci. The quality of the wine here is so high that, back in the time of the Austrian Hungarian Empire, the Viennese Court exempted the wine growers of Karlovci from mandatory military service so that they could keep on producing wine. On this tour we will visit the town of Sremski Karlovci where we will taste the local wine and enjoy lunch in a local restaurant.
