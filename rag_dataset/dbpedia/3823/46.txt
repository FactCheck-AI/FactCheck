Introduction:

Electronic maps or eMap are digital maps with the concept of multimedia cartography plug and play which can display spatial information and multimedia elements in a dynamic and interactive ways through the compact disc media (cd) and flash drive.

Information:

There are three (3) types of maps displayed in the Electronic Map State Map, District Map and Town Map. State and District maps are produced using a scale of 1: 25,000 while Town map is generated using a scale of 1: 10,000. The information contained in the electronic map presented in the form of graphics, virtual reality, text, video and audio. The Electronic map can be used for administration of the state affairs and tourism. This is because the border region, county, town and topographical details clearly shown on the map provided. As for tourism, the location and information on places of interest (VR) which is in a state are presented in the form of attractive graphics so that it can attract tourists to visit the location.

Peta Elektronik sesuai digunakan bagi urusan pentadbiran sesebuah negeri dan juga pelancongan. Ini adalah kerana sempadan daerah, mukim, bandar serta butiran topografi ditunjukkan dengan jelas dalam peta yang disediakan. Manakala bagi tujuan pelancongan, lokasi dan informasi tempat-tempat menarik (VR) yang terdapat dalam sesebuah negeri dipersembahkan dalam bentuk grafik yang menarik supaya ia dapat menarik minat pelancong untuk melawat ke lokasi tersebut.

GPS Station

Summary:

GPS Control Marks are marks that were set up to form a control network connected to the National Reference Frame of GDM2000 through the use of GPS measurement technique. These marks were chosen for use as control in cadastre surveys, mapping, military, scientific studies and etc.

Description:

Presently there are 238 GPS Control Marks established as the Peninsular Malaysia Primary GPS Network 2000 (PMPGN2000) and 171 GPS Control Marks established as the East Malaysia Primary GPS Network 2000 (EMPGN2000). The red G symbol is the purpose-made GPS monuments which has a plate and bolt, mounted on top of a concrete monument jutting out from the ground surface. Some of theses marks are re-used triangulation pillars or fundamental benchmarks. They have GPS coordinates of the same high quality, and are equally good for the purpose of controlling GPS surveys in the GDM2000 coordinate system. In addition to those shown on this map, new GPS control marks will be established in the future.

Benchmark

Summary:

There are two types of benchmarks, namely Standard Benchmark (SBM) and Benchmark (BM).

Description:

There are two types of benchmarks:

Standard Benchmark (SBM)

It is a ground planed monument built for stability to minimised the probability of disturbance. The SBM are established within the precise leveling network to provide a stable benchmark system that will control the leveling network. The marks are located along major road system at road junctions or at every 40 kilometers intervals.

Benchmark (BM)

It is built between standard benchmarks at every half (0.5) kilometer in developed area and at every one (1) kilometer for the rest. Each benchmark has a plate and bolt, mounted on top of a concrete monument jutting out from the ground surface and they are located near or within permanent structures such as milestones, bridges, telecommunication poles and buildings (police station, school etc).

Product Name:

Geiodal Height Computation.

Summary:

Malaysian Geoid Models, MyGEOID consists of two basic models namely WMGEOID04 in Peninsular Malaysia and EMGEOID05 in Sabah and Sarawak. They are the first national geoid models produced by JUPEM through its joint consultancy with KMS of Denmark in the Airborne Gravity Survey and Geoid Determination Project. These geoid models are hybrid of gravimetric geoids with GPS ellipsoid heights on leveled bench marks. Therefore, these values are suitable for use with GPS survey to obtain mean sea level directly without further transformation.

Description:

MyGeoid2 is obtained from downward continued free-air gravity grid at zero level by spherical FFT, followed by the restore of the spherical harmonic and RTM geoid effects. It uses the latest available terrestrial and airborne data with a total of 960 x 1080 points in Peninsular Malaysia and 1080 x 1680 points in Sabah and Sarawak. WMGEOID04 and EMGEOID05 consist of a 1′ by 1′ grid (approximately 1.8km) of geoid-ellipsoid separations (N Values) relative to the Local Mean Sea Level. The Geoid Height Computation service is provided for user to key in the WGS84 coordinates of points interactively for the geoid heights required. Batch processing is also available, and for this service, the user would need to load in the input file concerned based on the required format.

MYRTK Data

Summary:

MyRTKnet is the infrastructure that has been formed by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) reference stations and Control Centre to provide the GNSS data in order to give the position in real time. MyRTKnet service has been developed in 2003 that consist of 27 GNSS reference stations throughout the country. In endeavor to give a better service to the user, another 51 GNSS reference stations have been established by Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia (DSMM) in 2006 until 2008 and the total number of reference stations now are 78 stations.

Description:

50 GNSS reference stations are located in Peninsular Malaysia whilst 28 stations in Sabah and Sarawak. The distance between the stations is from 30 to 150 km. The stations track GNSS signals and send them via dedicated data lines to a central network server at DSMM Geodesy Section, which manages and distributes GNSS correction data to subscribers in real time. Right now, the centimeter accuracy can be achieved to all users in Peninsular Malaysia, Kuching (Sarawak) and Kota Kinabalu (Sabah). The user also can get the DGPS correction anywhere in Malaysia as long as the telecommunications coverage is there.

The MyRTKnet service provides the data as stated in table below. The data that have been supplied to the user comprising of real time and post-processed data depend on the objective of work. The post-processed data consist of RINEX and Virtual RINEX data. The data can be downloaded via DSMM website in interval from 0.1 to 60 seconds. In order to get a good result, user should follow the Director General Circular No. 9/2005 which can be viewed in DSMM website.
