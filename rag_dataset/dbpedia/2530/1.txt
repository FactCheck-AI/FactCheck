When he isn’t helping craft the bangers we all love such as ‘Do What You Want’ and more recently ’14U+14ME’ as one half of The Presets, Kim Moyes spends his time honing his skills on the techno front.

Under his solo guise, K.I.M – and in collaboration with Mike Callander – Moyes has announced his own imprint, Here To Hell, with the first release dropping next month.

The Sydney based label will kick things off with an offering from Zero Percent (K.I.M and Mike Callander’s joint project), in the way of 2 exclusive remixes of The Drones song ‘Boredom’ from their 2016 album ‘Feeling Kinda Free’.

This will be followed by HTH002, an original release from Zero Percent that will come paired with a remix from The Mole, set to drop in May.
