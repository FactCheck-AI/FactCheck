From the walking dead at the Winchester to the barely-clothed in Sheffield, these films had us in hysterics. Welcome to WatchMojo UK and today we'll be counting down our picks for the top 10 British comedy films.

For this list, we are focussing on the best, laugh out loud comedy films to hail from the British Isles, from classic Ealing comedies to raunchy rom coms. And just to be clear, we're keeping to one entry per franchise.

Special thanks to our user RichardFB for submitting the idea on our interactive suggestion tool: WatchMojo.comsuggest
