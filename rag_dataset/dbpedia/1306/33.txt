Sure, Ray and The Kinks recorded arguably the greatest Christmas song ever but is that enough for Ray? Surely not. He just had to go ahead and write a Thanksgiving song. Who does that? Nobody except Ray Davies. Happy Thanksgiving! Lyrics and video below

Thanksgiving Day by Ray Davies

Are you going on Thanksgiving Day

To those family celebrations?

Passing on knowledge down through the years

At the gathering of generations

Every year it's the same routine

All over, all over

Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

Papa looks over at the small gathering

Remembering days gone by

Smiles at the children as he watches them play

And wishes his wife was still by his side

She would always cook dinner on Thanksgiving Day

It's all over, it's all over

It's all over the American way

But sometimes the children are so far away

And in a dark apartment on the wrong side of town

A lonely spinster prays

For a handsome lover and a passionate embrace

And kisses all over, all over

All over her American face

It's all over, it's all over, it's all over

'Cause today she feels so far away

From the friends in her hometown

So she runs for the Greyhound

She'll spend hours on the bus but she'll reach town

For Thanksgiving Day

Come on over, come on over

Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

Come on over, come on over

Come on over, come on over

Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

At a truck stop a man sits alone at the bar

Estranged in isolation

It's been a while now and he seems so far

From those distant celebrations

He thinks back to all the mistakes that he made

To a time when he was so young and green

Innocent days when they both looked forward to that

Great American dream

Now it's all over, it's all over, all over

And all over America people are going home

On Thanksgiving Day

Now Papa looks out of the window

The sight brings a smile to his face

He sees all his children coming back home

Together on this special day

Come on over, come on over

Come on over, it's Thanksgiving Day

Life After Breakfast - Ray Davies

It's been a while since we checked in with our sporadic Sunday morning Ray Davies series, so let's jump back in with "Is There Life After Breakfast?" from Ray's first solo record, Other People's Lives.

In my opinion, one of the factors that sets the great songwriters apart is being able to write songs that can make you laugh out loud. Writing ballads is easy. In fact, it is so easy that in the history of rock and roll, only three bands have never written a decent "sad song." The first two are The Hives and AC/DC, who have avoided ballads by design. The third band is the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, who have somehow managed to avoid writing good songs in any tempo, mood or genre. Other than that, chances are that even the bar band around the corner can break out a decent tear- jerker written by their bass player sometime after his second divorce.

But to be funny, that is the next level. Or "The Chuck Berry Level" as those in the business call it. Reasonable people can disagree on whether Ray Davies is truly the best songwriter ever (he is) but I would suggest he is truly the funniest songwriter ever. Unless Weird Al counts.

I might be biased towards the song Life After Breakfast because I own a coffee shop and it has been my observation that as humans near the age of 70, meals become the primary source of pleasure. In fact, we become so excited for meal time, we just can't wait and start rushing everything. Breakfast is at 6:30 am, lunch at 11:15 am and dinner at 4:30 pm. After that I suppose it's just FOX News until bed with a bowl of ice cream around 8 pm. In the words of Mick 'n' Keith: what a drag it is getting old.

Song and lyrics below.

Lift yourself out of the doldrums

Make yourself a cuppa tea

Drag your emotions out of the gutter

Don't wallow in self pity

When you wake up, all of a fluster

Thinking life has passed you by

Give yourself a kick up the backside

Jump out of bed and punch the sky

Is there life after breakfast

Full of possibilities

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

So don't live in agony

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

Cheer up son, put on the kettle

There's no point in being glum

Make your mind up, try to forget her

Boil the tea and I'll be mum

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

So don't live in agony

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

After breakfast

Life after breakfast

After breakfast

Just because all of the plumbing

Isn't all it used to be

Turn the tap, see, a little bit's coming

That must make you feel relieved

Don't turn into a total embarrassment

To your friends and family

Get out of bed, the whole day's ahead

So take the pills and drink your tea

Is there life after breakfast

Full of possibilities

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

So don't be so depressive

Is there life after breakfast?

Yes there is, after breakfast

"Days"

Thank you for the days,

Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.

I'm thinking of the days,

I won't forget a single day, believe me.

I bless the light,

I bless the light that lights on you believe me.

And though you're gone,

You're with me every single day, believe me.

Days I'll remember all my life,

Days when you can't see wrong from right.

You took my life,

But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me,

But it's all right,

Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me.

I wish today could be tomorrow,

The night is dark,

It just brings sorrow anyway.

Thank you for the days,

Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.

I'm thinking of the days,

I won't forget a single day, believe me.

Days I'll remember all my life,

Days when you can't see wrong from right.

You took my life,

But then I knew that very soon you'd leave me,

But it's all right,

Now I'm not frightened of this world, believe me.

Days.

Thank you for the days,

Those endless days, those sacred days you gave me.

I'm thinking of the days,

I won't forget a single day, believe me.

- Ray Davies, 1968

It's Christmas Eve, take one huge guess which song we shall be featuring today? There have been many great Christmas songs, but in all seriousness, I think reasonable people can agree "Father Christmas" is right near the top of the list. We can also all probably agree that "Still Love Christmas" by me is near the top as well. (Ha.) Happy Holidays from all of us at Pencilstorm. Thanks for reading! Lyrics and video below.

"Father Christmas" Songwriter: Ray Davies

When I was small I believed in santa claus

Though I knew it was my dad

And I would hang up my stocking at christmas

Open my presents and I'd be glad

But the last time I played father christmas

I stood outside a department store

A gang of kids came over and mugged me

And knocked my reindeer to the floor

Father christmas, give us some money

Don't mess around with those silly toys.

Well beat you up if you don't hand it over

We want your bread so don't make us annoyed

Give all the toys to the little rich boys

Don't give my brother a steve austin outfit

Don't give my sister a cuddly toy

We don't want a jigsaw or monopoly money

We only want the real mccoy

Father christmas, give us some money

Well beat you up if you make us annoyed

Father christmas, give us some money

Don't mess around with those silly toys

But give my daddy a job cause he needs one

Hes got lots of mouths to feed

But if youve got one, I'll have a machine gun

So I can scare all the kids down the street

Have yourself a merry merry christmas

Have yourself a good time

But remember the kids who got nothin

While you're drinkin down your wine
