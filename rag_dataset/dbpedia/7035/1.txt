Google “Vaporwave” on the internet right now. You’ll find that it is a unique and relatively new music genre focused on electronic sounds and it tends to be spacy. It mimics sounds of the 1980s and 1990s. It also is intoxicating and something unique and it has been rapidly growing within the past couple of months. Music keeps changing, evolving, and more genres are being created just like Vaporwave.

Vaporwave contains a lot of stops and the beat can rapidly change in an instant. It takes elements and effects from other genres like pop, R&B, jazz, and even elevator music. Vaporwave reminds me of electronic music specifically played at concerts, but with a different twist.

For people who want to dive headfirst into the genre, they should check out and listen to Macintosh Plus” “Floral Shoppe.” “Floral Shoppe” is the quintessential album for this type of music. This album surprised me with all the sound effects and different elements with the stops and how it can change in an instant.

Listening to it I could see why people like the music and why it is growing. This music is for sitting back and relaxing, but it could also be used for a party as well. It is absolutely soothing to listen to. It can even be used to study or do homework if you so please to.

The music does come with its disadvantages though in barely having any words. I typically like music that has lyrics to it and at times the music can sound weird. So, vaporwave does come with its own advantages and disadvantages. People should listen to the music and judge because it is difficult to describe exactly what it’s like. It is a weird type of music that has not been around for a long time. You have to keep your mind open and listen.
