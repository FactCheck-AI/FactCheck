Movie and TV measurement brand, Rentrak, has acquired SponsorHub, a big data platform covering the sports and entertainment industry in its offer of proprietary social media measurement for sports, political and advertising brands.

The company specialises in industry benchmarking for brands in the sports technology and entertainment space. Its tools measure and track brand engagement in sports and branded entertainment initiatives which range from the Olympics and World Cup to TV and movies.

The acquisition of SponsorHub advances the former’s mission to provide audience measurement and targeting to enable marketers to reach the right audience at the right time. With the takeover, Rentrak will offer products that measure the effect of social media on television, dynamic ad insertion, online video advertising, movies, and branded content integration.

“We are excited to add social media measurement to our TV Everywhere products as it will give additional transparency and purchasing flexibility for brands and agencies through SponsorHub’s social media products,” said Bill Livek, Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Rentrak.

SponsorHub has pioneered social media analytics in sports across multiple platforms. Its X-Stream product helps advertisers better appropriate the billions of dollars spent on sports and entertainment campaigns whilst offering a real-time consumer impact index and key emotional metrics derived from billions of social conversations around athletes, celebrities, teams, leagues, and brands.
