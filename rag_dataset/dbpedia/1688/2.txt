Lucas Perez made a small piece of history for Arsenal last night, with his hat-trick against FC Basel making it two consecutive games that a Gunners player has hit a treble.

Alexis Sanchez also scored three in the 5-1 win over West Ham at the weekend, making it a very good few days indeed for Arsenal strikers.

So good in fact, that it marked a feat that the club have not managed since the end of the 2002/03 season, when they went hat-trick crazy in their final two Premier League matches.

Robert Pires and Jermaine Pennant (!) both scored a hat-trick each in just one game, a 6-1 win over Southampton, before Freddie Ljungberg scored three against Sunderland the following week.

These games were largely dead-rubber affairs, with both Arsenal and Southampton resting players in their match at Highbury, while Sunderland were already confirmed as relegated when they hosted Arsenal, who could no longer win the league, on the final day of the season.

Sanchez and Perez, however, have achieved their trebles at an important time for Arsenal, with Arsene Wenger’s side still chasing Chelsea in the title race, and managing to finish top of their Champions League group thanks to last night’s goal glut in Switzerland.

This also represents quite a turnaround in fortunes for a club who, at the start of the season, didn’t look to have any recognised world class strikers.

Sanchez has adapted superbly to his new role in the centre, while Olivier Giroud and summer signing Perez have done well whenever called upon this term.
