Jozef Poniatowski (1763-1813)

Jozef Poniatowski was among the best tactical generals of his time and fought in some of the most impressive actions, both independently and under Napoleon's command. Poniatowski had fought successfully during the 1792 Polish uprising and then in the next uprising during 1794. When Napoleon's armies marched into Poland during the autumn of 1806 he was one of the leaders in the Polish insurrection against the Prussian kingdom. In 1809 he was able to defeat Austria's invasion of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw showing his military skill against the Archduke Ferdinand. He then took part in the 1812 invasion of Russia and the subsequent German campaign of 1813 where he served with distinction and was given his marshal's baton by Napoleon although he was killed at Leipzig. According to the Emperor himself, he long intended to make Prince Poniatowski the King of Poland, there was likely no Pole who was more deserving than he, whether by merit or loyalty.
