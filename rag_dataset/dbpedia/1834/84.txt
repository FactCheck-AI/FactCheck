Are you looking for a truly unique and breathtaking experience on your next vacation? Look no further than Pha Chanadai at Pha Taem National Park in Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand. As the easternmost point of Thailand, Pha Chanadai offers visitors the chance to witness the first sunrise in the country and be among the first to greet the new day.

But Pha Chanadai isn’t just a prime location for sunrise viewing, it’s also a viewpoint where visitors can take in the stunning panoramic views of the Mekong River, which separates the border between Thailand and Laos. Imagine standing at the edge of the cliff and watching the mist rising over the river, it’s an incredible natural spectacle that can only be seen during the winter.
