Dover-Foxcroft - DOVER-FOXCROFT - Joseph C. Andrews, 86, passed away December 4, 2015, at Hibbard Nursing Home. He was born September 7, 1929, in Guilford, the son of Henry L. and Emma (Buzzell) Andrews.

He grew up in Dover-Foxcroft, and attended Foxcroft Academy, where he played football. In 1950, he joined the U.S. Navy, serving on the USS Miles C. Fox, and traveling in the Mediterranean, Caribbean, and South America. He was a member of the Chadbourne-Merrill American Legion Post No. 29. He participated in many Memorial Day Parades and helped at the Post's Beano games at the fair.

On weekday mornings you would find him waiting in front of his home for a ride into town. His wait was never long. Once in town he would visit the local stores and attend many of the sales held by clubs and churches. Joe's family would like to thank all the people of Dover-Foxcroft for everything they did for him, whether assisting when he needed help or providing a safe ride to and from town. Joe will be remembered for his unique sense of humor; his favorite was a good knock-knock joke.

Joe is survived by two brothers, Craig M. Andrews of Sebec, and Conway Andrews of Exeter.

Friends are invited to call from 12 noon until time of funeral service at 1pm, Wednesday, December 9, 2015, at the Lary Funeral Home, Dover-Foxcroft. Burial with military honors will be in the family lot in Rural Grove Cemetery. Condolences and memories may be expressed at .
