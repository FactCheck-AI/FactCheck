Below is the full statement from Arandas Bakery:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre deeply saddened to share that our patriarch Don Lupe Camarena passed away yesterday. He will be missed by his employees, friends, customers and family. We know many have shared wonderful memories with him since our bakery first opened in 1993. Don Lupe instilled a strong work ethic in us and a strong desire to fulfill his life goal of achieving the American Dream. He first started his migration to the USA working in the Brasero Program to help in raising his family of 9. His first born, our founder Don Jose Camarena, then migrated to Houston, TX and started Taquerias Arandas in 1981. As the restaurant chain quickly grew to 10 stores by 1990, his son quickly noticed the lack of Mexican Sweet Pastries (Pan Dulce) in Houston that can only be found in Mexican Panader√≠as (Bakeries). So, in 1993 he decided to open Arandas Bakery so that his father could be his own proprietor. What originally started as a small bakery to supply their own restaurants quickly grew to the now expansive 6 locations. Even though we say farewell to him today, we have faith that one day we will be reunited with him. John 11:25-26‚Ä≥
