The Marvel Animated Universe (MAU) is a fan term for cartoons based on Marvel Comics characters that share some continuity. The Marvel Animated Universe started on October 31, 1992, with X-Men and ended on March 31, 2001, with Spider-Man Unlimited. However, the MAU was revived in 2023 with X-Men '97. The Marvel Animated Universe consists of nine different television series.

Continuity errors

1. Continuity error: Scarlet Spider was created in an alternate reality but appears in the episode Nightmare in Green of Fantastic Four: The Animated Series and One Man's Worth, Part I of X-Men: The Animated Series which is part of the mainstream universe.

1. Solution: There is more than one Scarlet Spider. The one shown in Fantastic Four and X-Men is from the mainstream universe while the one that appears in the Spider-Man: The Animated Series is from an alternate reality.

2. Continuity error: In The Fantastic Four episode, To Battle a Living Planet (1995), She-Hulk is shown as a member of the Avengers. However, The Incredible Hulk episode, Doomed (1996) showed Jennifer Walters becoming She-Hulk.

2. Solution: The episode Doomed takes place before To Battle a Living Planet.

3. Continuity error: In the X-Men episode, Repo Man (1993), Sasquatch is a member of Alpha Flight. However, in The Incredible Hulk episode, Man to Man, Beast to Beast (1996), Walter Langkowski turns himself into Sasquatch for the first time.

3. Solution: Man to Man, Beast to Beat takes place before Repo Man.

4. Continuity error: Vision is shown as a member of the Avengers in the Fantastic Four episode To Battle a Living Planet (1995), but is first created by Ultron in the Avengers: United They Stand episode Avengers Assemble, Part I (1999).

4. Solution: Avengers Assemble Part 1 & 2 takes place before To Battle a Living Planet.

5. Continuity error: At the end of Secret Wars, Chapter III: Doom, Madame Web returns Captain America to the vortex, but in Fantastic Four and Avengers: United They Stand, Captain America is free from the vortex and a member of the Avengers.

5. Solution: Sometime after the events of Secret Wars, Part III: Doom, the Avengers free Captain America from the vortex and he joins the team.

6. Continuity error: At the end of the episode, Carnage, Venom and Carnage are trapped in another dimension. However, in Spider-Man Unlimited, it is stated that they were being held captive by S.H.I.E.L.D.

6. Solution: Venom and Carnage somehow escape the Dark Dimension and were captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.

7. Continuity error: In the episode Hulk Buster (1996) from Iron Man: The Animated Series, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner do not know each other personally. However, in Helping Hand, Iron Fist (1996) of The Incredible Hulk series Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are good friends.

7. Solution: Helping Hand, Iron Fist takes place after Hulk Buster.

The Silver Surfer series takes place in a totally different reality from the other seven shows. This is because Silver Surfer: The Animated Series contradicts several events from Fantastic Four: The Animated Series.

Timeline

If you don't go by air dates it is possible to create a streamline continuity between all the shows despite all of the series being created by different people. Some episodes could take place around the same time.

Despite Spider-Man: The Animated Series lasting for five years, several episodes take place within the span of a few months. This is the same for other series in the Marvel Animated Universe.

Alternate realities

According to The Official Marvel Handbook the different series take place in different realities. But for the purpose of this wiki all series in the Marvel Animated Universe are to be treated as if they exist in the same universe, with the exception of Silver Surfer: The Animated Series. This is because Silver Surfer: The Animated Series contradicts the events of Fantastic Four: The Animated Series far too much to be considered part of the main universe.

Other Cartoon Universes

There have been several different attempts at creating a multi-series cartoon universe with Marvel properties.

The first cartoon universe was started in 1966 in a series called The Marvel Super Heroes. There were five different segments that were a part of this show. They are Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, and Namor, the Sub-Mariner. One segment aired each day during the week: Captain America on Monday, Hulk on Tuesday, Iron Man on Wednesday, Thor on Thursday, and Namor on Friday.

In 1981 the studio called Marvel Productions started to produce shows based on Marvel characters. These shows were Spider-Man, Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends, The Incredible Hulk, and the television pilot, Pryde of the X-Men. Pryde of the X-Men only had a pilot episode and was not picked up for series.

The Marvel Animated Universe started in 1992 with X-Men: The Animated Series and ended in 2001 with Spider-Man: Unlimited. As said above the MAU consists of eight different cartoons.

Christopher Yost created his own Marvel cartoon universe. This universe consists of the shows Wolverine and the X-Men, Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, and the movies Hulk vs. Wolverine, Hulk vs. Thor, and Thor: Tales of Asgard.

In 2010, Madhouse Inc. created a series of anime that were all connected. These series are Marvel Anime: Wolverine, Marvel Anime: Iron Man, Marvel Anime: X-Men, and Marvel Anime: Blade.
