Domino Records is putting out a new EP by our dudes The Count & Sinden this October featuring a song called "Hardcore Girls" with Rye Rye, who may be our all-time favorite Baltimore resident. Yes, we are counting Michael Phelps. That dude has never made a YouTube this awesome. Both Sinden and Rye Rye have been in the Gen F section of the magazine and The Count aka DJ Nine Million Names has been on this blog plenty, so this is pretty much a supergroup. Dance along to the video and try not to have a heart attack.
