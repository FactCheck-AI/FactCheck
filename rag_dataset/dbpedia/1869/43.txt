Humidity

We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in Haan is essentially constant during November, remaining around 0% throughout.

For reference, on July 13, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on October 7, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Wind

This section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.

The average hourly wind speed in Haan is essentially constant during November, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 10.9 miles per hour throughout.

For reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.5 miles per hour, while on August 4, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.2 miles per hour.

The hourly average wind direction in Haan throughout November is predominantly from the south, with a peak proportion of 46% on November 1.

Growing Season

Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).

The growing season in Haan typically lasts for 6.8 months (208 days), from around April 15 to around November 9, rarely starting before March 30 or after May 2, and rarely ending before October 13 or after December 5.

During November in Haan, the chance that a given day is within the growing season is rapidly decreasing falling from 64% to 15% over the course of the month.

frigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering

Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.

The average accumulated growing degree days in Haan are essentially constant during November, remaining within 12Â°F of 1,994Â°F throughout.

Solar Energy

This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

The average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Haan is gradually decreasing during November, falling by 0.7 kWh, from 1.5 kWh to 0.8 kWh, over the course of the month.

Data Sources

This report illustrates the typical weather in Haan, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point

There are 4 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Haan.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Haan according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.

The estimated value at Haan is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Haan and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport (EDDL, 47%, 13 mi, northwest, -407 ft elevation change)

Cologne Bonn Airport (EDDK, 23%, 23 mi, south, -249 ft elevation change)

NÃ¶rvenich Air Base (ETNN, 17%, 29 mi, southwest, -167 ft elevation change)

Dortmund Airport (EDLW, 13%, 34 mi, northeast, -128 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Haan and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data

All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

All other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.

Land Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

Elevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
