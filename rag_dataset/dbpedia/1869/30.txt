*** Forecast - Our forecast for the water temperature

Actual nearshore temperatures may vary by several degrees from the indicated values. This is noticeable after heavy rain or after prolonged periods of strong winds. Some downstream winds cause cold, deep waters to replace surface waters that have been warmed by the sun.

To develop a forecast, we use our own mathematical model, which takes into account the current change in water temperature, historical data and the main weather trends, wind strength and direction, air temperature in each specific region. We also take into account data for other resorts in Belgium.
