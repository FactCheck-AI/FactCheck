Vaduz Castle sits enthroned about 120 metres above the capital city Vaduz. It is the emblematic landmark of the capital of Liechtenstein and the seat of the countryâ€™s royal house. The castle itself is not open to visitors but guided tours of Vaduz offer interesting insights into the history of the castle and the royal house.
