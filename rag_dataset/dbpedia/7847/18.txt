Vaduz Self-Guided City Walk

Vaduz is the capital city of the Principality of Liechtenstein. The country is located between Switzerland and Austria. At only 25km long, it is one of the smallest countries in the world.

The population of Vaduz is around 5,500, so it can easily be seen in a day.

The Vaduz Self-Guided City Walk will guide you through the lovely pedestrian-only area where a number of the key buildings are located, as well as up the hillside to the castle.

The main reason to visit are the magnificent views of the mountains that surround the country, definitely a must-see.

Walk Distance 3.4km/2.1miles including a steep walk up to the castle.
