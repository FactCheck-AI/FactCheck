Located in the vibrant Polanco neighborhood of Mexico City, Museo Jumex opened its doors to the public in 2013 as a one-of-a-kind museum devoted to the production and discussion of contemporary art. Founded by Eugenio López Alonso, a pioneer in the realm of contemporary art collecting in Mexico, and designed by Sir David Chipperfield, 2023 winner of the Pritzker Architecture award, Museo Jumex has achieved international recognition for its dual mission of bringing works of renowned international artists to Mexico for the first time and elevating the work of today's Mexican and Latin American artists. This book invites us through a visual journey to revisit the most remarkable exhibitions of the last 10 years and to discover Latin America's most important art collection, Colección Jumex. This very special publication features important contributions from international renowned artists and curators such as Jeff Koons, Melanie Smith, Jessica Morgan, Humberto Moro, Abraham Cruzvillegas, Patrick Charpenel, Marìa Minera, David Chipperfield, and Massimiliano Gioni.
