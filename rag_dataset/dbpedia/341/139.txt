Jutland Jack is the nickname of John Travers Cornwell who was the youngest person to be awarded the Victoria Cross medal in World War 1. Jack aged just 16 was awarded this medal for the gallantry showed at the Navel battle of Jutland on the 31st May 1916.

in which when all his fellow gun crew where killed around him and even tho Jack himself was fatally wounded, he stood by his gun, still under fire and awaited orders until clear of the conflict. Jack passed away two days after the battle of Jutland before his mother could reach the hospital.

CEO, Director and Producer Mickey Cornwell is a relation to Jack and felt it a fitting tribute to name his Production company after the boy first class sailor.

“We will honour his good name by producing the very best in documentaries, tv and film.”
