Ferenc Molnar

Ferenc Molnar (1878-1952), Hungarian playwright and novelist, was born in Budapest. Several of his plays were presented on the New York City stage, and all were successes, including The Guardsman, Lilliom, The Swan, The Glass Slipper and The Play's the Thing. In 1928, English translations of his twenty-five plays were published. Rodgers & Hammerstein used Molnar's Lilliom as the basis for the musical Carousel; The Guardsman was adapted into the musical Enter The Guardsman by Marion Adler, Craig Bohmler, and Scott Wentworth. Molnar's plays are characterized by graceful, romantic situations and amusing dialogue.
