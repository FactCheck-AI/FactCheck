The city barely had barely 50 per cent of its annual rainfall average.

Many will remember 2020 as a record-breaking year for a variety of reasons, and several in southern Manitoba will remember it as Winnipeg’s driest year on record.

Winnipeg received 273 mm of precipitation in 2020, which was enough to barely crack 50 per cent of the city’s annual average. Record drought conditions also made an appearance in southern Saskatchewan, where Yorkton saw a mere 49 per cent of their annual average, which made 2020 their tenth driest year on record. On the contrary, 2020 marked ten years since Yorkton saw one of their wettest years on record, when 695 mm (154 per cent) fell on the town.

However, this parched pattern was certainly not observed across the rest of the province and especially not in the rest of the Prairies. Several towns in Manitoba, including Brandon, The Pas and Churchill, received 99 per cent, 89 per cent and 67 per cent of their annual average precipitation, respectively.

So, why the vast precipitation discrepancy across the Prairies?

This part of Canada heavily relies on shoulder seasons to bring rain and snow, due to the storm track migrating through the region. During the summer months, thunderstorms are the main source of rainfall in the Prairies.

Eastward moving cold fronts clash with hot, humid air masses that trigger lines of thunderstorms. If the storms become strong enough, they can provide a month's worth of rain in just one evening. Crop damage and flooding can be a real issue, while two counties over, month-long droughts could be continuing.
