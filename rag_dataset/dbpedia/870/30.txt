A post claiming that ‘Joyalukkas’ jewellery company owner has died due to COVID-19 in the Middle East is making rounds on social media. In the post, the name of the owner of ‘Joyalukkas’ jewellery company is given as ‘Joy Arakkal’. But, FACTLY has found that the owner of ‘Joyalukkas’ jewellery company is ‘Joy Alukkas’; not ‘Joy Arakkal’. Joy Arakkal is the managing director of UAE-based Innova Group of companies. He died on 23 April 2020 in Dubai. The initial news reports mentioned that Joy Arakkal has died purportedly due to heart attack, but Dubai Police, on 29 April 2020, has confirmed that Arakkal has died by jumping off the building due to financial reasons. The Arakkal Palace, Joy’s palatial house at Mananthavady, is considered to be the biggest house in Kerala. ‘Joyalukkas’ company in a Facebook post has also clarified that Joy Alukkas (the owner of the company) is safe and healthy, and Joy Arakkal is not associated with their company.
