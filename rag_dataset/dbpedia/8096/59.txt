U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron defended his decision to hire a Nepalese nanny who later became a British citizen while his government is trying to reduce immigration.

The status of the premier’s nanny was made public last week after Immigration Minister James Brokenshire made a speech attacking a “wealthy metropolitan elite” who had benefited from cheap migrant labor while British nationals competing for the same jobs saw their wages fall. Cameron was directly questioned about his employee for the first time today.
