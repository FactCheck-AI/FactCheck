Orpheus’s Generation/Geração de Orpheu

The Geração de Orpheu (Orpheus’s Generation) or Grupo de Orfeu is a group of Portuguese writers who were primarily responsible for introducing modernism into Portugal. They did this mainly through their magazine Orfeu [Orpheus] (you can still read the first one and second one in Portuguese). They were very much influenced by Vladimir Maiakovsky‘s futurism. Adherents included Fernando Pessoa and José de Almada Negreiros.
