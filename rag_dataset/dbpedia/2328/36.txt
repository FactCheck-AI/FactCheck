Ari Up, the eccentric lead singer of seminal punk band The Slits, has died aged just 48. The stepdaughter of punk icon John Lydon, AKA Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols and Public Image Limited, she rose to prominence aged just 14 forming The Slits along with her friend Palmolive, and they quickly became notorious in the nascent punk scene for their onstage antics.

Their debut album Cut would go on to serve as an inspiration for several generations of female punkers and riot grrrrrls, while the band were hugely influential to many artists. The band split up in the early 80s, but reformed in 2005, touring Australia in 2007 and playing an eccentric set at the Golden Plains Festival in 2007.

Lydon’s website, in announcing her death, said ‘John and Nora have asked us to let everyone know that Nora’s daughter Arianna (aka Ari-Up) died today (Wednesday, October 20th) after a serious illness. She will be sadly missed.’
