You may know all the states in alphabetical order, but do you know them in order of statehood? The original 13 colonies entered the Union from 1787 to 1790, and the remaining 37 were continuously admitted as late as 1959.

States are accepted into the U.S. based on Article IV, Section 3, Clause 1 of the Constitution, also known as the "Admissions Clause," according to the National Constitution Center.

Virginia might have been the first colony but another state holds the title of the first state. No need to grab a map, it's time to learn the states in order of statehood.

What was the first state?

On Dec. 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the U.S. Constitution, according to the Census Bureau. Since it was the first of the 13 original colonies to become a state, it has been aptly nicknamed "The First State." Its capital city is Dover.

Delaware celebrated its 235th anniversary of statehood in 2022.
