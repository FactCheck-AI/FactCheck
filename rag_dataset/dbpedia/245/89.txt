Daytime high temperatures reaching 32 degrees Celsius and above, and overnight lows near 16 degrees Celsius are forecast over the next several days. A slow-moving ridge of high pressure is responsible for bringing the extreme heat into Saskatchewan. At 33.6 degrees Celsius, Leader was the hotspot in Saskatchewan on Thursday.
