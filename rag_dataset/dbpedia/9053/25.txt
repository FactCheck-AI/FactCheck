Join us for an evening with Grammy-winning artist Paula Cole and special guests Morley with Chris Bruce.

Paula Cole has released music for over three decades, from her debut “Harbinger” in her androgynous combat boots and sensitive songs, to the everlasting hits of “This Fire” and “I Don’t Want to Wait”, to her genre-busting “Amen” (a neo-soul-touched tour de force). She has released seven solo albums of original songs, won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1998, and was the first woman ever to be nominated for “Producer of the Year” in her own right in that same year. Cole has been a truth-teller, a provocateur, a feminist, a rebel, and a brilliant autobiographical writer who has pushed for personal honesty and social change.

Paula Cole’s eleventh studio album, “Lo” is devastatingly personal and utterly gorgeous. Lo’s eleven songs, written entirely by Cole, navigate her opening to trust again after indelible blows of life. As the first woman to ever be nominated for the Best Producer Grammy in her own right, Paula Cole returns to the helm of recording as sole producer. “Lo” was recorded entirely live, featuring full band performances from Jay Bellerose (drums), Chris Bruce (guitars), Ross Gallagher (upright and electric bass, backing vocals) and Rich Hinman (pedal steel, guitars). It was recorded and mixed by nine-time-Grammy-award-winning-engineer, Mike Piersante, whose unique sound is the canvas for “Lo.”

Morley is a singer, producer and composer who weaves the threads of jazz, soul, and global-folk traditions into a singular tapestry of vocal and acoustic splendor – the sound wave or a life lived with uncommon devotion to human rights and environmental justice. Last year Morley released a globally conscious children/family album, Story of the Sky with her husband, Chris Bruce, under the name, “The Bruces.”
