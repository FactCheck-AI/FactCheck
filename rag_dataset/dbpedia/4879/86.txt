Shudder has acquired the survival thriller Quicksand from Altitude Film Sales for the US, UK and Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

The English-language film shot entirely in Bogota, Colombia, and will premiere on the service on June 23 and stream on AMC+ in the US, Australia and New Zealand.

Carolina Gaitán (Encanto, Narcos) and Allan Hawco (Jack Ryan, Republic Of Doyle) star in the story of an American couple on the brink of divorce who travel to Colombia for a work conference.

While on a hike through the rainforest they become trapped in a pit of quicksand and must battle the elements including a venomous snake in order to escape.

Andrés Beltrán (Tarumama, Malayerba) directed from a screenplay by Matt Pitts (Westworld).

The production from Sangre Films, a joint venture between Colombia’s Elemental Stories and US companies 222 Pictures and Dawn’s Light Movies, was produced by Jason Cherubini, Nicolás Reyes, and Sean Patrick Burke. Richard Switzer, Martin Ramos, John Harris and Kris Meyer served as executive producers.

Emily Gotto negotiated the deal on behalf of Shudder with Altitude Film Sales’ Mike Runagall on behalf of the filmmakers.
