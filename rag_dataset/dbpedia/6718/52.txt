BUSINESSWOMAN Deborah Meaden is one of the "dragons" in BBC's Dragons' Den.

At the age of 20, when she was just out of Brighton Business School, she launched her own glass and ceramics import company with very little capital. After that, she set up one of the first franchises in Britain of Italian group Stefanel.

In 1999, with several successful businesses in the leisure and retail sector under her belt, she became managing director of her family's holiday park business, Weststar Holidays, though she recently sold it for more than Â£80m.

Meaden, 47, lives with her husband Paul in Somerset.
