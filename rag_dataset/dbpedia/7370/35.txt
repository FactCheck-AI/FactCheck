During his four seasons with the Minnesota Vikings, running back Dalvin Cook has accomplished a lot on the football field. Today, however, he accomplished something even bigger off of it.

Yes, RB1 is now, officially, a college graduate. He participated in his graduation from Florida State virtually, having earned his Bachelor’s Degree in interdisciplinary studies and public policy.

Cook enrolled at Florida State in 2014 and left after three seasons to enter the NFL Draft in 2017. He finished things up in 2021, seven years after first getting to campus in Tallahassee. Speaking from experience, I can tell you that there’s definitely no shame in taking that long to get things finished. After all, as one great American philosopher once noted, “You know, a lot of people go to college for seven years.”

All joking aside, however, congratulations to Dalvin Cook on completing his degree at Florida State University. I’m sure it feels pretty darn good for him to finally get it over and done with.
