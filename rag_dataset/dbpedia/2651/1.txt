List of Namibian endemic species

At least 3870 species are known to occur exclusively in Namibia, and nowhere else on earth. It is our, and only our, responsibility to ensure their survival. Every citizen is compelled by Article 95 of the Namibian Constitution to do so.

The list below includes those species that have, according to the best available information, been recorded only from within the borders of Namibia. There are also many species that occur mainly but not exclusively within Namibia, ranging marginally into neighbouring territories as well. The latter are called near-endemics, and are listed as such in the main database, but are not currently included in this list for practical reasons: the objective and consistent treatment of near-endemics requires near-complete biodiversity information for the neighbour as well, and this is lacking in many groups.

For species that occur close to international borders, including all that are currently known only from the Caprivi, endemism status may change if and when new information from neigbouring countries becomes available. The list below is automatically updated when such changes are incorporated in the main database, so it is best to always download the most recent version. The latest change to the list was on: 2024-09-01.
