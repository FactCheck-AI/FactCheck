Substituted pyrimidinium compounds and derivatives for combating animal pests

The present invention relates to insecticidal substituted pyrimidinium compounds and/or to the compositions comprising such compounds for combating invertebrate pests. The invention also relates to pesticidal methods, to uses and to applications of substituted pyrimidinium compounds as described in the present invention and the stereoisomers, salts, tautomers and N- oxides thereof as well as compositions comprising them.

Invertebrate pests and in particular insects, arthropods and nematodes destroy growing and harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, thereby causing large economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating invertebrate pests such as insects, arachnids and nematodes. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds having a good pesticidal activity and showing a broad activity spectrum against a large number of different invertebrate pests, especially against difficult to control insects, arachnids and nematodes.

It has been found that these objectives can be achieved by substituted pyrimidinium compounds of the general formula (I), as defined below, including their stereoisomers, their salts, in particular their agriculturally or veterinary acceptable salts, their tautomers and their N-oxides. Therefore, in a first aspect the present invention provides substituted pyrimidinium compounds of formula (I) or a composition comprising at least one substituted pyrimidinium compound of formula (I)

Compounds like P-3 are available from the corresponding lactams P-5 by standard procedures known to a person skilled in the art. For example see Allen, Jennifer Rebecca et al in WO 2004/094382 or Lang, Kai et al, Journal of Organic Chemistry, 75(19), 6424-6435; 2010

Lactams are widespread in organic chemistry and methods to produce them are well known. For example see: Smith, M. B. in Science of Synthesis, (2005) 21 , 653.

If individual compounds cannot be prepared via the above described routes, they can be prepared by derivatization of other compounds of formula (I) or by customary modifications of the synthesis routes described.

For example, in individual cases, certain compounds of formula (I) can advantageously be prepared from other compounds of formula (I) by derivatization, e.g. by ester hydrolysis, amidation, esterification, ether cleavage, olefination, reduction, oxidation and the like, or by customary modifications of the synthesis routes described.

The reaction mixtures are worked up in the customary manner, for example by mixing with water, separating the phases, and, if appropriate, purifying the crude products by chromatography, for example on alumina or silica gel.

As used herein, the term "compound(s) of the present invention" or "compound(s) according to the invention" refers to the compound(s) of formula (I) as defined above, which are also referred to as "compound(s) of formula I" or "compound(s) I" or "formula I compound(s)", and includes their salts, tautomers, stereoisomers, and N-oxides.

Mixtures

The present invention also relates to a mixture of at least one compound of the present invention with at least one mixing partner as defined herein after. Preferred are binary mixtures of one compound of the present invention as component I with one mixing partner as defined herein after as component II. Preferred weight ratios for such binary mixtures are from 5000:1 to 1 :5000, preferably from 1000:1 to 1 :1000, more preferably from 100:1 to 1 :100, particularly pref- erably from 10:1 to 1 :10. In such binary mixtures, components I and II may be used in equal amounts, or an excess of component I, or an excess of component II may be used.

Mixing partners can be selected from pesticides, in particular insecticides, nematicides, and acaricides, fungicides, herbicides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, and the like. Preferred mixing partners are insecticides, nematicides and fungicides.
