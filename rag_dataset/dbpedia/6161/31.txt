In today's world, regardless of industry, proper network performance is critical. That's why Paessler PRTG (formerly known as Paessler Router Traffic Grapher) has created a powerful network monitoring tool to help network administrators track the performance, availability and security of their IT, OT, IoT and IIoT infrastructures.

Paessler PRTG monitors all available systems, devices, traffic and applications. It also monitors LANs, WANs, servers and websites, applications and services. The software has integrated network technologies: Ping, SNMP, WMI, SSH, HTTP requests and IPFIX, jFlow, sFlow, NetFlow protocols, automatically detects networks, allows faster configuration with intelligent detection of all devices on the network

We have the ability to fully visualize the network in the form of maps or dashboards. Maps are generated in real time with current device status information and using PRTG's map designer, we can create helpful dashboards. PRTG notifies the administrator in case of any problems or unusual indicators, we can use built-in notification methods (email, push, HTTP requests and others), or we have the option to set custom monitoring parameters. We have our highly customizable reports and report templates in a centralized, easy-to-read control panel. In addition, we can use the PRTG app on a computer or mobile device running iOS and Android.
