We would like to monitor a few of our websites to make sure users can get to the login page. Can this be done? How?

Thanks,

Wes

Probably the easiest way is via Google Analytics .

Easy to setup and use … and it is free.

I hope this helps!

Thanks I will look at that. We currently use IPCheck, but I was wondering if SW could do this as well. So we could get down to one interface for managing everything.

Free software called PRTG Network monitor, www.paessler.com

Free version can monitor 10 sensors. It is pretty simple to install and can notify you via email/pager/etc if the website is unavailable.

Spiceworks isn’t a realtime network monitoring animal.

Thanks,

We use IPCheck now. But you answered my question best, SW is not able to do this.

We were wondering just so we could get all management down to one interface.
