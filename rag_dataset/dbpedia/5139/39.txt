The New York Yankees don't allow names on the back of their jerseys, but they will allow something else besides the interlocking NY and their iconic pinstripes going forward.

The team on Wednesday announced a deal with Starr Insurance that will put the company's logo on a uniform sleeve patch, which the team will wear for both home and away games as the Yankees' new "signature partner."

The first appearance of the new patch will come when the Yanks host the Kansas City Royals on July 21 to kick off their first home series of the season's second half.

The sponsorship deal is expected to net the Yankees at least $20 million per year.

The team's relationship with the insurance company began in 2018 will now run through the 2031 season. In addition to the uniform patches, Starr Insurance will have ads on the outfield wall at Yankee Stadium and on both the home and away teams' bullpens.
