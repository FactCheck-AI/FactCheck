Denmark stands at the threshold of a historic transition as Queen Margrethe II, Europe’s longestserving monarch, announced her abdication after a remarkable 52-year reign. The unexpected revelation during her traditional New Year’s Eve address captured the attention of a nation accustomed to her steady presence.

At 83, Queen Margrethe reflects on a reign that has been marked by grace, dedication, and a deep connection with the Danish people. Her decision to step down on 14 January symbolises a poignant passing of the torch to Crown Prince Frederik, the eldest son who will inherit the responsibility of leading Denmark into its next chapter.
