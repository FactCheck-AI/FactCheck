The Northwest Arkansas Council’s workforce housing center on June 21 will host its third session in its FutureIsNow speaker series at Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art of Bentonville.

The session will feature a panel of community activists, city officials and a representative from the 11th Street Bridge Park in Washington D.C., the city’s first elevated public park.

The bridge park will connect the Washington Navy Yard and Anacostia and provide playgrounds, outdoor performance spaces, educational centers, public art and kayak and canoe launches. The park is expected to open in 2025.

The event will mediate conversations over the decade’s worth of work and collaboration to curb displacement in the Anacostia Neighborhood prior to the construction of the park. Megan Kimble, a New York Times reporter who authored a feature story on the subject, will moderate.

Along with Kimble, speakers for the session include: Scott Kratz, senior vice president of Building Bridges Across the River and director of 11th Street Bridge Park; Kymore Freeman, co-owner of WeAct Radio; Vaugn Perry, director of Skyland Workforce Center and Ward 8 resident; and Harriet Tregoning, director of the New Urban Mobility alliance (NUMO) and former director of the D.C. Office of Planning.
