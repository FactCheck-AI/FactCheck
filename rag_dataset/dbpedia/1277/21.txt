Big surprise at Concord Iasi Open! The main favorite, eliminated in the round of 16. Four Romanians qualified in the quarters of the doubles event

The 5th edition of the ATP Challenger 100 Concord Iași Open scheduled, on Wednesday, at the Ciric Sports Base, the first four matches of the round of 16 in the singles draw, as well as seven matches of the first round in doubles.

After four of the seeds left the race in the first round, today we had another big surprise.

The main favorite, the Argentine Camilo Ugo Carabelli, ranked 100 ATP, was eliminated in the round of 16 by the French Valentin Royer, world number 204, score 7-6 (3), 6-2, after a match that lasted one hour and 50 minutes .

Royer will play in the quarters with the sixth favorite, the Bolivian Hugo Dellien, the 171st ATP place, the one who defeated the Jordanian Abdullah Shelbayh in minimum sets, score 6-4, 6-4. With the same score, the Spanish Javier Barranco Cosano passed the Ukrainian Vitaliy Sachko.

And Argentina's Juan Pablo Ficovich advances to the quarterfinals, after a three-set victory over Russia's Bogdan Bobrov, who came from the qualifiers, score 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Until the eighth, Bobrov eliminated the Romanian players Matei Onofrei, Dan Tomescu and Filip Jianu.

In the quarters, Ficovich will meet the Spaniard Cosano.

Four Romanians in the quarters of the doubles event

Also on Wednesday, the last seven matches of the first round of the doubles were played, in which five Romanian players were trained.

Matei Onofrei from Iași qualified for the quarters together with Tomas Lipovsek Puches from Argentina, the two benefiting from the abandonment of the favorite pair 3 formed by the Frenchman Jonathan Eysseric and the American George Goldhoff, after only one game (1-0).

Alexandru Jecan also qualified for the quarterfinals, together with Polish Szymon Walkow, after 6-2, 7-6 (3) with the couple Dmitry Popko (Kazakhstan) / Aisam-Ul-Haq Qureshi (Pakistan).

Instead, Gabi Boitan and Dan Alexandru Tomescu stopped in the first round, being eliminated by the favorite pair 4 consisting of Poles Karol Drzewiecki and Piotr Matuszewski, score 6-4, 6-3.

Daniel Uță also left the tournament in the first round. The Romanian player, aged only 17, was paired with the experienced Czech Jiri Vesely, 30 years old, and the two succumbed to the pair of Luis Brito (Brazil) / Roy Stepanov (Israel).

Cezar Crețu and Bogdan Pavel also qualified in the quarters of the doubles event on Tuesday.

Cezar Crețu and Gabi Boitan play on Thursday for a place in the quarters

On Thursday, the last four matches of the round of 16 at the Concord Iași Open are scheduled, and the two representatives of our country remaining in the race, Cezar Crețu and Gabi Boitan, will also be on the scoreboard. Both Romanian players eliminated one seed each in the first round.

Cezar Crețu from Iesian, 23 years old, 376th ATP place, will play with Dmitry Popko, from Kazakhstan, 27 years old, world number 222. Last week, Popko contested the final of the ATP Challenger 75 tournament in Brașov, being defeated by the Bolivian Murkel Dellien, 3-6, 5-7.

The Kazakh eliminated in Brașov, among others, Ștefan Paloși (in the round of 16) and Filip Jianu (in the quarterfinals). Crețu stopped in the quarters in Brașov, being eliminated by the Bosnian Nerman Fatic.

For his part, Gabi Adrian Boitan, 24 years old, ATP place 382, ​​will play in the round of 16 with the Spaniard Martin Landaluce, 18 years old, world number 304, a player who is preparing at Rafael Nadal's Academy. Boitan will enter first on "Central", not before 16.30, and after his match Cezar Crețu will play, in the fourth match on the central arena. No Romanian player has reached the quarter-finals stage in Iași in the first 4 editions, so Boitan and Crețu could tick off a first at the Ciric Sports Base on Thursday.

It should be noted that so far 5 favorites have been eliminated at the Concord Iasi Open: the Argentinian Ugo Camilo Carabelli (1), the Spanish Albert Ramos Vinolas (2), the Argentinian Roman Andres Burruchaga (4), the American Nicolas Moreno de Alboran (5) and the Brazilian Gustavo Heide (7).
