Left-back James Husband initially joined Blackpool on a season-long loan from Norwich City in July 2019.

However, the Seasiders moved to make that switch permanent in January 2020, with the former Canary penning an initial 18-month deal.

The defender, who has also played for the likes of Doncaster Rovers, Middlesbrough, Fulham and Huddersfield Town, signed another contract with the Club in the summer of 2021, having played a key part in promotion back to the Championship.
