The Deal

Blackpool announced via their website the defender had signed on a permanent deal. Husband arrives for an undisclosed fee signing an 18-month deal at Bloomfield Road.

The defender’s permanent arrival is Blackpool’s sixth January signing as Simon Grayson looks to ignite Blackpool’s season.

Husband arrived in the summer and has impressed so far. The defender has featured 26 times this season and now joins Blackpool for the long term.

His arrival continues Blackpool’s defensive revamp with several incomings and departures. Michael Nottingham and Nick Anderton have departed while Husband joins Jordan Thorniley and Marc Bola in signing for Blackpool.

Grayson has targeted the Blackpool defence as their weakest point. Their season has dipped due to the number of disappointing goals they concede. Husband will aim to shore up the Tangerines defence.

He could make his first appearance as a permanent player when Blackpool head to Adams Park to face Wycombe Wanderers.

What Was Said

Speaking to the Blackpool website about signing a permanent deal, James Husband said: “I’m delighted to be staying. This is one of the most ambitious clubs in the league and I’m glad to be part of it. Everybody in this club wants to get to the Championship and you’ve seen that ambition with the players that we’ve signed in this window.”

Manager Simon Grayson added: “James has been a consistent performer for us this season and has the experience of playing in a few different positions. The plan has always been to sign him permanently and we’re pleased that we’ve now got the deal done.”
