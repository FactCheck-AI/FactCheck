• Good news from ST Radio Indianapolis, where it was announced that Lenny Diana has signed a new long-term contract extension to continue as Program Director of Triple A 92-3 WTTS. He also remains PD of Alternative sister WGBJ (ALT 99.5/102.5)/Ft. Wayne.

While waiting for the smudge-proof ink to completely dry, Brad Holtz, President of ST Radio, commented, “Since joining ST Radio, Lenny has established a remarkable record, driving WTTS to new rating highs while supporting and working in tandem with our sales team, helping the station achieve all-time revenue records. He’s a strong partner and collaborator, and we are excited to have him on the ST Radio team for years to come.”

Diana joins WTTS in Sept. 2021, following a successful eight-year run as Operations Manager of Saga Classic Rock WAQY & Active Rock WLZX (Lazer 99.3)/Springfield, MA.
