There are some days when all you want to do is go home, put on your comfiest clothes, get your favorite movie-watching spread together, and be alone. It's that treasured time where you have no social obligations and all you have to worry about is getting up to refresh your drink of choice — I'm talking about me time. For most people, me time is sacred, and you can do some of your best movie-watching during it.

It's the perfect way to watch something that either makes you weep like a child, brings out your ugliest laugh, or convinces the musical theater nerd in you that, yes, you could totally have a show on Broadway. It's also the perfect occasion for all your "I-know-this-is-terrible-but-I've-seen-it-five-times-and-I'm-going-for-a-sixth" faves because there's no judgment.

In honor of that sacred solo movie night, here are 51 films that are perfect for watching by yourself. There are romances, comedies, and tear-jerkers galore, but if you're in the mood for something a little darker, we've got you covered with some horror flicks, too.

01

"Do Revenge" (2022)

In this teen revenge comedy, Camila Mendez and Maya Hawke play an ex-high school queen bee and a new girl at school who team up to seek retribution against their enemies on campus.

02

"Bridget Jones's Diary" (2001)

Honestly, you should watch this any chance you get, alone or not.

03

"Sweet Home Alabama" (2002)

I would have had a harder time choosing between Josh Lucas and Patrick Dempsey.

04

"A Cinderella Story" (2004)

Hilary Duff gives a legendary performance in this movie, and we all know it.

05

"Grease" (1978)

Alone time means no one can judge your voice as you sing along to every single song.

06

"Big Fish" (2003)

A perfect blend of whimsy, romance, and heartfelt moments that we could all use.

07

"Love, Rosie" (2014)

Talk about an emotional roller coaster! A film where, even if you knew they would, you couldn't help but wonder if they actually would.

08

"Just Wright" (2010)

This movie hits all the rom-com spots! Who knew Common would make such an excellent leading man outside of your daydreams?

09

"Meet Joe Black" (1998)

You cannot miss out on young Brad Pitt movies! Look at that face — he's practically a Hollywood fetus.

10

"Practical Magic" (1998)

I'm sure this is already on your list of movies to watch, but just in case you forgot, here it is. It's essential viewing.

11

"Trainwreck" (2015)

We all know one (or are one), and this movie has some amazingly funny scenes. Also, who knew LeBron was such a natural actor?

12

"Two Night Stand" (2014)

This one surprised me. But watch for the love scene during the snowstorm. Worth it.

13

"Bridesmaids" (2011)

You might be thinking, "Wouldn't this be better to watch with a group of friends?" And yes, it is great for that. But it's also great when you're alone and want to laugh obnoxiously loud at every other scene without disturbing other people.

14

"Mr. Right" (2015)

Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell are very weird in this. But somehow, so right.

15

"Bend It Like Beckham" (2002)

If you didn't want to sign up for a soccer team after this, you have a stronger will than I do.

17

"Bad Teacher" (2011)

If you ever meet a teacher like this, call the cops. I don't care if they learn their lesson in the end. Still a good movie though!

18

"How to Be Single" (2016)

This might be a painfully unrealistic depiction of living in New York City, but definitely a top contender for your new guilty pleasure film.

20

"A Walk to Remember" (2002)

Do you still have those tissues nearby? You're gonna need them.

21

"Penelope" (2006)

This movie is so charming you'll add it to your regular roster.

22

"The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" (2005)

I know this is typically a girls' night movie! But sometimes you need to enjoy the classics alone.

23

"Speed" (1994)

If you can't watch Keanu Reeves save a busload of people from a bomb, alone, when can you watch it?

24

"Enough" (2002)

Come through with the stunt work, Jennifer Lopez!

25

"Sisters" (2015)

It's Tina Fey and Amy Poehler throwing a rager. Of course you're watching this!

26

"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" (2003)

Never forget the love fern.

27

"Spy" (2015)

Melissa McCarthy never fails to make me laugh.

29

"Wreck-It Ralph" (2012)

A movie about a video game villain trying to find love and learning to accept himself as he is? Bring out the tissues AGAIN.

30

"Pleasantville" (1998)

A classic movie that is sure to bring some color into your drab night.

31

"The Wedding Planner" (2001)

I know you know how good this movie is. There's no reason to deny it when you're home alone!

32

"Clueless" (1995)

As if I was leaving this out!

33

"Two Weeks Notice" (2002)

How is Hugh Grant so charmingly inept in this film ?

34

"The Last Five Years" (2014)

One question: Where is Anna Kendrick's Oscar for breaking my heart in this film!?

35

"Crazy, Stupid, Love." (2011)

Somehow, this movie has everything anyone has ever wanted in a rom-com . . . including Ryan Gosling's washboard abs.

36

"Step Up" (2006)

Okay, this might be a hard watch given the circumstances. But a classic is still a classic and "Step Up" is too good to never watch again!

37

"Step Up 2: The Streets" (2008)

Yes we already have "Step Up" listed, but the sequel is also pretty damn good and worth the watch. For a real treat, watch it back-to-back!

38

"Stardust" (2007)

If you like "The Princess Bride," or just have great taste in movies, you'll love "Stardust." You might even want to share it with your friends.

39

"Transformers" (2007)

Sometimes, you just want to watch robots fight. No shame.

40

"Sleeping with Other People" (2015)

This is not your typical "friend zone" movie. Alison Brie and Jason Sudeikis play terrible people who you can't help but root for.

41

"Bachelorette" (2012)

There are so many amazing actresses in this movie, which helps make it such a gem. Weddings should not be this complicated in real life.

42

"Lars and the Real Girl" (2007)

This is an amazing movie and everyone should watch it alone at least TWICE. At least.

43

"What's Your Number?" (2011)

Anna Faris is rom-com perfection! She is a true comedian and is never afraid to go there, which is a perfect combo with a very cheeky, Chris Evans.

44

"Up" (2009)

Get ready to sob, because you're definitely watching this tear-jerker!

45

"Chef" (2014)

Do you like food and Sofia Vergara? Then you'll love "Chef"!

46

"The Boss" (2016)

This comedy is both ridiculous and heartwarming AF. Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Bell are an unbeatable combination!

47

"The Other Woman" (2014)

Who doesn't love a movie about women coming together to get back at the man who hurt them?

48

"This Is 40" (2012)

I mean. Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd. Need I say more?

49

"About Last Night" (2014)

Can Kevin Hart and Regina Hall always be in movies together? Just wondering.

50

"The Five-Year Engagement" (2012)

Jason Segel and Emily Blunt are so magic in this! They manage awkward-yet-endearing really, really well.
