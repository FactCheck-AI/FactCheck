Taylor County is Florida's 34th county, established on December 23, 1856, from a segment of Madison County. It gains its name from Zachary Taylor, the 12th President of the United States (1849-1850), who commanded forces during the Second Seminole War. Perry, originally called Rosehead by Native Americans and then later (1875) renamed Perrytown after Governor Stark Perry, is the county seat.
