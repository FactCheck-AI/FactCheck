Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk publicly harangued Democrats involved with the headline-grabbing, devastatingly detailed CIA torture report on Wednesday, calling them "little zombies" out for Republican blood.

Kirk, a Republican with a decorated military background, told WLS-AM radio hosts Mary Ann Ahern (of NBC Chicago) and John Kass (of the Trib) that he believes the Democratic-controlled Senate Intelligence Committee "pushed this because they're about to lose their jobs 'cause the American people picked a Republican majority in the last election."

"They wanted so desperately to be relevant and they reached up from the political grave, like (Secretary of State John) Kerry, to do this harm to our troops overseas," Kirk said in the interview.

Waving a finger at California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Kirk lamented: "We may lose a couple of Americans in uniform on the front line in Afghanistan because of this incredible selfish act by Feinstein's staff."

Feinstein's rep. denied the allegations, saying, "This is character assassination and as far from the truth as can be."

The 600-page Senate report released Tuesday called into question the efficacy of harsh post-Sept. 11 interrogation methods against suspected terrorists. The gritty revelations, dominating media headlines, have won Democrats' praise and polarized lawmakers inside the Republican Party.

"The truth is sometimes a hard pill to swallow," stated Sen. John McCain, who was tortured as a P.O.W. during the Vietnam War. "It sometimes causes us difficulties at home and abroad. It is sometimes used by our enemies in attempts to hurt us. But the American people are entitled to it, nonetheless."
