ST.GEORGE (GREEK ORTHODOX)

The Greek Orthodox Church of St. George was erected upon the northern tower of the Fortress of Babylon and echoes its round shape. The church can be reached through a flight of stairs and is crowned by an impressive dome. Tradition has it that St. George was kept in a prison close to the church and martyred there. The present building dates from the beginning of the 20th century.
