The Good Times

The Good Times are here. The band recorded some tunes earlier in the summer and you can listen to them on their myspace. It’s a rock’n’roll/beat band which play lot of fantastic cover songs. Some you know by heart and some you might not have heard at all. Like The Beatles in Hamburg was one of the ideas flying around when they were forming the group.

Petty Crimes

Petty Crimes is a new band led by Damn Seagulls frontman Lauri Eloranta. Petty Crimes’ garage rock is a lot rougher than you might expect if you’ve gotten used to Damn Seagulls’ almost stadium friendly sound but it does sound equally brilliant. Actually this might even sound better to the hardcore indie geeks. I love ’em both.
