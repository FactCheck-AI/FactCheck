The oldest fossils of class Actinopterygii, or ray-finned fishes, date to the Devonian period. By the late Paleozoic Era they had become the dominant vertebrates living in marine environments. The group to which nearly all extant Actinopterygians belong, the Teleosts (Subclass Neopterygii, Infraclass Teleostei), appeared in the late Triassic period. By the start of the Cenozoic Era, following the great extinction event concluding the Cretaceous, the teleosts dominated marine and aquatic environments worldwide.
