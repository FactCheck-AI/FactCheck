Hungarian athletes won eight gold, three silver and four bronze medals at the 31st Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil this August. This tally of medals puts Hungary on 12th place on the medal table of nations – but analysts also point out that the total of 15 medals is the poorest performance for Hungary in the past 80 years after the ten medals (3 gold, 5 silver and 2 bronze) won at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

The most successful member of

the Hungarian team was swimmer Katinka Hosszú who won three gold and a silver

medal by winning the women’s 200- and 400-meter individual medley events (smashing

the world record in the latter) as well as the 100-meter backstroke and finishing

second in the 200-meter backstroke.

Flatwater kayaker Danuta Kozák had her fair

share in three other Olympic victories for Hungary: she won Hungary’s 500th Olympic medal as she defended her individual 500-meter title she won in London

four years ago, she was member (along with Gabriella Szabó, Tamara Csipes and

Krisztina Fazekas-Zur) of the kayak-four team that also defended their London

Olympic title at 500 meters and she – paired with Gabriella Szabó – also won

the kayak-double 500-meter event in the Rodrigo de Freitas Laguna in Rio de

Janeiro.

The third sports that produced

gold medals for Hungary was fencing. First, Emese Szász crowned her career by beating

Italian Rossella Fiamingo in the women's individual epée final and then, Áron

Szilágyi defeated Daryl Homer of the United States to defend the saber title he

won four years ago in London.

Apart from Hosszú, swimmer László Cseh (men’s

100-meter butterfly) and fencer Géza Imre (men’s individual epée) also finished

second while the Hungarian bronze medalists in Rio included field athlete Anita

Márton (women’s shot put), swimmer Tamás Kenderesi (men’s 200-meter butterfly),

swimmer Boglárka Kapás (women’s 800-meter freestyle) and the men’s epée fencing

team.
