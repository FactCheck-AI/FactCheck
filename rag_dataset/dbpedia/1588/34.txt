Agile software development course curriculum

By learning Agile with a Agile software development course, you may explore topics such as:

Agile software development methodology: Courses covering this topic may open with an overview of the historical need for Agile software development and its core principles as outlined in the Agile Manifesto.Â

Frameworks: There are many Agile implementations known as âframeworksâ, including Scrum and Kanban. Understanding the distinctions and value of each framework will prepare developers to be more dynamic in real development settings.Â

Agile tools and techniques: Agile tools aid developers with procedures like building cumulative flow diagrams and mapping value streams.Footnote 2 These help Agile developers quickly overcome emerging challenges.

Project management: Project management techniques empower developers to deftly oversee every aspect of their project. Courses covering this topic may teach foundational project management concepts and unpack more general leadership skills like empathy, collaboration, and mentorship.

After completing an Agile course, learners should have a better understanding of Agile software development and be more prepared for many software roles. edX offers a variety of classes and learning options to help new and experienced developers learn Agile and other valuable technology skills that can benefit their career. From boot camps to self-guided courses, choose the offering that best suits your schedule and career goals.

Explore Agile software development jobs

One of the key benefits of Agile software development is that its methodologies are applicable in a variety of professional contexts. By learning Agile concepts, you can begin exploring several Agile software development jobs. These include:

Agile coach: These consulting experts leverage knowledge of Agile software development methods and the Agile software development life cycle to help companies, teams, and individuals exercise sharper, more Agile workflows.Footnote 3

Software engineer: Many modern organizations seek developers who can hit the ground running, so software engineers who embody Agile development values may be ideal candidates for certain employers.

DevOps engineer: These professionals develop and deploy software that adheres to DevOps principles. Key among these practices are collaboration and rapid feedbacking, both of which are Agile software development processes.Footnote 4

Data scientist: Data scientists use programming, statistics, and mathematics skills to analyze data and provide insights to their organization. Data scientists need to be highly reactive to emerging data, making Agile principles key to their success.Footnote 5

How to use Agile software development methodologies

To succeed in an Agile software development role, youâll need knowledge of many technical topics:

Software design: This skill empowers developers and project leaders to architect their projectâs design and flow before writing any code. Agile software development helps you think more holistically about your projects and in turn makes you more collaborative.

Software as a service (SaaS): This is a subscription model for continually delivering software and software updates to customers. Many Agile frameworks, such as Scrum, depend on this reactive model to consistently meet customer expectations.

Programming languages: Programming languages are the tools of a developerâs trade. The more languages youâre fluent in, the quicker you can adapt to ever-changing circumstances as an Agile developer.

Operating systems: Many organizations develop products in and for different operating systems. The more operating systems youâre comfortable with, the better equipped youâll be to quickly meet your teamâs needs in an Agile setting.

If youâre ready to learn more about Agile software development, consider the different educational options offered through edX. Enroll in a specialized course to develop specific skills, like a coding boot camp, or pursue a full bachelorâs degree or masterâs degree. Find the learning path that aligns with your professional goals.
