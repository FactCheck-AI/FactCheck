Dear Friends,

Welcome to Mercy McAuley High School, an all-girls, Catholic, college-prep high school. Mercy McAuley is a sponsored ministry of the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas and is a member of Mercy Education. As alumnae of Mercy schools, we are proud to serve the Mercy McAuley community in continuing the rich Sisters of Mercy tradition that began in Cincinnati over 100 years ago.

Central to Mercy McAuley's mission are the teachings of the Catholic Church and the Mercy values inspired by Catherine McAuley, the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy. These values are: Compelled by Mercy, Educational Courage, Inspired by Faith, Principled Leadership, and A Voice for Dignity and Respect.

Mercy McAuley's innovative academics focus on empowerment, personalized growth and experiential learning opportunities that leave our graduates well prepared for college. Our curriculum is designed to support and challenge a wide range of academic abilities and interests. In addition, we teach the skills needed to succeed in life: critical thinking, creative problem solving, collaboration, communication and compassion.

In addition to outstanding academics, Mercy McAuley offers a wide range of extracurricular activities. From competitive athletics, to fine arts, to clubs and student organizations - there is truly something for everyone!

We invite you to join us for the many fun events throughout the school year. Visit our website often, and follow our social media sites, to stay connected to all things happening at Mercy McAuley. We can't wait to see you!

Be a Wolf,
