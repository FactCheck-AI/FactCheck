Description

OpenCRAVAT is a module variant annotation tool developed by KarchinLab at Johns Hopkins. This dataset is a mirror of the OpenCRAVAT store available at https://store.opencravat.org. You can configure OpenCRAVAT to use this mirror by editing the "cravat-system.yml" file. The path to this file is in the first output line of the command "oc config system". In that file, change the value of "store_url" to "https://opencravat-store-aws.s3.amazonaws.com".

Update Frequency

Data is mirrored daily. Update frequencies of individual annotators depend on the update schedule of the source data.

License

License varies per-annotator. Commercial users must check the "commercial_warning" field in the module_name.yml file of each annotator.
