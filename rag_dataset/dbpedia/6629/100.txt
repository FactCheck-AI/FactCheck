Gibbs replaces Stengel as Time's managing editor

Time Inc. named Tuesday veteran reporter Nancy Gibbs as the new managing editor of its flagship news magazine.

Gibbs, who was most recently Time's deputy managing editor, succeeds Rick Stengel, who left the magazine to become undersecretary of public diplomacy and public affairs at the State Department.

Gibbs, who is the first woman to be named to the job, has been leading the newsroom while Stengel was pulled from its daily operations six months ago to work on issues related to the upcoming spinoff of Time Inc, a magazine publishing division of Time Warner.

Gibbs has written for the magazine for more than two decades, specializing in politics and writing more cover stories than any other writer in its history.
