Mudvayne is a heavy metal band that is both aesthetically and sonically attention-grabbing. Their morphing fusion of metal-rock influences and a visual aesthetic focused on face coverings and grungy face painting have been the trademark of the band since 1996. Greg Tribbett on guitar (Gurgg), Matthew McDonough on drums (sPaG), Chad Gray on lead vocals (Kud), and Ryan Martinie on bass make up the band (RÃ¼-d).

The band was formed in 1996 in Peoria, Illinois. It would take them some time to record a studio album, which finally occurred in 2000 with "L.D. 50." This album would mark their rise to stardom as it topped the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart. The band explored darker themes on their sophomore album entitled "The End of All Things to Come." The experimentation done on this album paid off when it became one of 2002s well-received metal albums. "Lost and Found" followed suit in 2005. The album's track "Forget to Remember" became part of the Saw II movie soundtrack. "The New Game" (2008) and "Mudvayne" (2009) came out before their hiatus in 2010.

After a decade of hiatus and a recent tour, the band is back on the road again for their "Psychotherapy Sessions" tour. Performing with the band are the rock bands Coal Chamber, Gwar, Nonpoint, and Butcher Babies. Coal Chambers is a nu-metal band with fiery songs such as "Loco" and "Fiend." Gwar is a heavy metal band with rotating members, notable for their outward costumes and songs like "Sick of You" and "Let Us Slay." Nonpoint is a rock band from Florida, popular for the song "What a Day." Representing groove rock, Butcher Babies rose to prominence with songs "Monster Ball" and "Grim Sleeper."
