IFC Films has debuted a brand new official US trailer for Andrea Arnold's Fish Tank, a British indie film that played at numerous film festivals last year, including Cannes and Toronto. I got to see it a few times, starting with Cannes (read my review), where I saw it on the last day of the festival and absolutely loved it. Fish Tank is a contemporary coming-of-age drama about a rebellious teenage girl in England whose life changes when her mom brings home a new guy that she can't decide whether she wants as her dad or her boyfriend. I really hope everyone gives this a chance, it's a fantastic little British flick. Check out the trailer.

Fish Tank is both written and directed by British filmmaker Andrea Arnold, of a few short films including Wasp and the feature Red Road previously. This first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival back in May where it went on to win the Jury Prize. It has also gone on to show at other various film festivals around the world like Edinburgh, Telluride, and Toronto. IFC Films picked it up for distribution in the US last year. They currently have Fish Tank set for a very limited release on January 15th later this month. Go see it!
