Problem

We no longer produce Sentrigo-branded builds. To migrate from Sentrigo-branded Sensors and Servers to Trellix-branded Sensors and Servers, follow the steps below.

Solution

IMPORTANT: You must first upgrade the Server and then the Sensor.

Upgrade the Server:

Stop the Sentrigo-branded Server service.

On Windows, stop the service named Hedgehog:

​Open the Task Manager

Click the Services tab.

Right-click the entry named Hedgehog and select Stop Service.

On Linux, stop the service named sentrigo-server.

​Open a command-line session.

Type /etc/init.d/sentrigo-server stop and press Enter.

Back up the back-end database:

Use your regular DBMS tools to perform the backup.

NOTE: HSQLDB back-end database isn't supported for production environments.

Install the Database Security Standalone Server with an HSQLDB back-end database.

For further instructions, see the "Server Installation" section of the Installation Guide for your release.

IMPORTANT:

Don't start the Database Security Server service.

The final step of the installation process shows a prompt that asks whether you want to start the Database Security Server service. Click No.

Copy the contents of the Sentrigo server custom properties file to the Trellix server custom properties file.

IMPORTANT:

Don't replace the file; instead, copy the content from one file to another.

On Windows:

Open C:\Program Files\Sentrigo\Hedgehog\conf\sentrigo-custom.properties in Notepad.

Select and copy the entire contents of the file.

Open C:\Program Files\McAfee\McAfee Database Security\conf\server-custom.properties in Notepad.

Locate the bottom of the file and paste the copied content into the server-custom.properties file.

Save the file.

On Linux:

Open /usr/local/sentrigo-server/conf/sentrigo-custom.properties in a text editor of your choice.

Select the contents of the file.

Open usr/local/mfe-dbs-server/conf/server-custom.properties.

Locate the bottom of the file and paste the copied contents of sentrigo-custom.properties into the file.

If you're upgrading to Database Security Standalone Server 4.6.6 or higher, you must add another property to the server-custom.properties file.

After the pasted content from the steps above, add the following text:

For a 32-bit architecture:

JRE_HOME=/usr/local/mfe-dbs-server/jre_32

For a 64-bit architecture:

JRE_HOME=/usr/local/mfe-dbs-server/jre_64

Save your changes.

Start the Database Security Server:

On a Windows Server, the service is named McAfeeDBS.

​Open the Task Manager.

Select the Services tab.

Locate the McAfeeDBS Service.

Right-click and click Start Service.

On a Linux server, the service is named mfe-dbs-server.

Open a command-line session.

Type /etc/init.d/mfe-dbs-server start and press End.

Uninstall the Sentrigo-branded Server:

On Windows:

Navigate to Installed Programs.

Highlight Sentrigo Server and click Uninstall.

Click No when you see the prompt:

Note! Selecting 'Yes' removes alerts, configurations, and the entire Hedgehog database. Select 'No' to keep files

On Linux:

Open a command-line session.

Type rpm -e sentrigo-server and press Enter.

Remove the Sentrigo installation directories.

On Windows:

Open File manager.

Navigate to C:\Program Files.

Delete Sentrigo.

On Linux:

Navigate to /usr/local/.

Delete the folder sentrigo-server.

Upgrade the Sensor:

Upgrade your Sensor according to the steps documented in the "Sensor Installation" section of the Database Activity Monitoring Installation Guide for your release.

IMPORTANT: Don't upgrade the Sensor using the .sup files because this method isn't recommended.
