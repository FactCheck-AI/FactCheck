Troubled Minds

'I don't think anyone is exempt from mental illness - it could happen to anybody.' Vickie and Kevin Carey are registered mental nurses.

She works on an open ward in a hospital near Chester while he commutes to the Merseyside Regional

Secure Unit at Rainhill, near Liverpool.

'Empathy rather than sympathy' is what their very varied patients are offered;

Vickie dealing with harassed housewives while Kevin copes with murderers and arsonists. With all the patients, the aim is to help them back into the community and the nurses in these units spend more time walking the streets than the wards.
