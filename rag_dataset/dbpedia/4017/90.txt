Maronite Catholic Mission

Glorifying God

in the footsteps of the prophets, apostles and martyrs

Summer Recess

Because the Mission predominantly serves students, we are in Summer Recess until the opening of the Academic Year in August. We hope to see you then!

Blessed Massabki Martyrs is a Catholic Mission of the Maronite Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon in South Bend, Indiana.

The Syriac Maronite Church of Antioch is one of the twenty four Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the Pope of Rome, and represents one of the many rich spiritual treasures of the Catholic Church.

The Maronite Church is

Catholic

The Maronite Church is the only Eastern Church that has never broken communion with Rome. In its unwavering Catholic faith, Pope Leo X called the Maronite Church: “A rose among thorns, an impregnable rock in the sea, unshaken by the waves and fury of the thundering tempest.”

We pray for the Pope in every liturgy.

Apostolic

The Maronite Church follows the faith of Christ, brought to Antioch by the Apostle Peter, her first bishop. It was at Antioch that the disciples of Christ were first called ‘Christian’ (Acts 11:26).

Syriac

The Maronite Church is part of the West Syriac Tradition, that draws on some of the most ancient customs and rites of Christianity that developed in Jerusalem, Antioch and Edessa. The liturgical language is Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, the language of Jesus.

“Come, let us bow down and worship Him!”

(Ps. 95:6)
