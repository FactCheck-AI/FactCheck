Charlie Chan's Chance (Fox, 1932). Vintage Photo Still (8" X 10").

Warner Oland's third excursion as the Chinese detective, this early talkie features a plot in which Chan himself was the intended victim of a murder, but escaped, while another man was killed. He has to fend off the inquiries of both Scotland Yard and the New York police while he tracks down the killer. Unique in the series as being the only Chan film to have the involvement of creator Earl Derr Biggers (credited with "added suggestions"), this is a lost film, much to the chagrin of many Chan enthusiasts. What's not lost is this original fantastic Stunning Sepia promotional photo still with a terrific image of Oland and his co-stars

Starring Warner Oland, Alexander Kirkland, Ralph Morgan, H.B. Warner, Marian Nixon, Linda Watkins, James Kirkwood, James Todd, and Charles McNaughton. Directed by John G. Blystone. .
