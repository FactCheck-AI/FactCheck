Here's something to consider. Inzamam averages 55 at home opposed to Miandad who averaged 61 in his own backyard. Inzamam played in the era of neutral umpires, Miandad didn't.

Note: In away games, both average 45, making it an even closer contest.

Should have been Inzi by a long way, but certain factors made it close.

Even though I'm more inclined to agree that Inzamam has been the better batsman, I would like to see how you think its by a long way.

It could have been a long way. Inzamam had the talent, the temperament and a touch of the unusual that so often makes a uniquely brilliant player. Without a doubt he is one of the greats of recent times and one of all time for Pakistan, but like so many of Pakistan's recent heroes (or perhaps anti-heroes in some very few cases), he fell short of his potential. I think a lot of us pundits felt he had enough left in him to have made 10,000 Test runs (or close to), if he hung around for a couple of years.

On the other hand, maybe numbers were never a part of his potential. After all, he was the go-to guy to win you a final or set a victorious target. Or if you're in a chase that goes down to the wire, he was that guy who could get you a 1 wicket win.
