Cricket and a Shot at Destiny

Inzamam was no textbook batsman. His technique was unorthodox, a blend of brute power and surprising agility.

He possessed an uncanny ability to read the line and length of a delivery, and his footwork, especially against the spinners, was mesmerizing.

While he could demolish any bowling attack, Inzamam had a particular affinity for playing against India, the matches igniting a ferocious competitive spirit within him.

His numbers speak volumes:

Tests: 120 matches, 8830 runs, an average of 49.60, 25 centuries, 46 half-centuries

ODIs: 378 games, 11739 runs, average of 39.53, 10 centuries, 83 half-centuries

More than just his runs, he brought a sense of stability to a Pakistan team notorious for volatile performances.

Inzamam married Kashifa ul-Haq, and the couple had four children – a son, Ibtasam-ul-Haq, Inaam-ul-Haq, and Aisam-ul-Haq, and a daughter, Ameena-ul-Haq.

His ability to build monumental innings and set Pakistan up for victories became a hallmark of his career.

Captaincy and a Legacy Cemented

In 2003, Inzamam was handed the captaincy. While his leadership style was sometimes questioned, he led Pakistan to numerous victories, notably the Test series triumph over India in 2005.

His legacy as a batsman was cemented when he surpassed Javed Miandad to become Pakistan’s highest Test run-scorer.

Despite the accolades, Inzamam faced controversy. His running between wickets was often comically poor, and there were times when his temper and outbursts created tense moments.

But through it all, he remained a beloved figure for fans across the world.

Retirement and Beyond

In 2007, under somewhat acrimonious circumstances, Inzamam retired from international cricket. He dabbled in the Indian Cricket League before taking on roles in coaching and selection.

In 2016, he briefly served as the chief selector for the Pakistan cricket team. Though he stepped down in 2023, his impact on the game continues to be felt.

A Colossus of the Game

Inzamam-ul-Haq wasn’t just a player; he was a symbol of a nation’s passion for cricket. His broad frame, languid walk to the crease, and explosive batting style made him a unique spectacle in the sport.

His statistics confirm his place among the game’s most significant, but it is his aura of unpredictable brilliance that endures in the memories of cricket fans. Inzamam-ul-Haq was, and remains, a colossus of the game.
