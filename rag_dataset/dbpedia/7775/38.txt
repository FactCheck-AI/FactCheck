Painted in the early 1930s, this painting depicts horse racing on the Tel Aviv sea shore, at the mouth of the Yarkon River. Rubin settled in Tel Aviv in 1922 and fell in love with the changing urban scenes of the burgeoning new city. In his biography (H. Gamzu, Rubin, Tel Aviv, 1984, p. 152) Rubin describes the life in Tel Aviv of the period as a "...village market, with temporary housing but a lively population who was interested in the social life of the city and not only in family life. Young people were always singing and dancing in the streets. Boys and girls would meet on the street or on the beach, would link their arms and dance or sing..." (Ibid). The happy atmosphere of those idyllic days echoes in this painting.
