Marcel Van Eeden (Paperback)

Katja Blomberg

Paperback. Condition: new. Paperback. Since the mid 1990s, the Dutch artist Marcel van Eeden (born 1965) has used drawing to attempt to forge a relationship with the world prior to his birth. Based on print media published exclusively before the year 1965, his drawings also weave imaginary celebrities into their narratives, ultimately evolving into a self-contained world from which their author is emphatically absent. This volume surveys his work. Shipping may be from our Sydney, NSW warehouse or from our UK or US warehouse, depending on stock availability. Seller Inventory # 9783865609311
