“Flying A” actress Mary Miles Minter was born on April 25, 1902. The first movie that 14-year-old actress Mary Miles Minter made at the “Flying A” was called “Youth’s Endearing Charm.” The film takes place in an orphanage, and dozens of children from Santa Barbara’s St. Vincent’s Orphanage appeared in the production. (The building is still here at 925 De la Vina Street.)

“A strong attachment sprung up between Mary and the love-starved kiddies, and she was the center of a loving throng every minute of the days the children were working with her. Twice she gave up her luncheon hour so she could take the children for a spin along the beach in her new motor car.” – Motography, July 22, 1916
