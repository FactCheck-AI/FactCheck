Starting situation

Matthias Magnell, responsible for leadership development at Skanska, saw a need for innovation in the company‚Äôs L&D.

Previous stand-alone methods such as workshops and training were no longer up to date, as they were not available ‚Äúon demand‚Äù in everyday life.

As part of the leadership development program, Matthias Magnell was looking for a future-oriented, scalable and cost-effective method for developing soft skills that would support the transfer and embed them in leadership behavior: a measure to drive cultural change within the company.

Goals

Skanska‚Äôs goal was to embed leadership behaviors in everyday work. The skills and competencies of the management team were to be continuously improved, and Matthias Magnell also recognized the potential of scalable coaching for all executives.

Result

Skanska started the transformation journey with an AI Coach with several department heads and middle managers.

Leadership skills in middle management were significantly strengthened by repeatedly reminding executives during AI coaching of what is essential for their current and future roles.

The monthly insights provided by the reports improved leadership skills and led to significant organizational improvements and greater clarity.

The reports highlighted the importance of changes in leadership development, particularly with a focus on purpose and prioritization. They highlighted the need for changes in Skanska‚Äôs support organization to improve overall clarity of responsibilities, roles and coordination capabilities.

They signed the contract to scale AI Coaching to 10,000 people.

Feedback from participants and L&D

‚Äú

These sessions are very suitable for a time of reflection. The questions are designed to encourage thought.

‚Äú

This is just what I needed, and I didn‚Äôt even know that I needed the exercise. üôÇ

I have been pretty overwhelmed with my emotions the past week and didn‚Äôt know how to handle them, but this is like a tutorial for my thought labelling process.

‚Äû

‚Äú

We reached the same level of behavior change with 2 months of AI coaching as we would in 6 months with what we normally do.

‚Äú

We saw the same number of people benefit as we typically see with executive coaching.

That‚Äôs why we signed the contract to scale AI coaching to 10,000 people.
