The official currency in Hungary is the forint - abbreviated to HUF. 1 Forint was previously divided into 100 filler, although filler coins are no longer in circulation.

The Hungarian National Bank is the issuer of the forint, and has been since its introduction in 1946. The introduction of the HUF was one of the most important post-war steps to stabilise the Hungarian economy.

As Hungary is a member of the European Union, the Hungarian governmentâ€™s long-term plan is to replace the forint with the euro; however a set date has not yet been determined for this transition.
