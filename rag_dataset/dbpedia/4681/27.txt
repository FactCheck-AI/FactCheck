My native town is Porayar (Nagapattinum district of Tamil Nadu). But now I am in Karaikal. When I was there in Porayar (1996, 1997), I used to get Only DD National and DD Podhigai in one single channel from DD's terrestrial relay station located in Karaikal.

Apart from that, I used to get around 10 or 15 channels from Sri Lanka. Most of them were in Sinhala and few Tamil and English Channels.

Sakthi TV (Tamil) - Used to re-telecast programs from SUN TV. Later had their own programs and few from Sun TV.

Sirasa TV (Sinhala and part time Hindi)

Channel 1 (English)

Swarnawahini (Sinhala, part time Tamil and part time Hindi) - Used to re-telecast ATN (Hindi) and Raj TV (Tamil) programs. Used to telecast latest Tamil and Hindi movies before Indian channels telecast them.

Rupavahini (Sinhala, Tamil, English)

Rupavahini-I (Sinhala, Tamil, English)

E-TV (English)

and many other Sinhala channels (don't remember the names now )

I still remember listening to "ilangai vanoli (Srilanka 24/7 Tamil Radio)" and their programs were awesome. Even now i sometimes listern to their sooriyan FM for good classical songs.

Also now in south many srilankan tamil FM seems to be available, a few of them are given below,

Alai FM 91.4 MHz

Shakthi FM 103.9 MHz, 104.1 MHz

Sooriyan FM 103.4 MHz, 103.6 MHz

I heard a Chinese Tamil FM with name "Cheena vanoli" broadcasting since 1963.
