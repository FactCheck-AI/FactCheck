Airborne radiometric data are provided here as part of the data release "Airborne magnetic and radiometric survey, Virginia and North Carolina Fall Zone, 2021." This website includes the processed aeroradiometric data (gamma spectrometry for K, U and Th) in an ascii .csv file and geoTIFF images showing the total count values and potassium, thorium, and uranium concentrations. The spectral data are provided in a netcdf file that can be reviewed using any freely available viewer (such as HDFview) or loaded using software or programming languages with netcdf support, such as GSPy for Python (Foks, 2022). The contractor report is available on the parent page. References: Foks, N.L., James, S. R., and Minsely, B. J. 2022. GSPy: Geophysical Data Standard in Python.
