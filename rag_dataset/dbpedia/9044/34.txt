Review by Elaine Haddox

The short:

An award-winning Lebanese singer known as a music icon and described by Oprah Winfrey as “one of the most influential women in the Middle East.”

The long:

Nancy Ajram was born and raised in Lebanon. She debuted her talent at the young age of 12 on a reality TV competition that searched for talented solo musicians. Ajram released her first album at 15 titled “Mihtagalak.” From there, her success only grew and her rise to fame began. While primarily releasing pop music, Nancy also started producing music for children. She is the first and only Middle Eastern woman to be a sponsor for Coca-Cola. Ajram has received over 20 awards and titles and continues to be recognized in the Middle Eastern community as one of the best singers of all time.

To listen or not to listen:

LISTEN!!! Nancy Ajram’s music is very influential and worth listening to. She has music for people of all ages and continues succeeding in the music industry!
