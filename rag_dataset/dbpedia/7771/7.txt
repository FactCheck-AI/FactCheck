Boiler Up! Indiana Governor, Mitch Daniels, is named the next President of Purdue University. As a Boiler alum and a Daniels supporter, I myself am quite excited about the news of our Governor taking over the reins of my alma mater. Daniels has been dubbed an ‘outsider’ in some circles due to the fact that he is not from academia, I personally feel this is his strong point. In the tough economic times we face, a proven leader with a winning track record is exactly what is needed and is in keeping with the Purdue spirit. I know not all Boilers agree on this but regardless of your position it’s time to rally around our new President and Boiler Up!
