Activation and deployment activities

Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, 44th Medical Brigade was constituted in the Regular Army on 30 December 1965 and activated at Fort Sam Houston, Texas on 1 January 1966 for future service in Vietnam. The unit was organized under Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) 8-112E, with an authorized strength of 20 officers and 47 enlisted.[9]

1st Lieutenant Byron L. Evans, a Medical Service Corps (MSC) officer, was the first officer to report to the 44th's headquarters at Fort Sam Houston and assumed command on 7 January 1966. On 25 January, Lieutenant Colonel John W. Hammett, MSC, assumed command. He was succeeded by Colonel Thomas P. Caito, MSC, on 7 February. In Vietnam, Colonel (later Brigadier General) James A. Wier, a Medical Corps (MC) officer, was assigned as Director of Medical Services, 1st Logistical Command on 26 January, and was designated as the Commanding Officer of the 44th Medical Brigade, to join the unit in-country.[9]

Orders for the April movement of the Brigade Headquarters from Fort Sam Houston were issued on 31 January. The unit would be assigned to the United States Army, Pacific upon debarkation. Readiness dates were set at 1 April for equipment and 21 April for personnel.[9]

Personnel for the brigade headquarters reported to Fort Sam Houston throughout January and February. Preparation for overseas movement training was conducted in cooperation with the 67th Medical Group and the United States Army Medical Training Center, Fort Sam Houston-an organization separate and distinct from the Medical Field Service School that was charged with initial entry training of combat medics. The Fort Sam Houston Post Headquarters provided logistical assistance to the 44th to help meet the equipment readiness date. Other activities at Fort Sam Houston included the preparation of Standing Operating Procedures; assembly and packing of supplies, equipment, and administrative and professional references; and arranging transportation.[9]

On 18 March, an advance party from the 44th Medical Brigade, composed of 8 officers and 10 enlisted arrived in Vietnam to establish the Medical Brigade (Provisional), which became a working unit of the Medical Directorate of the 1st Logistical Command. Colonel Caito commanded the advance party en route while Colonel Herbert R. Faust, Veterinary Corps (VC), Staff Veterinarian, remained in Texas to command the main body. On 24 March Colonel Wier assumed command of the Medical Brigade (Provisional) and Colonel Caito became the executive officer.[9]

The main body of the 44th touched down at Tan Son Nhut Airport on 21 April 1966. The Medical Brigade (Provisional) was immediately discontinued while the Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment of the 44th Medical Brigade established its offices and billets at 24/8 Truong Quoc Dung, a group of rented villas in suburban Saigon. The Brigade Headquarters, assigned to the 1st Logistical Command, became operational on 1 May and assumed command and operational control of all medical units assigned to the 1st Logistical Command.[9]

Mission and organization

When the advance party of the 44th arrived in Vietnam in March to establish the Medical Brigade (Provisional), the 1st Logistical Command had command and control of those medical units in country which were not organic to divisions, separate brigades, or similar units. The 43d and 68th Medical Groups were the principal subordinate medical commands within the 1st Logistical Command.[9]

The Medical Directorate, 1st Logistical Command, was staffed to develop, coordinate, and supervise medical plans and operations, medical supply and maintenance policies, medical statistics and records, professional medical and dental activities, preventive medicine, and medical regulating activities.[9]

The Medical Brigade (Provisional) served as a vehicle of transition in transferring the direct command and control of medical support units from the 1st Logistical Command to the 44th Medical Brigade. Colonel Wier continued to direct his staff in the Logistical Command's Medical Directorate while also serving as Brigade Commander.[9]

The mission of the Headquarters, Medical Brigade (Provisional) was to "Provide medical service to the United States Army, Vietnam (USARV) through command and control of operating units of the 1st Logistical Command medical service system; developing; [sic] refine and implement operations; reinforce the medical service of the Army divisions, separate brigades and other units having organic medical support, as required; provide staff and technical supervision over religious activities of assigned and attached units; and perform the overall medical service support operations which include patient evacuation, care and treatment; medical supply and maintenance; and the dental, veterinary, preventive medicine and laboratory services."[9]

The Brigade Commander was to "Direct the medical service of the 1st Logistical Command and as the Medical Director, 1st Logistical Command is responsible to the Commanding General, 1st Logistical Command for the accomplishment of the overall medical service mission."[9]

During the time that the Provisional Brigade was functioning, some of the personnel of the Logistical Command's Medical Directorate were transferred to the Brigade Headquarters; others were transferred elsewhere; and some rotated, so that when the 44th became operational, the only personnel left in the Medical Directorate other than Colonel Wier was a Field Army Support Command (FASCOM) Staff Medical Section, consisting of two plans officers, a supply and maintenance officer, a chief medical non-commissioned officer, a typist and a driver.[9]

The Medical Directorate was physically located at Headquarters, 1st Logistical Command throughout the period, but on 1 October 1966 all functions of the section were absorbed by staff sections of the 44th, and the office at the Logistical Headquarters was retained for liaison purposes only. The supply officer continued working in the Brigade S-4, the assistant plans officer became the S-3 of the 43d Medical Group, while the plans officer, the medical NCO, the typist, and the driver remained at the Logistical Command for liaison.[9]

After the 44th Medical Brigade became operational on 1 May, the mission remained essentially the same as it had been for the Medical Brigade (Provisional). A more detailed account of the mission stated that the Commanding Officer, 44th Medical Brigade, in support of USARV elements, would:[9]

Provide area medical support to units without an assigned organic medical support capability

Provide dental service on an area basis

Provide a system of hospitalization and evacuation

Supervise professional medical services of subordinate units

Exercise custody of medical records and render reports on patients treated

Collect, evaluate, interpret, and consolidate required medical statistical data from assigned or attached units and submit to this headquarters, as required.

Provide technical inspection and maintenance support of medical equipment and supplies

Provide medical supply for US Forces and for designated Free World Military Assistance Forces as directed by the 1st Logistical Command

Provide veterinary food inspection and animal veterinary service

Provide preventive maintenance support

Provide medical laboratory support

Provide medical equipment maintenance and repair facilitation

Support the medical equipment status reporting system

Provide for medical regulation of patients intra-army or as directed by 1st Logistical Command

Provide for the security of personnel, equipment, facilities, and billets of elements of the 1st Logistical Command assigned or attached to the Brigade

The Brigade Commander retained his other role as Medical Director, 1st Logistical Command. The staff organization of the Brigade continued to function along similar lines, though with expanded activities and responsibilities.[9]

Colonel Wier became USARV Surgeon on 10 June 1966. On 13 June 1966 a change of command ceremony was held within the 44th Medical Brigade compound where Colonel Wier turned command of the Brigade over to Colonel Ray L. Miller, MC.[9]

Major Stuart A. Chamblin, Jr., MC, served as Deputy Commander of the Provisional Brigade during the time of its existence. He rotated to the United States in early May and the position remained vacant until 6 June, when Lieutenant Colonel Lewis VanOsdel, MC, became Deputy. After he rotated on 12 September the position remained vacant until Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Miller filled the position on 14 November 1966.[9]

There were 58 medical units in the 1st Logistical Command on 1 January 1966, and 65 under the 44th Medical Brigade when it became operational on 1 May. On 31 December 1966 the Brigade had command and control of 121 units. The veterinary, dental, medical laboratory, and preventive medicine units, the medical depot, and the medical group headquarters were organized directly under the Brigade Headquarters, while the remaining units were organized under the medical groups by geographic area. The overall strength of the Brigade was 3,178 on 1 May 1966 and 7,830 on 31 December.[9]

Air ambulance support

The medical air ambulance helicopter in Vietnam supported combat operations and gave general area medical support for all forces in-country. The secondary mission included delivery of emergency whole blood and medical supplies as well as airliftincg keoy medical personnel (i.e., surgical teams, etc.).[9]

Combat operations were supported by placing one or more air ambulances and ground ambulance support in direct support of the combat troops. The aircraft picked up the wounded, not at an aid station, but at the point of injury. On average the wounded were in a hospital or being treated by a surcical team at a clearing station within thirty minutes. All combat wounded were evacuated by air at least once before being air evacuated out of country.[9]

This led to an operational shift in Vietnam, as medical mobility no longer lay with the treatment facility, but with the evacuation units. This allowed the establishment of more or less fixed medical facilities throughout the country and enabled them to install better equipment and, in turn, provide better care for their patients.[9]

Throughout 1966, the 44th Medical Brigade operated 49 air ambulances, while another 12 were organic to the Air Ambulance Platoon, 15th Medical Battalion, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). The Brigade's air ambulances were organized into two companies. One TOE Medical Company (Air Ambulance), the 498th had 25 aircraft organized into four flight platoons. The second air ambulance company was organized under the 436th Medical Detachment (AC) as company headquarters with four medical detachments (RA) operating under it, variously referred to as the 436th Medical Company (Air Ambulance) or the Air Ambulance Company (Provisional). The 498th had responsibility for air ambulance support of II Corps Tactical Zone and the 436th had responsibility for supporting III and IV Corps Tactical Zones.[9]

In September 1966 air ambulance units received their first in-country shipment of helicopter hoists. These hoists were used to extract patients from inaccessible areas where helicopters could not land, such as deep woods or jungle, mountainsides, water, or small boats.[9]

Medical regulating

The mission of regulating patients from forward areas to hospitals capable of providing definitive care (Forward Aeromedical Evacuation System) became a responsibility of medical groups for the first time after the Brigade became operational. This resulted in the 44th Medical Brigade Medical Regulating Officer (MRO) becoming responsible for overall in-country evacuation. The unusual aspect of this situation was that the Republic of Vietnam (RVN) represented the entire forward area. Medical groups controlled the movement of patients (intra-area) from tactical areas to hospitals in their group. Further movement of patients from one group area to another was coordinated by medical group MROs with the brigade MRO, who maintained overall control in order to ensure proper utilization of all medical facilities. Throughout these transfers, patients never leave the forward area, while in previous conflicts they would move from the forward area to the rear area of the field army. The Tactical Aeromedical Evacuation System began with the transfer of patients from the combat zone (the RVN) to the United States Pacific Command (PACOM) and the Strategic Aeromedical Evacuation System began with the movement of patients from PACOM hospital facilities to those in the Continental United States (CONUS). The latter two phases were directly controlled by the Air Force, which was responsible for aeromedical evacuation. A Far East Joint Medical Regulating Office (FEJMRO) a tri-service organization, maintained the responsibility for designating hospitals in PACOM and CONUS where patients could receive adequate treatment. Only those patients requiring extensive (for example burn cases, major amputations, or paraplegies) were sent to CONUS.[9]

Note 1: In 1950, Congress changed the name of the Army Medical Department (AMEDD) to the Army Medical Service (AMEDS) as part of the Army Organization Act of 1950. In March 1968, at the urging of Army Surgeon General Leonard D. Heaton, then in his ninth year of service as the Surgeon General, Secretary of the Army Stanley R. Resor petitioned Congress to restore the name of the Army Medical Service to the Army Medical Department, and Congress approved the restoration of the Department's name in June 1969.[11]

Relocation of brigade headquarters

With the increased emphasis on moving units from the Saigon-Cholon-Tan Son Nhut area, the brigade headquarters moved from its suburban villas at 24/8 Truong Quoc Dung to buildings 8528-8532 on Long Binh Post. The two-phased move was accomplished during late September 1967. Being in close geographical proximity to Headquarters USARV, and the USARV Surgeon's Office was notably beneficial in time saved and in alleviating communications problems.[10]

Organization of groups and subordinate units

Intergroup and intragroup organization remained essentially stable until the third calendar quarter. On 23 October 1967 the 67th Medical Group became operational and medical facilities in the Saigon area, the extreme western part of III Corps Tactical Zone, and all of IV Corps Tactical Zone were detached from the 68th Medical Group and assigned to the 67th Medical Group. This divided a previously large geographical group into two groups of more workable size and resulted in more effective command and control.[10]

This table reflects changes between 31 December 1966 and 31 December 1967[10]

Personnel

The 222d Personnel Services Company (PSC), an Adjutant General (AG) company with MSC personnel officers assigned in place of AG officers, was assigned to the brigade in February and by 31 March had assumed personnel functions for the brigade including the administrative functions formerly accomplished by the various area support commands. The 222d PSC organized separate teams stationed at each group headquarters and the brigade headquarters, providing area personnel services with centralized personnel records at each team. Although this, in most cases, deprived the unit commanders of ready access to their units' personnel records, the increased standardization of procedures, personnel actions, and personnel management functions greatly outweighed this inconvenience.[10]

On 10 August when the brigade became a major command under Headquarters, USARV, the immediate impact on the S-1 office was the increase in awards processed as a result of increased awards approval authority. This required an increase of personnel to handle the workload, and at the end of 1967 there were 3 enlisted and one officer devoting their full efforts to the awards program.[10]

With the September arrival of the 67th Medical Group and the subsequent division of units located in the III Corps Tactical Zone between the 67th and the 68th Medical Groups, the additional requirement was placed on the 222d Personnel Services Company to provide another personnel team to service the group and attached units. This was accomplished by augmenting the team servicing the 68th Medical Group and having the team serve both groups.[10]

A program to convert some military positions to local civilian hires, known as "Program 5 Civilianization," was initiated in the last quarter of 1967, with implementation scheduled for January 1968. This program converted low-skilled and basic entry MOS spaces in medical TOE units to civilian spaces.[10]

There was a total of 872 civilian Local National personnel employed within units of the brigade at the end of 1967. The majority of these personnel were within the brigade's evacuation hospitals and were being utilized as ward attendants, kitchen personnel and in the clerical fields. More than 90% of the total employed were involved in support of the patient care mission. A number of employees assisted the 9th Medical Laboratory as laboratory assistants while others performed dental assistant jobs within the brigade's dental (KJ) detachments. The Civilian Personnel Directorate for the Republic of Vietnam had numerous training programs in effect to meet the brigade's requirements for skilled jobs.[10]

Plans and operations

The brigade continued to provide Army level medical service in support of the Allied forces in the Republic of Vietnam during 1967 and medical resources increased commensurate with the rising troop strength. Medical service was provided by brigade units on an area basis by field, evacuation and surgical hospitals nearest the area of operation. Evacuation was provided by standby air ambulances within the area of operation. There was a sharp increase in combat operations in Vietnam in 1967. Brigade units were therefore faced with new challenges in providing the required Army level medical service.[10]

These challenges were most capably met. Numerous offensive operations were conducted by allied Army forces that extended from I Corps Tactical Zone in the north to the delta in the south. Each of these operations was supported by brigade units. Several brigade units were relocated to support the fluid tactical situation. An additional mission was given to the brigade in the latter part of 1967. This involved providing hospitalization, medical, and surgical care to Vietnamese civilians wounded as a result of hostile action. Three hundred brigade beds were allocated for Vietnamese civilians to help satisfy this new requirement.[10]

Aeromedical evacuation

At the start of 1967, the brigade had 49 air ambulances in one air ambulance company and four medical detachments (RA) to provide primary evacuation support for US and Free World Military Assistance Forces (FWMAF). Other forces were provided support on an as-available basis, with US and FWMAF receiving priority. The increase in allied troops in Vietnam was not accompanied by an attendant increase in medical aviation resources and the increased evacuation workload placed a strain on the existing aeromedical evacuation resources. Therefore, additional medical aviation units were requested for Vietnam based on projected increases in the US and Free World Military Assistance Forces. Until these added medical aviation units arrived, the increased evacuation requirements were met by a special issue of six helicopters by USARV to augment the medical evacuation capability. The special issue aircraft were assigned to "Dustoff" units according to demonstrated workload requirements. By the end of the year the brigade was performing the aeromedical evacuation mission with two air ambulance companies and eight helicopter ambulance detachments, which represented a doubling of the number of available air ambulances. The additional air ambulance units permitted a greater degree of flexibility in stationing, so as to provide more responsive support. From the widely scattered unit base heliports, individual air ambulances were field sited to increase responsiveness to combat forces engaged in operations. A total of 88,696 patients were evacuated by "Dustoff" units during 1967.[10]

Aircraft maintenance required close attention at all levels of command due to low aircraft availability rates. To provide increased availability, non-divisional aviation units, equivalent in size to the air ambulance company, were augmented with an organic direct support level maintenance capability. In addition, these same units were furnished back-up support from field army level direct support units from the 34th General Support Group. Medical units were not augmented with a direct support level maintenance capability as were the non-medical evacuation units of similar size. Since medical units received support from the same direct support units which were furnishing backup support for the non-medical units, the aircraft availability rate of medical units was less favorable. The medical mission, coupled with the absence of an organic direct support maintenance capability, prompted the aircraft maintenance support units to give "Dustoff" the highest priorities. Every effort was made to meet the Department of the Army goal of 80% aircraft availability but an availability rate of 70% was considered acceptable due to maintenance support limitations.[10]

Many evacuation missions could be accomplished only with the aid of a hoist due to the heavy jungle canopy. Hoist missions, although extremely dangerous and employed only as a last resort, often provided the only opportunity for evacuating the wounded.[10]

Insufficient hoists were introduced into Vietnam and the attendant maintenance difficulties reduced the total number available for "Dustoff" use. Only by shifting operational hoists from unit to unit, as required, were the hoist mission requirements adequately met.[10]

Flying conditions in Vietnam proved to be a great threat to the safety of medical aircraft and crew in 1967 than combat damage resulting from enemy action. Though some accidents were caused by the failure pilots to react properly to a critical condition, the most prevalent causes of serious accidents were weather and poor visibility. Most of the medical pilots were instrument qualified with either a standard Army qualification or a tactical qualification. However, after arriving in Vietnam units did not stress instrument flying proficiency which left the average aviator with a minima1 ability to cope with actual instrument conditions suddenly thrust upon him. Upon recognizing this situation corrective action was taken by the Commanding General, 44th Medical Brigade, requiring every medical aviator to practice instrument flying in conjunction with assigned missions on a monthly basis.[10]

Protective equipment for air crews was in severe shortage in 1967 as a result of additional aviation units being assigned to Vietnam. New stocks of ballistic helmets and chest protectors were not available in Vietnam or in the United States. Consequently, the 44th Medical Brigade redistributed assets throughout all medical aviation units with the guidance that the equipment would be shared by all crew members to the maximum extent.[10]

The nature of tactical operations in Vietnam established that helicopter ambulance detachments were more suitable than air ambulance companies for supporting stability operations. The company was too large for centralized operations in Vietnam and the platoons had little or no capability for sustained independent operations. Detachments proved to be much better suited for Vietnam since they were small, capable of sustained independent operations, and could be easily moved from one location to another as the tactical situation dictated.[10]

Medical regulating

Medical regulating in Vietnam was divided into the four distinct phases which had existed since the 44th Medical Brigade arrived in Vietnam in 1966. During 1967 the phases became more distinct because of increased efficiency which resulted from the application of experience to medical regulating and establishing a more definitive in-country aeromedical evacuation system.[10]

Phase I involved the evacuation of patients from the site of injury to the nearest tactical, division level (Echelon/Role II) medical treatment facility.[10]

Phase II overlapped Phase I and included the evacuation of patients from the site of injury or the division forward medical company to the nearest 44th Medical Brigade treatment facility capable of providing necessary and immediate treatment. Contrary to the classical concept of evacuation, this may have been a surgical hospital, field hospital, evacuation hospital (all Echelon/Role III) or field army level clearing company (Echelon/Role II). Medical group Medical Regulating Officers (MROs) located at group headquarters or group forward command posts had the primary responsibility for control of this phase and the primary means of evacuation was usually "Dustoff."[10]

Phase III involved movement of patients to in-country treatment facilities to provide further definitive care, in-country convalescence, or an even distribution of patient workloads. Patients in this category usually had an expected length of hospitalization of less than 30 days. The initial responsibility for Phase III began with the medical group MRO. If evacuation to hospitals of another medical group was required, a request was submitted to the brigade MRO. At that point, the brigade MRO assumed responsibility for Phase III and distributed patient workload to hospitals capable of completing required treatment. The primary means of evacuation was provided by U.S. Air Force fixed-wing aircraft, with "Dustoff" providing some assistance.[10]

Phase IV included evacuation to out of country to United States Pacific Command (PACOM) or continental United States (CONUS) treatment facilities for extended definitive treatment or convalescence in excess of thirty days. Phase IV was the complete responsibility of the Brigade MRO and a change in procedure for out-of-country evacuations was initiated in November 1967. Although the change was referred to as a "new" system, there were no new concepts initiated because the "new" system was existing Army doctrine. It had not, however, previously been applied to aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam.[10]

Prior to the change, patients identified by medical officers for out-of-country evacuation were moved from hospitals to the nearest U.S. Air Force casualty staging facility. There, the patients were regulated through the Far East Joint Medical Regulating Office (FEJMRO) and the PACOM or CONUS destination hospital was obtained and recorded. Brigade and group MROs received an "after the fact" report of the number of patients evacuated out of country.[10]

Major disadvantages included:[10]

Lack of control of out-of-country evacuation by the brigade MRO

Hospitals were not aware of where patients were being transferred, which made follow-up of patients virtually impossible

Casualty staging facilities were completing and closing out clinical records since destination hospitals were not available at the time patients were moved from hospitals to casualty staging facilities

In early November the "new" system was tested and shortly thereafter put into effect. In this system, all hospitals submitted a request to their respective group MROs utilizing formats and diagnosis codes established in current regulations and submitted them to the brigade MRO. Brigade MRO consolidated the group reports and submitted them to the FEJMRO at which time the destination hospital for each patient was provided. This information was passed through groups to the hospitals, the patient's record was closed out, and the patient was prepared for movement to a casualty staging facility and subsequent evacuation out of country.[10]

Initially, there was concern that this system would require excessive time to accomplish administrative requirements and this, in turn, would bog down an already "effective" system. However, it was soon shown that urgent evacuation requests could be processed within an hour, depending on the availability of aircraft. A 36-hour time frame was established for routine requests to provide hospitals with the necessary time for preparation of clinical records and completion of other administrative requirements.[10]

Another problem area involved acquainting personnel with the system to ensure that patients were regulated to facilities capable of providing complete medical care. However, this problem was soon overcome, and the system proved to be very effective.[10]

The major advantages were shown to have been the direct control of out-of-country evacuation by the brigade MRO and that hospitals were now aware of where patients were being transferred. One advantage, not anticipated, was that desirable advance information concerning the number of patients for evacuation was available much sooner for coordination with casualty staging facilities, the Military Airlift Command, and PACOM treatment facilities.[10]

The system passed its most severe test in late November during McArthur, when over 400 patients were effectively evacuated to PACOM treatment facilities.[10]

S-2/historian

The reassignment of the brigade directly under USARV required the brigade to create a full-time office to process and validate security clearances for the brigade's 8,000-plus personnel. Since these tasks had formerly been performed by the 1st Logistical Command, it was necessary for the brigade to establish a new system of records keeping, filing, and clearance processing procedures. The transition to a major division within the S-3 section was completed concurrently the brigade's move to Long Binh Post in late September 1967. At the beginning of October 1967 daily briefings were established by the S-3 for the brigade commanding general and staff. Intelligence summaries then routinely constituted a part of the briefings in which operations, aviation, and bed status reports were also given daily.[10]

The assignment of the brigade historian to the S-2 position resulted in the historical duties also being assigned to that position. The two separate duties, although seemingly incompatible, proved to be quite complementary in their performance.[10]

S-4 activities

By USARV Directive, a Medical Supply Satellization Program was initiated in July 1967. The support of non-divisional units, including separate brigades, battalions, and other units assigned to USARV or MACV, was initially established at the evacuation and field hospital level. It became apparent that this arrangement was insufficient since units were widely scattered throughout RVN. Surgical hospitals, dispensaries, and clearing companies operating medical treatment facilities had to be incorporated into the support effort.[10]

The initial burden of the program was almost overwhelming due to the limited unit level accounting procedures in effect at the time. Limited medical supply staffs were further burdened with completely inadequate stocks from which to support their new customers. There were no standardized supply procedures in effect at the unit level and it became obvious to the brigade staff that without action on their part, units would be unable to support themselves and their satellites.[10]

To correct these problems, the brigade took several actions:[10]

Personal visits were made to all units in the command to analyze the problem

A comprehensive study was prepared, submitted and approved by the brigade commander which outlined the major deficiencies and proposed solutions to the problems at hand

Interim directives were developed and published on Materiel Accounting and Control Implementation, for use at all levels

With the concurrence of the UUSARV G-3 and G-4, stockage levels of the hospitals were established at levels authorized for direct support units

Recognition of additional warehouse and storage requirements for hospitals was obtained and entered in the MACV construction criteria

Supply Information Letters were initiated to provide information to the field

Supply shortages were monitored at the group and brigade levels in conjunction with the medical depot and 1st Logistical Command to pinpoint problem areas and effect redistribution

9Excesses were uncovered and returned to the supply system

In conjunction with the theater consultants, outmoded supply controls were eliminated or modified to permit greater flexibility at the hospital commander's level to procure sorely needed medical supplies and equipment

An aggressive control on requisition priorities was implemented which conclusively improved the supply operations.

Group S-4s were required to:

Conduct quarterly meetings with all supply personnel to assist and help clarify problem areas

Make quarterly inspections of their commands using inspection sheets and guidelines furnished by the brigade and require correction of deficiencies

Chief nurse

On 12 March 1967, Lieutenant Colonel Rose V. Straley, Army Nurse Corps (ANC), was assigned to headquarters, 44th Medical Brigade as its first chief nurse. Following the reassignment of the brigade directly under USARV, the offices of the chief nurse, USARV, and the chief nurse of the brigade were merged. Lieutenant Colonel Jennie L. Caylor, the ranking nurse, assumed the duties of brigade chief nurse on 27 September 1967.[10]

1968

Mission and functions

Throughout 1968, the mission of the 44th Medical Brigade was to provide medical service support to United States Army personnel, Free World Military Assistance Forces Personnel, and other categories of personnel as directed, to provide hospitalization, medical and surgical care to Vietnamese civilians injured as a result of hostile action.[13]

The 29 specified functions of the brigade remained unchanged from 1967.[13]

Relocation of brigade headquarters

On 4 October 1968, the 44th Medical Brigade relocated its headquarters, moving from temporary buildings to a permanent building, #5743, located off MacArthur loop on Long Binh Post. All brigade staff sections were consolidated in the new building which provided a considerable increase in office space. The brigade headquarters detachment and enlisted billets remained in buildings #5523 to No. 5525 in the old brigade headquarters area, located approximately 500 meters from the new building.[13]

Organization of groups and subordinate units

A major geographical realignment of medical groups occurred in February 1968 when the 67th Medical Group relocated its headquarters from Bien Hoa in III Corps Tactical Zone (CTZ) to Da Nang and assumed responsibility for medical care in the I CTZ. At the end of the 1968, the majority of 44th Medical Brigade units were deployed by geographical areas under the control of four medical groups: the 67th Medical Group in I CTZ with headquarters in Da Nang, the 55th Medical Group in II CTZ North with headquarters in Qui Nhon, the 43d Medical Group II CTZ South with headquarters in Nha Trang and the 68th Medical Group responsible for medical care in III and IV CTZ with headquarters at Long Binh.[13]

Dental, veterinary, laboratory and preventive medicine units and the medical depot came under direct operational control of the 44th Medical Brigade Headquarters. The arrival of the 522d Medical Detachment (Team AF) (Veterinary Professional Services) in March 1968 provided one command and control element for all brigade veterinary units. With the arrival of the 172d Preventive Medicine Unit in June 1968 the command structure was changed to include two preventive medicine units under direct operational control of the brigade headquarters.[13]

The only other major subordinate unit to relocate during 1968 was the 9th Medical Laboratory which moved from Saigon to Long Binh in November.[13]

At the end of 1968 the 44th Medical Brigade was composed of 169 units. Of those, 42 arrived in-country during 1968.[13]

A sponsorship program for newly arriving units was developed and published as a brigade regulation. The purpose of the program was to ensure that arriving units were integrated into the command with minimum delay and provided necessary support and assistance until they became operational or otherwise self-supporting. The sponsoring unit was required to prepare a plan for support for the incoming unit to include arrival of their advance party, main body, and unit equipment. Because of the emphasis given to detailed advanced planning and command interest, effective coordination was accomplished and units arriving in-country were fully integrated into the brigade and ongoing operations with minimal delay.[13]

S-1

At the beginning of 1968 the S-1 activities of the brigade were limited to officer assignments, awards and decorations, safety program monitoring, and public information liaison with Headquarters, USARV. The primary personnel action agency was the 222d Personnel Services Company located on Long Binh Post, which in turn placed a personnel service team at each medical group head quarters. Personnel records were maintained by each team at the medical group headquarters. Assignment authorization for Medical Corps officers was retained by USARV and accomplished by specialty consultants located at that headquarters. In early 1968 the S-1 Section consisted of an S-1 officer and three branch chiefs: Officer Personnel Branch, Awards Branch, and Manpower Control. Safety reporting was the responsibility of the Chief, Awards Branch, while the Chief of Officer Personnel handled Public Information Officer (PIO) activities. All enlisted assignments and requisitions were made by the 222d Personnel Services Company.[13]

Numerous changes were made during the year which resulted in a complete overhaul of the missions and functions as well as the physical organization of the S-1 Section. In March 1968 the S-1 Section was reorganized to perform the seven basic functions outlined in FM 101-5, "Staff Organization and Operations," as follows:[13]

Maintenance of unit strength including policy, procedures, and strength reporting

Personnel management

Manpower control

Development and maintenance of morale

Discipline, law, and order

Headquarters management

Miscellaneous

In order to fully implement the functions described above, an enlisted branch was organized, a requirement for MOS inventories instituted, and staff management of enlisted personnel in such areas as distribution, promotion, monitoring of MOS progression, and infusions was instituted. Additionally, a separate PIO Branch was established and information specialists requisitioned to meet brigade information requirements.[13]

Affecting S-1 operations significantly in 1968 were the following notable events:[13]

22 March—Establishment of the Enlisted Personnel Branch

1 April—Imposition of a 200-space cut by USARV

1 May—Establishment of Program Six civilianization with a loss of 317 military spaces and gain of 476 local hire (Vietnamese) spaces

June—Review of strength accounting procedures

1 June—Implementation of centralized orders system

15 August—Formation of Morale and Welfare Branch with full time emphasis on safety, awards, and special services

7 September—Establishment of full-time PIO Section

10 October—Graduation of the first US trained civilian medical corpsman through training program conducted by the 68th Medical Group

8 November—Implementation of an additional manning level (MOS) drawdown of 493 enlisted spaces

In early April a review of enlisted promotion procedures was required by inspector general complaints. This review resulted in a complete revision of promotion procedures and the brigade's internal management system.[13]

Major activities in the Manpower Branch during 1968 were related to a series of personnel cuts instituted by the Department of the Army and USARV levels. The first or these cuts, a civilianization plan call "Program Six", was initiated in January 1968. This plan called for a loss of 317 military spaces and their replacement by 476 locally hired and trained Vietnamese civilians. A temporary deferment was required during the Tet Offensive period, but in May the program resumed with a scheduled completion date of May 1969.[13]

In selecting the positions to be converted, the following criteria were used:[13]

No replacement of personnel higher than grade E-3

Lowest skill MOS were replaced

Replacement personnel in labor-type positions were utilized

Clearing companies and surgical hospitals, because of their mission requirements and possibility of deployment were not levied

In April the Phase I Program was instituted involving a cut of two hundred spaces, followed in November by the Phase II reduction of two hundred additional spaces. The final development in this area was a loss of 493 spaces in a November MOS drawdown.[13]

The strength of the command as of l January 1968 was 8,860 assigned personnel. The end of the year assigned strength was 10,468.[13]

(Note 1) This represents an increase in authorizations of 775 officers, 60 warrant officers and 1,761 enlisted for a total increase of 2,496 military spaces during the year.

A special emphasis area during 1968 was the hiring of Vietnamese civilians. As of 31 December, 1,280 civilians were being utilized throughout the brigade. Included in their tasks were such jobs as clerks, ambulance orderlies, kitchen police, mechanics' helpers, warehousemen, preventive medicine helpers and veterinary assistants. In furtherance of this program a medical training class was established on 21 October 1968 by the 68th Medical Group. Based on the Fort Sam Houston Medical Training Center's 91A program, this eight-week series of classes followed by two weeks on-the-job training prepared Vietnamese workers for jobs previously held exclusively by relatively low-skilled U.S. military personnel. The first class of thirty-three students graduated on 21 December 1968 and would be followed by a second group in early 1969.[13]

On 1 October 1968 a new system for Medical Corps officers was implemented. Previously, all medical corps officers had been assigned directly to brigade units by the USARV Surgeon's office. Transfers could not be made within the medical groups without approval from both the brigade and the surgeon's office. To correct the shortcomings of this situation, the brigade commander, General Neel, directed that all Medical Corps officers would be assigned only to group level and that each group commander would determine the specific unit of assignment. The authority to reassign officers between groups and to make initial group assignments was retained by the Commanding General, 44th Medical Brigade. This new policy greatly increased the flexibility of both the group and the brigade by allowing for the rapid relocation of Medical Corps officer resources to meet changing tactical situations. Under the old system it was possible for transfers to be delayed as long as seven days; however, under the new system, relocation could be accomplished within 24 hours. The assignment of personnel in other Medical Department branches were not affected by these changes.[13]

On 1 December 1968, using the computer capabilities of the 222d Personnel Services Company, the Officer's Branch established a card file for better control of Medical Corps officers. Two sets of cards were maintained in the file: one set filed to show the resources of each medical unit and the other filed according to MOS. As a result, the brigade headquarters was able to present a complete picture of Medical Corps resources both by unit and MOS. This system greatly enhanced the management of Medical Corps officer resources by enabling the brigade commander to determine immediately the status of any given Medical Corps MOS in the brigade and to determine the specialties available at any given hospital. Files were constantly updated by maintaining a flow of input to the system showing changes in duty, MOS, or assignment.[13]

The most significant enlisted personnel developments during 1968 concerned alterations in the enlisted promotion system resulting from changes 21 and 23 to AR 600-200 and the beginning of the E-8 and E-9 centralized promotion system.[13]

The arrival in-country of eleven reserve units during 1968 created a significant infusion problem for the brigade. However, the infusion was well on its way to being completed at year's end and the brigade as a whole was well infused. While individual units may have faced local infusion problems, the means for overall infusion were available to the brigade and complete infusion of the units were expected to be accomplished on schedule in 1969.[13]

The Morale and Welfare Branch was organized on 15 August 1968 to establish procedures and policies in the areas of non-appropriated funds, safety, grants, and special services.[13]

Until organization of a separate branch, non-appropriated fund activities were shared as additional duties by the three officers in the S-1 office. Many problems were encountered in these areas, particularly in non-appropriated funds. In August 1968 the brigade had thirty unauthorized other sundry funds, several of which were in serious financial condition. As a first step to correct this situation, command letters of instruction were disseminated to all units directing them either to submit their funds for review and authorization by the brigade headquarters or to dissolve their funds immediately in accordance with established directives and regulations. On 28 August 1968 the first other sundry fund in the brigade was approved and by 25 November, twenty-five approved other sundry funds were in operation in facilities from Phu Bi in I Corps to Can Tho in the IV Corps area. The remaining unauthorized funds were liquidated.[13]

The brigade safety program underwent major revisions beginning on 4 September 1968 when strong command emphasis was given to the expeditious reporting of accidents to ensure that adequate corrective actions were taken to prevent recurrences. Through liaison with USARV, many safety handouts and posters were obtained and distributed throughout the brigade as part of a vigorous safety program. In November 1968, follow-up actions were taken during command inspections. Utilizing a brigade safety checklist, particular attention was focused on vehicle, fire, weapons, and water safety.[13]

Having been given awards authority up to the Bronze Star Medal in August 1967, the brigade awards program peaked during 1968. Through the use of streamlined filing and processing procedures, an average of 200 awards per week were processed. These awards ranged from the USARV Certificate of Achievement to a recommended Medal of Honor for Major Patrick Henry Brady.[13]

The 222d Personnel Services company provided personnel support to approximately 165 separate medical units, processing an average of 800-850 individuals in and out of Vietnam each month during 1968. The total number of records maintained at any given time during the year Was slightly less than 10,000. The 222d headquarters at Long Binh Post controlled four separate teams located at Long Binh, Nha Trang, Qui Nhon, and Da Nang. Each team provided support to a medical group plus those separate units reporting directly to brigade headquarters which were located within the area of responsibility of the medical group. The AG section, administrative section, and machine branch, which included a Univac 1005 computer, were also located at Long Binh. Unit strength was as follows:[13]

AuthorizedActual Officer37 Warrant Officer43 Enlisted132193

Close

The increased strength was dictated by the mission and the dispersal of the unit to provide decentralized support.[13]

The commander of the 222d served as Adjutant General for the 44th Medical Brigade. The 222d was commanded and staffed by Medical Service Corpe officers and an Adjutant General Corps (AGC) officer in contrast to other personnel service companies which were usually exclusively staffed by AGC officers. This system enabled young MSC personnel officers an opportunity to gain valuable experience in the personnel field.[13]

In early 1968 the lack of a brigade courier system resulted in a very slow, time-consuming distribution system. For example, distribution required from 20 to 25 days to travel from Da Nang to Long Binh. Additional time was required to return information to the sender. A courier system was instituted in August 1968 which expedited the exchange of information between medical units throughout Vietnam. The timeframe for exchange of information between Da Nang and Long Binh was reduced, in some cases, to three days. Related to this problem was the lack of effective and regular communication with the teams located throughout the country.[13]

S-3 operations

The year 1968 can be divided into three distinct but somewhat overlapping phases. The first part of the year was concerned with a major relocation of medical units into the I Corps Tactical Zone (CTZ). This was followed and accompanied by a large-scale deployment of medical units into Vietnam. The third phase occurred during the latter part of the year when command and staff attention was directed to realignment and refinement of the field army medical service within the Republic of Vietnam.[13]

The first major operational event that occurred during 1968 was the redeployment of major US Army tactical units into I CTZ. This buildup consisted of approximately two divisions plus support troops. In order to provide medical support to these forces, brigade units were relocated into and within I CTZ as follows:[13]

The 67th Medical Group headquarters was moved from Bien Hoa to Da Nang to exercise command and control over brigade units in I CTZ.

The 22d Surgical Hospital was moved from Long Binh to Phu Bai

The 18th Surgical Hospital was moved from Lai Khe to Quang Tri

The 571st Medical Detachment (RA) and the 874th Medical Detachment (RB) were relocated from Nha Trang to Phu Bai

The 500th Medical Detachment (RB) was moved from Long Binh to Da Nang.

The 2dPlatoon, 563d Medical Company (Clearing) was relocated within I CTZ from Chu Lai to Phu Bai

The 4th Advance Platoon (Provisional) 32d Medical Depot was organized in early February and stationed at Phu Bai to provide medical supply throughout I CTZ

The second phase involved the deployment of medical units from the continental United States (CONUS) into the Republic of Vietnam (RVN). In March, five medical units arriving in-country were assigned to the 67th Medical Group. These units were the 95th Evacuation Hospital and the 566th Medical Company (Ambulance) stationed at Da Nang, and the 27th Surgical Hospital, 520th Medical Company (Clearing), and the 238th Medical Detachment (KA) stationed at Chu Lai. By the end of April there were 20 brigade units employed in the I CTZ. To provide dental support for the increased number of troops in I CTZ, the 56th Medical Detachment was relocated from Camp Radcliff (near An Khe) to Phu Bai. During the period or this buildup, medical units subordinate to the 67th Medical Group supported Operation Pegasus in the relief of the siege of Khe Sanh and Operation Delaware in the A Shau Valley. Major army units supported were the 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile), 101st Airborne Division, and the Americal Division.[13]

A second major operational event occurred during the year when major US tactical units were deployed to the Mekong Delta in IV CTZ. In order to provide medical support to the operations of the 9th Infantry Division in IV CTZ, a hospital unit arriving in-country was designated to be stationed in the Delta. This hospital, the 29th Evacuation Hospital, became operational at Can Tho during August 1968 and, together with the 3d Surgical Hospital, already located at Dong Tam, provided hospitalization in the Mekong Delta. The aeromedical capability in this area was doubled with the arrival of the 247th Medical Detachment (RA) at Dong Tam in December, joining the 82d Medical Detachment (RA), which had been stationed at Soc Trang since November 1964. At the end of 1968, the alignment of medical services provided efficient, responsive support to the operations of the U.S. Army and ARVN forces in the IV CTZ.[13]

In the third phase, measures were taken to refine and realign medical services within Vietnam. In order to ensure a more balanced alignment of evacuation and surgical hospitals in I and II CTZs, the following plan was implemented:[13]

The 2d Surgical Hospital would relocate in October 1968 from Chu Lai to Lai Khe

The 312th Evacuation Hospital, a mobilized Army Reserve unit scheduled to arrive in late September would operate the hospital facility at Chu Lai vacated by the 2d Surgical Hospital

The 85th Evacuation Hospital would relocate from Qui Nhon to Phu Bai when facilities became available at the new location

The plan was implemented. During the first week of September the 2d Surgical Hospital was alerted for movement and directed to vacate and release facilities to the incoming reserve evacuation hospital. The 85th Evacuation Hospital was alerted to move to Phu Bai.[13]

Construction of the facilities for the 2d Surgical Hospital at Lai Khe did not proceed in accordance with the original schedule; because of this, the move of the 2d Surgical Hospital to Lai Khe was deferred and a provisional 100 bed hospital was formed at Phu Bai using the personnel resources of the 2d Surgical Hospital. In November 1968, the 85th Evacuation Hospital was moved to Phu Bai. During December the 2d Surgical Hospital moved to Lai Khe and the provisional hospital at Phu Bai was discontinued.[13]

This plan had the following effects:[13]

Provided a surgical hospital in direct support of the 1st Infantry Division at Lai Khe

Provided immediate employment of the arriving 312th Evacuation Hospital in Chu Lai in facilities more suited to an evacuation hospital than a surgical hospital

Reduced the number of evacuation hospitals in Qui Nhon from two to one by moving the 85th Evacuation Hospital to Phu Bai

Permitted the deletion of the 94th Evacuation Hospital from the units programmed to arrive in country

Other significant unit relocations which occurred during 1968 included:[13]

During October, the 9th Medical Laboratory moved from Saigon to Long Binh. This movement was part of the command effort to reduce the U.S. military presence in the Saigon area

In December, the 18th Surgical Hospital was moved within I CTZ from Quang Tri to Camp Evans. This relocation resulted in a more secure location for the hospital as well as improved facilities

Utilization of USAR hospitals for POW care

Two field hospitals (POW) arrived in RVN in October 1968. Both units, the 74th Field Hospital (POW) and the 311th Field Hospital (POW), were USAR hospitals that were called to active duty in May 1968. After a brief acclimatization period, each unit assumed the mission of providing complete medical and surgical care for a 250 bed Prisoner of War (POW) hospital.[13]

The 74th Field Hospital was located at Long Binh and assumed responsibility for medical treatment of prisoners of war in III and IV CTZs. The 311th Field Hospital was divided into two hospital units: the unit in Qui Nhon provided primary medical and surgical care while the unit located in the Phu Thanh Valley served as a convalescent center. These units would be consolidated upon completion of the new hospital facilities in the Phu Thanh Valley.[13]

Prior to the arrival of the field hospitals, the POW hospital mission was accomplished by two clearing companies (TOE 8-128G) The utilization of field hospitals, rather than clear-ng companies, to operate POW hospitalization facilities resulted in certain distinct and inherent advantages. The most obvious advantage was the increased number of beds operated by the field hospitals (250 beds) versus that of the clearing company (160 beds). Additionally, the organic professional capability of the field hospitals permitted these units to expand the POW mission in the areas of surgery, x-ray, pharmacy, and laboratory services. It was further recognized that the Army Nurse Corps officers assigned to the hospitals contributed greatly to the overall reduction in POW patient recovery time. This achievement was primarily due to their supervisory abilities as well as their individual nursing talents.[13]

S-3 plans

In addition to publishing operations plans and orders implementing plans and orders of higher headquarters the 44th Medical Brigade published a plan to support contingencies which would require the brigade to rapidly deploy medical units in support of tactical operations. This plan provided for deployment of various types of units subordinate to the brigade.[13]

Implementing plans were published by each subordinate medical group and by the veterinary and dental command and control detachments. Specific units were designated to react within a short time frame to orders of the brigade headquarters. The result of this planning action was the establishment of a cross section of medical units capable of deploying within a minimum time.[13]

S-3 area medical surveys

In October 1968, Headquarters, United States Army, Vietnam (USARV) directed the brigade to conduct a survey of medical resources on all major bases and tactical operating bases. Headquarters, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) authorized the brigade to survey U.S. Army medical facilities throughout Vietnam and those U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy medical facilities located on installations designated to be surveyed. The main purpose of the survey was to ensure that each geographic area in which USARV troops were stationed was provided adequate medical coverage without an overlap or duplication of medical resources. An additional objective was to obtain a clearer visualization of the manner in which the medical service functioned at each of the major logistical bases.[13]

The following 19 bases were selected by the brigade headquarters to be surveyed by medical groups responsible for medical care in their areas:[13]

68th Medical Group

Vung Tau

Saigon/Cholon/Tan Son Nhut

The groups were not allowed to delegate responsibility for the conduct of the surveys to subordinate units. A detailed format was developed for the groups to utilize in documenting the results of each survey. This format, along with the requirement that the group headquarters conduct the surveys insured both comprehensiveness and standardization. Every aspect of medical support at a given base was required to be surveyed, to include preventive medicine, evacuation, hospitalization, laboratory service, dental service, veterinary service and dispensary service. At the end of 1968, the first two surveys had been completed and forwarded to Headquarters, USARV.[13]

Medical regulating

During 1968, the mission of the Medical Regulating Office continued to be the control of patient evacuation within and out of the Republic of Vietnam. Accumulation of daily medical statistics for medical regulating purposes remained a function of the office. The Medical Record Statistics Division, USARV Surgeon's Office continued to function as the primary agency for medical records and reports.[13]

The importance of having a responsive medical regulating system was dramatically demonstrated during both the Tet Offensive and the May Offensive.[13]

During February and May, close coordination with the U.S. Air Force aeromedical evacuation team was necessary to preclude overloads at the casualty staging flights and to arrange additional special flights, which in some cases originated at alternate air fields not normally used for out-of-country evacuations. The support and cooperation of the U.S. Air Force played an extremely important role in the successful operation of the 44th Medical Brigade's medical regulating system.[13]

In early 1968, there were few scheduled in-country and out-of-country flights available which limited evacuation and created the need for nonscheduled special flights. Shortly after the Tet Offensive, the number of scheduled in-country flights by the 903d Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron was increased to seven. These flights included stops at every major airfield in Vietnam and thereby provided fixed-wing evacuation capability to every major brigade hospital. Out-of-country evacuation flights operated by the Military Airlift Command originated from casualty staging facilities located at Da Nang, Cam Ranh Bay and Tan Son Nhut and provided evacuation to Japan, Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, Guam, Okinawa and Hawaii. With the increase in scheduled flights adequate coverage became available throughout Vietnam and allowed almost continuous medical evacuation.[13]

During the May Offensive, a total of 3,948 patients, 3,789 of which were U.S. Army personnel, were medically evacuated out-of-country to PACOM hospitals. These figures were the highest in the brigade's history.[13]

The brigade staff found it interesting to note the difference in the Tet and the May Offensives. During Tet, the enemy penetrated many cities and towns throughout South Vietnam. This action resulted in heavy civilian war casualties in addition to military casualties. Throughout the May Offensive, however, the enemy was unable to penetrate the cities to any great extent. As a result, the ratio of military casualties to civilian casualties was higher and resulted in a greater number of out-of-country evacuations.[13]

At the request of the brigade headquarters, the 7th Air Force Surgeon's Office inactivated the 25th Casualty Staging Flight (CSF) at Qui Nhon on 11 July 1968. This CSF had been utilized as a staging area for out-of-country evacuation of patients from the 67th Evacuation Hospital. Evacuation out-of-country from Qui Nhon was disadvantageous because all flights terminated at Clark Air Force Base. where it was necessary for patients regulated to Japan to remain overnight. As a result, patients lost at least one additional day prior to being further evacuated. After the 25th CSF was inactivated, all US military patients from the Qui Nhon area were evacuated to the 26th CSF at Cam Ranh Bay for further evacuation directly to Japan utilizing regularly scheduled Military Airlift Command flights. Korean patients were also evacuated to the 26th CSF for movement to Clark Air Force Base, and further evacuation to Korea. The primary advantages were the elimination of delays en route to destination hospitals and consolidation of out-of-country evacuations at casualty staging facilities serviced on a regular basis by Military Airlift Command flights.[13]

During 1968, the average daily beds occupied by MEDCAP patients throughout the brigade's medical treatment facilities rose from 61 per day in January to 285 per day in December. The brigade observed that as military activities decreased, the number of MEDCAP admissions increased. Civilian War Casualties accounted for approximately 27% of the total patients in brigade facilities. This figure remained fairly stable since April 1968. Following the May Offensive, the number of POWs hospitalized throughout the brigade remained constant at about 400 beds per day.[13]

Aeromedical evacuation

Aviation activities at the beginning of 1968 were similar to those of 1967. Workload continued to increase slightly with a new high of 12,520 evacuated in January. The Tet Offensive in February substantially increased the workload to 16,885 and the all-time high of 21,915 patients were evacuated by brigade aircraft during the month of May. Workload throughout the remainder of the year was fairly level in the range of 14,000 to 15,000 patients evacuated monthly with the exception of August and September when evacuation rose to nearly 17,000 in each month.[13]

Air ambulance resources available to support the increased workload were two medical companies (air ambulance) located at Long Binh and Qui Nhon, and 8 medical detachments (RA) located at Gia Le, Phu Bi and Chu Lai in the I CTZ, Pleiku and Nha Trang in the II CTZ, Long Binh and Cu Chi in the III CTZ, and Soc Trang in the IV CTZ. With these units, the 44th Medical Brigade was authorized 98 aircraft which provided minimally adequate evacuation support to the theater. On numerous occasions this capability was severely strained and frequently on short notice aircraft and crews were moved from one tactical zone to another to support areas of increased activities. This was especially true in the I CTZ where, because of limited air ambulance coverage, the assets of II CTZ North were repeatedly called upon to provide additional aircraft and crews.[13]

Aircraft maintenance throughout 1968 was generally satisfactory. Minimum acceptable availability was established at 70% and this availability rate was maintained with several exceptions. During February when the number of aircraft damaged by hostile fire doubled, availability rates dropped to 63%, and at times to below 50%. Although the same number of aircraft were damaged by hostile fire during the May Offensive, aircraft availability was maintained at 74%. This high availability was attributed to increased field maintenance responsiveness and the use of float aircraft issued to the air ambulance units by the supporting maintenance activities. The problem of limited resources and large geographic areas to support required field siting of aircraft to support a conflict characterized by small unit engagements at scattered locations. Often as many as 26 aircraft were field sited at 20 locations. Although the field siting of aircraft at sites remote from maintenance facilities created problems, it provided a responsiveness to tactical units that could not be assured by conventional area support.[13]

On 1 July 1968, the 101st Airborne Division was redesignated as an airmobile division. The 50th Medical Detachment (RA), located at Gia Le was assigned to the division and became the nucleus of the air ambulance platoon of the 326th Medical Battalion. The loss of the 50th Medical Detachment (RA) had no adverse effects on the brigade aeromedical evacuation capability because the unit had previously directed the bulk of its resources in support of the 101st Airborne Division.[13]

The arrival in-country of four additional medical detachments (RA) in November and December significantly increased the brigade capability. The addition of these units resulted in the following benefits:[13]

Permitted a reduction in field site requirements

Reduced individual aviator flying time

Increased aircraft availability and

Obviated the need to shift resources between groups

The new units were distributed as follows:[13]

The 68th Medical Detachment (RA) to Tuy Hoa

The 236th Medical Detachment (RA) to Da Nang

The 237th Medical Detachment (RA)to Camp Evans (Northwest of Hue)

The 247th Medical Detachment (RA) to Dong Tam

The requirement for a full-time aviation staff officer had long been recognized and the position was requested in an MTOE change submitted in February 1968. Approval was granted by USARPAC General Order Number 812, dated 9 December 1968. In addition to the aviation staff officer, a program was instituted to select and assign a company grade aviator to the brigade as the assistant aviation staff officer for a period of 90 days. The program ensured coverage in the aviation section during the absence of the aviation staff officer and allowed company grade officers an opportunity to gain valuable staff experience. Selection of officers alternated between the various air ambulance units in the brigade.[13]

In May 1968 the brigade was assigned a U-1A Otter fixed wing aircraft. After pilots were trained in May, the Otter became operational in June and proved to be a valuable addition to the brigade's aviation capability. It was used generally for the long-range transportation of medical personnel and critical supplies and equipment. Availability was excellent and utilization high. The Otter averaged 65 hours a month, with its high month being June when 96 hours were logged. At the end of 1968, the brigade was giving serious consideration to including a requirement for a fixed wing aircraft in the next brigade MTOE change submission.[13]

Communications

The success of the 44th Medical Brigade's mission accomplishment during 1968 was directly related to its communications facilities.[13]

The two primary nets within the brigade were the single side band (SSB) and the Dustoff (medical evacuation) radio nets. A discussion of the systems follows:[13]

1. During 1968 the Department of the Army approved a brigade request for thirty-eight AN/FRC-93 Collins SSB radios. Thirty of these radios were received and utilized in a brigade net and four internal medical group nets. The SSB nets were used primarily in the regulating of patients within the brigade and the exchange of command message traffic. The SSB brigade net allowed the brigade commander to communicate readily with even his most distant units.[13]

2. Dustoff radio nets utilized both FM and UHF radios. The primary FM net was composed of VRC-46s at the local Dustoff control stations and ARC-54s in the aircraft. The primary FM net was used to receive and relay Dustoff missions and for command and control of the aircraft. The UHF net was composed of VRC-24s at the local Dustoff control station and VRC 15s in the aircraft. The UHF net served as the back-up system for the primary FM net. The alternate FM net was utilized to relay information on the type of casualties aboard to the medical groups which in turn directed the aircraft to the appropriate destination hospital.[13]

S-2/historian

Throughout 1968, the S-2 officer supervised the 44th Medical Brigade personnel security and intelligence program, directed the brigade historical program and was responsible for the preparation of activities and operations reports.[13]

In mid-1968, efforts were undertaken to establish a working relationship between the 521st Medical Detachment (QA), a medical intelligence unit under the Combined Materiel Exploitation Center at MACV and the 44th Medical Brigade. In late December, brigade headquarters hosted a conference which brought
