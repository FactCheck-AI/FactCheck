Hackesche Höfe (The Hacke Courtyards, 1907)

Outside the Spandauer Tor (the Spandau Gate), until about 1730, the Spandauer Vorstadt (the Spandau suburb) was located; when the Prussian king ordered to build a new and larger wall around Berlin, this suburb was suddenly located inside these walls, so the old fortifications were destroyed and the town commander, Count of Hacke, built a new market instead.

By the end of the XIXth century, due to a favourable economic development, the quarter became a good address. Consequently, the old buildings were destroyed and instead, a big complex of eight courtyards was built, the biggest of this kind in Europe. Then and now, in this complex can be found a mixture of apartments, restaurants, shops and workshops.
