Flex-fit Mechanical Pencil  0.7 mm Lead Diameter  Blue Barrel  1 Each

Description

Pentel PW27C

Pencils feature Pentel's exclusive, revolutionary Lead Maximizer system, which automatically feeds lead into the sleeve for continuous writing & greater lead usage. Maximizer technology means fewer jams & less lead breakage. The dual-action retractable mechanism protects the pencil tip. Grid-like pattern on the rubber grip creates a comfortable no-slip surface, yet it yields to fingertips for writing comfort. Refillable. Uses Pentel's Super Hi-Polymer lead & Z2-1 refill eraser.
