Notes for C

ARDINAL PEDRO GONZALEZ-DE-MENDOZA:

"El Gran Cardenal". In 1454, he was the Bishop of Calahorra. In 1467, Bishop of Siquenza. In 1474. Archbishop of Seville.1482, Toledo. Cardinal 1473. Primate of Spain in 1482. He would also rule Spain.

The Cardinal and statesman, was the fourth son of Inigo Lopez de Mendoza, Marques of Santillana, and Duke of Infantado.

He was born on May 3, 1428, at Guadalajara, Spain in New Castile, the chief lordship of his family. The house of Mendoza claimed to descend from the lords of Llodio in Alava, and to have been settled in Old Castile, in the 11th century. One chief of the house had been greatly distinguished at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212. Another had been Admiral of Castile in the reign of Alfonso X of Castile. Alphonso the Wise. Peter I of Castile, Peter the Cruel, had endowed them with the lordships of Hita and Buitrago. The greatness of the Mendozas was completed by Pedro Gonzalez, who sacrificed his life to save John I of Castile. King John I at the battle of Aljubarrota in 1385. The cardinal's father, the Marquis of Santillana, received on August 8, 1445, a title he bore for the greater part of his life, was a poet, and was conspicuous during the troubled reign of John II of Castile.

Loyalty to the Crown was the traditional and prevailing policy of the family. Pedro Gonzalez, the future cardinal, was sent into the Church mainly because he was a younger son and that he might be handsomely provided for. He had no vocation, and was an example of the worldly, political and martial prelates of the 15th century. In 1452 at the age of twenty-four, he was chosen by the king John II to be bishop of Calahorra, but did not receive the pope's bull till 1454. As bishop of Calahorra he was also señor (Lord), or civil and military ruler, of the town and its dependent district. In his secular capacity he led the levies of Calahorra in the civil wars of the reign of Henry IV of Castile. He fought for the king at the second battle of Olmedo on August 20, 1467, and was wounded in the arm.

During these years he became attached to Dona Mencia de Lemus, a Portuguese lady-in-waiting of the queen. She bore him two sons, Rodrigo, who was once selected to be the husband of Lucrezia Borgia, and Diego, who was the grandfather of the princess of Eboli of the reign of Philip II of Spain. By another lady of a Valladolid family he had a third son who afterwards emigrated to France. In 1468, he became bishop of Siguenza. In 1473 he was created cardinal, was promoted to the archbishopric of Seville and named chancellor of Castile. During the last years of the reign of King Henry IV. he was the partisan of the Princess Isabella of Castile,afterwards queen. He fought for her at the battle of Toro on March 1, 1476; had a prominent part in placing her on the throne; and served her indefatigably in her efforts to suppress the disorderly nobles of Castile. In 1482 he became archbishop of Toledo.

During the conquest of Granada he contributed largely to the maintenance of the army. On January 2, 1492, he occupied the town in the name of the Catholic sovereigns. Though his life was worldly, and though he was more soldier and statesman than priest, the "Great Cardinal," as he was commonly called, did not neglect his duty as a bishop. He used his influence with the queen and also at Rome to arrange a settlement of the disputes between the Spanish sovereigns and the papacy. Though he maintained a splendid household as archbishop of Toledo, and, provided handsomely for his children, he devoted part of his revenue to charity, and with part he endowed the college of Santa Cruz at Valladolid. His health broke down at the close of 1493. Queen Isabella visited and nursed him on his deathbed in Guadalajara. It is said that he recommended her to choose as his successor the Franciscan, Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros, a man who had no likeness to himself save in political faculty and devotion to the authority of the Crown.

VICEROY ANTONIO6DE MENDOZA-Y-PACHECO (PEDRO5 LOPEZ-DE-MENDOZA, INIGO4, INIGO3, DIEGO2 HURTADO-DE-MENDOZA, PEDRO1 GONZALEZ-DE-MENDOZA) was born Abt. 1490 in Granada, Spain, and died 21 Jul 1552 in Lima, Peru. He married (1) BEATRIZDE ESTRADA. He married (2) CATALINA CARVAJAL-DE-VARGOS Abt. 1517. She died Bef. 1534 in Spain.

Don Antonio de Mendoza was influential in his roll as the first viceroy of New Spain. Some consider him to have been one of it's greatest leaders. He led from 1535-1549. In order to fully understand and appreciate what was accomplished under Mendoza one must have some knowledge of the viceroy system and the establishment of the system.

The viceroy system was first used under Columbus. The Viceroyalty proved to be the most important administrative unit in the Indies. (Bethell, p. 293) The system was revived when Don Antonio de Mendoza was appointed as the first viceroy in 1535. The viceroy was defined as the king's alter ego. He held court in his vice regal palace and even carried with him some of the ceremonial aura of kingship. "He combined in his person the attributes of governor and captain-general, and he was also, in his role as president of the audience, regarded as the principal judicial representative of the crown." (Bethell, p.294) Many consider Mendoza to be responsible for the beginning of the viceroys and the colonial courts. "He was a man of integrity, well fitted to initiate the vice regal regime in the New World." (Crow, p. 169) Mendoza's reputation preceded him. At this point he had already received honors as a soldier and diplomat. Mendoza served first in Mexico and later in Peru.

The viceroys served the King yet they were allowed some freedom and discernment as they ruled. For example, there were many times that statues would come down from the King that the viceroy felt was unnecessary or unbeneficial for the colony. It became a common practice for the viceroy to hold the statue up and say, "Se acata, pero no se cumple". Simply stated, "It shall be respected, but not enforced." This satisfied the King and the colony.(Crow, p.175)

The viceroys were always greeted with great dignity and splendor. The cities would decorate the streets and prepare for his coming. Many times the people dressed in their ceremonial regalia. Due to the great expense of these ceremonies, the King later limited the amount that could be used on these such events to eight thousand dollars.

When Mendoza arrived in Mexico, the country was in turmoil. There was already a definite problem brewing between the Indians and the encomenderos. They were on the verge of revolt. Mendoza came in and worked quickly and swiftly. He was able to defeat the Indians and later when the opportunity presented itself, Alvarado was slain. Mendoza soon appointed his men and established his position. Mendoza was wise and made excellent decisions throughout his time in Mexico. Mexico benefited in several ways from his presence and position.

He was able to spare Mexico from a civil war and able to gain the respect of many of the encomenderos. He is said to have shown great generosity and hospitality to the encomenderos thus winning many of them to his side. He was also successful with the Indians. He established one day a week as an opportunity for the Indians to come and express their grievances. Hundreds of Indians took advantage of this opportunity. Mendoza was quoted as saying, "I made a habit always to hear the Indians; and although they very often lie to me, I do not show them any displeasure for it, for I do not believe them and I do not decide anything until I have found out the truth. There are some [Spaniards] who think that I make them [the Indians] more addicted to lying because I do not punish them; but I believe that it would be more harmful to make them afraid of coming to me with their troubles than for me to bear the trouble which their childish affairs causes me. I recommend you to hear them also."(Madariaga, p. 48) Actually after Mendoza's retirement the custom continued and a General Indian Court was established. (Crow, p. 170)

Mendoza was also known for his interest in education. He supported the education of the Indians and the development of schools. Many schools were established for young Indian boys and girls. The purpose of the schools for the boys was to teach them Spanish and manual arts. The girls would be trained for motherhood. Mendoza eventually started a school for the unclaimed mesitzos. The mestizos were a group of children from mixed marriages. His school was called the San Juan de Letran and survived for more than three hundred years. (Herring, p. 209)

Another attribute of Mendoza was his desire to maintain the system of free elections. He studied and examined the new system but eventually decided to abolish the habit of appointing friars and settlers. He chose to maintain free elections and was quite out spoken on the issue. "He was particular about the freedom to be left to the electorate: Y que esta eleccion se la dejen hacer libremente." (Madariaga, p. 47)

Mendoza was successful in industry and agriculture. He is responsible for developing silk, olive trees, wheat, cattle breeding, and many other industrial activities. The Crown for his ingenuity and hard work rewarded him. The prize consisted of two bars of silver of three hundred ducats apiece.

Mendoza's length of service was exceptional and after the system was established a viceroy could expect to serve a six-year term of office. Mendoza died shortly after taking office in Peru and would never have a direct hand in the future of Peru, but what he had accomplished in Mexico was nothing short of outstanding. Mexico had been changed for the better due to the hard work of Mendoza. Mexico went from a struggling and disorganized colony to a well-organized colony. Indian resistance was ended and the power of the conquistadors was broken. The territory had been carefully explored with the adding of the Philippine Islands. Silver had been discovered and they were already enjoying the benefits.

Much of the success of the viceroy system can be credited to Mendoza. He was truly a successful viceroy. He was the first but he also was one of the greatest.

MARIA7DE IRCIO-Y-MENDOZA (LEONOR6 BELTRAN, PEDRO5 LOPEZ-DE-MENDOZA, INIGO4, INIGO3, DIEGO2 HURTADO-DE-MENDOZA, PEDRO1 GONZALEZ-DE-MENDOZA) was born in New Spain (Mexico). She married VICEROY LUIS FERNANDEZ-DE-VELASCO II in New Spain (Mexico), son of LUIS FERNANDEZ-DE-VELASCO and ANADE CASTILLA. He was born in Carrion de los Condes, Castile, Spain.

Spanish administrator, Luis Fernandez de Velasco, served as the second viceroy (1550-1564) of New Spain (Mexico), successor to Antonio de Mendoza. His rule was remarkably energetic, humanitarian, and free of corruption. He did much to improve the condition of the natives and thus aroused the opposition of many of the powerful Spaniards in Mexico. In 1553 the Univ. of Mexico was founded. Exploring expeditions were sent outFrancisco de Ibarra conquered Nueva Vizcaya and Miguel López de Legaspi conquered the Philippines. Velasco was beloved by the people of Mexico, especially the indigenous peoples. His son, Luis de Velasco, 1534-1617, was viceroy of New Spain (1590-95, 1607-11) and of Peru (1595-1604). In Mexico he helped to quell the rather obscure conspiracy in which Martín Cortés, the son of the conqueror, was involved. Appointed viceroy after distinguished service in Spain, Velasco continued the work of his father in aiding the indigenous peoples, encouraged weaving and other native industries, beautified Mexico City, strengthened fortifications at Veracruz, and extended the conquest to the north, pacifying the natives. As viceroy of Peru he again worked to improve native conditions, particularly in the mines; he also tried to ward off buccaneer attacks, encouraged education, and reformed postal service. Velasco returned to Mexico but was not allowed to continue long in private life. Viceroy of Mexico a second time, he began the drainage of lakes about Mexico City, put down a black revolt near Orizaba, and sent out Sebastián Vizcaíno on explorations (1611). One of the finest Spanish colonial administrators, Velasco was later president of the Council of the Indies. He was rewarded with the title of Marqués de Salinas.
