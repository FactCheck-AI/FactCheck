Footage of an unreleased sequel to 2006's Scarface: The World Is Yours has now surfaced online, giving fans a closer look at what could've been a video game franchise based on the classic film. Originally in development as a follow-up to the 16-year-old title that picked up after the events of the film itself, the game was long rumored to be in production, with Radical Entertainment building a working pre-alpha version, although this is the first time gameplay footage has actually been released.

According to YouTube channel Mafia Game Videos, the game would've been called Scarface Empire and was set in Las Vegas, boasting upgraded graphics as well as new gameplay mechanics. It added over on Twitter that the sequel was built on a modified engine that was first used by the open-world Hulk games that the studio developed, and it was then used to create the open-world Prototype game as well

Unfortunately, the sequel was never actually released, but you can catch a glimpse of it in the video above.
