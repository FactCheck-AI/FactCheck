Biography: Louis Renault founded the Renault company in 1899 with his brothers Marcel and Fernand. He played a key role in developing and popularizing the automobile in France.

Under Renault's leadership, the company grew to become one of the largest automobile manufacturers in France and Europe. During World War I, Renault's factories produced military vehicles and equipment for the Allied forces. They also built the Renault FT tank, which set the standard for modern tanks since.

In the years between the two world wars, Renault continued to innovate and expand his business. He introduced new models and production techniques. During World War II, however, Renault's factories were taken over by the German occupation forces, and he was accused of collaborating with the enemy.

After the war, Renault was arrested and died in custody before he could face trial. Following his death, the Renault company was nationalized by the French government and it remains a major player in the global automobile industry to this day.
