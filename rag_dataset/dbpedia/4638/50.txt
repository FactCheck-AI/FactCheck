Biography

Clark is a British electronic musician, composer, and performer who has been working in music for over 20 years.

Signed at an early age to the British indie label Warp, he has since released nine studio albums on Warp Records. The release of his 2014 album, the eponymously titled Clark, was followed by an extensive 70-date worldwide tour which took him to festivals including Pitchfork (Chicago), Field Day (London), Taico (Japan) and MoMA (New York) amongst many others. His 2017 album, ‘Death Peak’, was extensively toured with a fully choreographed show by acclaimed choreographer Melanie Lane. Clark’s most recent album, ‘Playground In A Lake’, tackles the reality of climate change through mythological terms and musical experimentation, producing a powerfully provocative and atmospheric album.

In addition to releasing new albums and EPs, Clark continues to evolve his sound through innovative, original scores for film and television. He scored the music to TV series, Kiri – a gripping four-part drama from BAFTA-winning writer Jack Thorne (This Is England, Skins, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child), and starring BAFTA-winning Sarah Lancashire (Happy Valley, Last Tango in Halifax). The first episode averaged 3.2 million viewers – Channel 4’s biggest drama launch in over two years. Most recently, he composed the score for Apple Tv+’s American horror drama miniseries Lisey’s Story starring Julianne Moore, based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Stephen King. His additional compositional contributions include TV (HBO, Sky and AMC, and The Last Panthers for Sky Atlantic) and Video Games (Sleeping Dogs).
