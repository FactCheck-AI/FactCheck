UW-Stevens Point Captures Men’s Ice Hockey National Championship

STEVENS POINT, Wis.--University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point captured the NCAA Division III Men’s Ice Hockey Championship with a 3-2 overtime victory over Norwich University (Vt.) at K.B. Willett Arena on March 23.

The national championship is the sixth in program history (1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 2016) and 10th captured by a Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) program. NCAA Division III titles have been won previously by UW-Eau Claire (2013), UW-River Falls (1988, 1994) and UW-Superior (2002). National Association of Intercollegiate Athletic championships were won by UW-Superior in 1976, UW-River Falls in 1983 and UW-Eau Claire in 1984. Since the 1982-83 academic year, WIAC schools have combined to secure 117 NCAA Division III team championships.

Steven Quagliata recorded the game-winning goal at 15:13 of the overtime period. UW-Stevens Point finished the 2018-19 campaign with a 29-0-2 record, the first unbeaten national champion in NCAA Division III history.

Sophomore Steven Quagliata scored 15:13 into overtime as UW-Stevens Point extended its program record unbeaten streak to 31 games (29-0-2) and become the first-ever unbeaten national champion in NCAA Division III history.

Sophomore goaltender Connor Ryckman picked up his 26th win of the year, also a program record for single-season victories by a goaltender. He made 26 saves, including four in overtime.

After a pair of scoreless periods, the Pointers broke the ice early in the third. Just 3:31 into the period, Danny Kiraly fired a shot from the boards that freshman Jordan Fader tipped in for a 1-0 lead. Ryan MacKellar also had an assist on the goal.

Just over a minute later, Colin Raver made it 2-0 in favor of the Pointers. Tanner Karty and Zach Zech picked up assists on the goal.

At 7:01 of the third, Norwich (23-5-3) got on the board. Coby Downs slipped one past Ryckman to cut UW-Stevens Point’s lead to 2-1.

Downs scored again at the 12:15 mark to tie the game at 2-2. Both teams had chances late in regulation and through the first part of overtime.

At 15:13 of overtime, Quagliata skated down the near boards and flipped a wrister top-shelf for the game winner. Stephan Beauvais and Raver were credited with assists on the game-winner.

Norwich goaltender Tom Aubrun stopped 42 shots.

The Pointers racked up a number of honors after the championship. Senior Tanner Karty was named Most Outstanding Player of the Championship. Ryckman and Raver also earned all-tournament team honors.
