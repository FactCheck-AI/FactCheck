The Peekamoose Blue Hole is located in Sundown Wild Forest, set within the Catskill Forest Preserve. The Blue Hole is a depression in the streambed rock of the Rondout Creek, a unique natural feature formed by sand and swirling gravel in an ancient whirlpool. The creek is part of the New York City drinking water watershed. Over the last few years, the visitor experience has been affected by the presence of large crowds on summer weekends.
