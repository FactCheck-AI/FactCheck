Art historian Dr Nichole Fazio celebrates the work of pioneering Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron who captured images of eminent people of her day, including John Herschel, Alfred Tennyson, Henry Taylor, George Frederic Watts, Ellen Terry and Julia Stephen.

Fazio draws on photographic collections at the Bodleian Library and Ashmolean Museum to explain how Cameron was convinced of the poetic possibilities of the new medium and particularly its capacity for suggestive rather than literal meaning. She also discusses Cameron’s own poetry and key images she created as illustrations for Tennyson’s Idylls of the King and Other Poems.

Fazio received her doctorate in history of art from the University of Oxford where she specialised in 19th-century British photography. She is associate dean of undergraduate research and scholars programs at the University of Chicago.

Presented by Bodleian Libraries.
