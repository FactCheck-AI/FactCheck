Signs of Life is a rare group of artists that formed a bond early in their music careers. Every year this band gets together, joined by some characters they've picked up along the way, to drop their collective experiences into a musical evening. When they take all those early years of bonding musically and then sprinkle in three decades of experiences, you get one heck of a live show! The all-star cast includes Barbara Kessler, Tim Day, Mario Perrett, Mark (Shecky) Yurkovic, Chris Leadbetter, Jeff St. Pierre and Phil Antoniades. Signs of Life cover a huge swath of your favorite music from Sly And The Family Stone to U2, Led Zeppelin to Bonnie Raitt, STP to Fleedwood Mac, Steely Dan to The Pretenders as well as a selection of original songs from various projects within the band! These guys have worked with or shared the stage with so many amazing artists including: Van Halen, The Spin Doctors, The Dave Mathews Band, Violent Femmes, Hootie & The Blowfish, The Indigo Girls, Jimmy Buffett, BB King, Buddy Guy, Rusted Root, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Monkees, oh yeah there's more... Blood Sweat & Tears, Livingston Taylor, Luther Guitar Johnson, Blues Traveler, Shawn Colvin, NRBQ, Tom Petty, Dr. John, Rick Danko, Mighty Sam McLean, Quiet Riot, Eddie Money, John Anderson, The Guess Who, Rustic Overtones (and thatâ€™s only who we could remember...!) The result is a little bit of hard-to-define magic when we play together. We would love the opportunity to work with you to make your event unique by customizing a musical experience that will delight you and your guests.
