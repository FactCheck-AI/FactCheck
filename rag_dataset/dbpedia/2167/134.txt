Denver

Signs and Signals is a unique and catchy alternative rock band originally formed in Denver, Colorado in May of 2014. The band is on a collective mission to express the depths of being human; they are not afraid to face any amount of darkness or light in order to understand the infinite through their art. Their sound ropes you in with its strong melodies, layering of the guitar and keys, and an intricate rhythm section that makes you want to move. All this leads to an exciting and original brand of music unlike anything previously heard.
