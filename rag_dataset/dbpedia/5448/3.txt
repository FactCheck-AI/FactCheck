For movie buffs, Zasu Pitts inhabits one of two galaxies. She was an object of silent tragedies, most memorably enshrined in Erich von Stroheim’s Greed. For those of us more attuned to the talkies, Pitts is more readily remembered for her dozens (upon dozens) of supporting and leading roles as a wispy, fragile woman, who is almost always overwhelmed by the world– or a stiff breeze. The pre-Code era were a particularly fruitful time for Pitts, who also starred in a series of short comedies for Hal Roach with Thelma Todd while working all across town to add a few laughs to pictures as needed.

And, of course, for reference:
