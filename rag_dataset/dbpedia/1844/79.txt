Magadan-13 Airport (Russian: Аэропорт Магадан-13) (ICAO: UHMT) is a small airport in Russia located 10 km northeast of Magadan. It handles most propeller-driven transports. Regular passenger Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft were flying here in the 1950s and early 1960s. In the 1970s and 1980s it was a busy airport for charter operations (Antonov An-2, Mi-4, Mi-8, etc.) which served geological expeditions, firefighters, and local transport routes.
