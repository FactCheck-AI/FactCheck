Originating from African American communities in the Deep South, the blues has left an indelible mark on the world of music. From the Mississippi Delta to Chicago’s bustling streets, it has woven its way into the hearts of countless listeners. At the centre of this rich heritage stand three towering figures known as the Kings of the Blues – Albert, B.B., and Freddie King – who, despite the similarities in names, weren’t related to each other at all!

Albert King

Born in 1923 in Indianola, Mississippi, Albert King was known for his deep, rumbling voice and his masterful guitar playing. Despite early hardships, he rose to prominence with hits like “Born Under a Bad Sign” and “Crosscut Saw”. His innovative string-bending technique and unique style left a lasting impact on the blues scene.

His guitar playing was nothing short of revolutionary. He played left-handed on a right-handed guitar, which contributed to his distinctive sound. His use of minor pentatonic scales and string bends created a haunting, expressive tone. Albert’s contributions to the blues include his innovative techniques and the emotional depth of his music.

B.B. King

Riley B. King, better known as B.B. King, was born in 1925 in Berclair, Mississippi. He earned the title of “King of the Blues” through his emotive singing and complex guitar solos. B.B.’s career spanned over six decades, and his hits like “The Thrill Is Gone” and “Lucille” have become blues anthems. His influence extends beyond blues, touching genres like rock and jazz.
