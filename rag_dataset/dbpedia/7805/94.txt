From his personal experience and prayer, he articulated a guide for finding God and self called the Spiritual Exercises that for centuries has enabled individuals to grow in faith and willingness to work for the greater glory of God, the motto of the Society of Jesus.

Under his direction, the Society of Jesus established schools throughout the continent beginning in Messina, Sicily, in 1548. The Jesuits became known as the schoolmasters of Europe, and over time emerged as the largest religious order in the Catholic Church and one of the greatest influences in Western civilization.

Today, the Society of Jesus totals 17,000 members who minister in 112 countries through education, advocacy for the poor, and missionary work. In the US alone, the Jesuits sponsor 28 colleges and universities and 47 high schools, while worldwide they educate approximately 1 million students in 2,300 schools.

True to their heritage, Jesuits remain contemplatives in action who, like their founder, engage critical challenges of the world. Their students and alumni are encouraged to develop their God-given talents and use them in the service of others to help make the world a more just and humane place.

Why a Jesuit Education?

Boston College seeks to provide an education that will promote integration of the intellectual, social, religious, and affective dimensions. It urges students to reflect deeply on who they are and how they want to live their lives.

Drawing on the heritage of St. Ignatius Loyola, Boston College invites students into a conversation that asks enduring questions and promotes engagement with the complex problems in today’s world.

In addition, Boston College encourages members of its community to be attentive to their own experiences, to reflect on them, and to use their talents to respond to the world’s needs, based on the conviction that God can be found in all human activity, especially in the search for truth and meaning.
