Be careful on the roads â€” a winter weather advisory is in effect for parts of the Southern Tier until 6 p.m. Wednesday.

According to the National Weather Service, slippery road conditions are expected as on-and-off lake effect snow showers move through the area. Up to 3 inches of snow are expected.

Counties affected include Broome, Tioga, Tompkins, Otsego and Delaware.

A winter weather advisory for snow means periods of snow will cause primarily travel difficulties.

Most of the anticipated snow will fall in the morning, the weather service said, but be prepared for rapidly fluctuating visibility. Winds will gust as high as 35 miles per hour, causing blowing and drifting of any snow that falls.

The wind chills will also be in the single digits below zero at times Wednesday morning.
