Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah announced that the eagerly anticipated inauguration of the extended Purple Line of Namma Metro in Bengaluru — from Challaghatta to Kadugodi (Whitefield) — will become operational in September 2023.

Addressing people on the occasion of the 77th Independence Day at Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw Parade Ground on August 15, Mr Siddaramaiah, said, “At present, the total stretch of metro train network in Bengaluru is 69.66 km. About 6.1 lakh passengers are using the metro train facilities daily. By September 2023, the Baiyappanahalli-Krishnarajapura line and Kengeri-Challaghatta line expansion will be ready.”

The Nagasandra-Madavara extension on the Green Line and the new line between R.V. Road and Bommanahalli are expected to be operational by December 2023. By 2026, Namma Metro will have a 175.55-km network in Bengaluru. Today, the metro network in Bengaluru stands second in India, Mr Siddaramaiah informed.

The BMRCL is conducting load test of the Open Web Girder (OWG) on the Baiyappanahalli-Krishnarajapura line. Previously, the BMRCL had set August as the deadline to complete the work on the missing 2-km segment.

Due to the missing link, metro passengers have been forced to use a feeder service for a distance of 5 km to reach K.R. Puram after getting down at Baiyappanahalli. Feeder services run by the Bengaluru Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) are being utilised by up to 8,000 passengers every day.

Close to 27,000 passengers are using the new K.R. Pura to Whitefield metro line. A major jump in patronage is expected after the BMRCL opens the entire 15.5-km metro line.
