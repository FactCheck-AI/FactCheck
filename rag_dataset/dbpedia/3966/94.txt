Three large arched openings on the front fa√ßade of Our Lady of Loreto represent the Holy Trinity and dramatic interior structural columns echo the symbolism of the trees in the forest found in the First Book of Chronicles. Accommodating 1,200 worshipers in intimate surroundings, the sanctuary provides direct views for all. A courtyard serves as an outdoor sanctuary for special Masses and gatherings. The second floor houses administrative offices and flexible open space.

Windows capture the commanding mountain views and the extraordinary high altitude light, reflecting the timelessness of the church while offering an intimate Mass experience for each churchgoer. The octagonal shape intentionally avoids the usual square, rectangular or oval configurations of most modern-day churches.

In collaboration with the founding pastor, Tryba Architects designed every furnishing down to the last detail, including the ambry glass vessels containing the sacred oils.
