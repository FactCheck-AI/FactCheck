Decoration Of The Western Chalukyas Influenced The Hoysala Decoration. The Pillar Image Called “Sthambha Buttalikas” Seen In Hoysala Art Bears Evidence Of Chola And Chalukya Art.

The Hoysala Artists Ornamented Both The Top And Surface Of The Pillars While Chalukya Artists Left The Top Plain And Decorated Only The Surface.
