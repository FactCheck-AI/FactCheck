BERLIN // Bayern Munich began their defence of the German Cup with a comfortable 4-1 first-round win away to third-tier side Preussen Munster on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up was deprived of the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger and there was no Franck Ribery, but it did feature five members of the Germany side that won the World Cup five weeks ago.

The man who scored the winning goal against Argentina at the Maracana, Mario Goetze, opened the scoring for Bayern with a header from a Robert Lewandowski cross, before Thomas Mueller doubled their lead.

David Alaba and Claudio Pizarro added further efforts in the second half but Lewandowski, chasing his first goal for the club since his move from Borussia Dormtund, had a late penalty saved.

Four days after losing Spanish international Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in their German SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, Guardiola handed a start in defence to Holger Badstuber, who has been out injured for the last 20 months.

Meanwhile, Hoffenheim won 9-0 away to fifth-tier amateurs Paloma in Hamburg, with Sven Schipplock scoring five of the goals. However, Werder Bremen required extra time before winning 3-2 away to fifth-tier opposition in Illertissen.

Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also progressed this weekend, but top-flight sides Mainz and VfB Stuttgart fell by the wayside.
