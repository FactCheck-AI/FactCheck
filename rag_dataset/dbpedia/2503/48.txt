Nina Palomba, a.k.a. Nina’s World, is a muralist and illustrator known for her unique blend of street and pop art, lgbtq+ advocacy, and multicolored nostalgia. In addition to the creation of pretty impressive murals and paintings, her creativity can be found across TV, film and commercials.

She works as an art director and production designer for various global studios, consumer brands, and media companies. Palomba’s comic-influenced work stands out from the rest of the contemporary art scene. And not just due to her eye-catching color palette, but due to her reshaping familiar symbols to create a modernized dialogue.
