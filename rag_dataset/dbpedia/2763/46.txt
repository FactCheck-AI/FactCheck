The tug, SS Ymir was launched in 1899 at the Canadian Pacific Railway shipyard at Nelson on Lake Kootenay, British Columbia. The tug was the first built for CPR’s barge service on Kootenay Lake. It was designed to push or tow railroad car barges, some carrying as many as 15 loaded rail cars, between Nelson, Procter, and Kootenay Landing in southern British Columbia. CPR would eventually complete a rail line linking those points, but not before 1928. Ymir was a wooden-hulled, screw-driven tug of about 90 gross tons with the following dimensions:. 77.7 ft (23.7 m) long, 16.7 ft (5.1 m) beam, 6.5 ft (2m) hull depth, 27.3 hp steam engine. Ymir does not have a colorful history involving collisions, being frozen in ice, fires, or other mishaps. Instead, she is remembered as a steady, dependable vessel doing its part during the hectic Klondike gold rush days and the years following. She was retired in the late 1920’s after CPR completed rail service around Kootenay Lake.

The SS Ymir was built in 1898 in Nelson by J.M. Bulger for the CPR. It transported rail cars on the Nelson - Kootenay Landing barge run until 1909. After that, it was used as a relief vessel for newer more powerful tugboats. It burned in 1909 and was rebuilt and refitted in 1914 with more space for passengers. It relieved the Moyie on the Crawford Bay run from 1923 to 1929 when it was scuttled in front of the Nelson Shipyard. Today, the wreck is a popular dive site.

In the late 1800's the lake steamers accepted mail offered to them in much the same manner as those on the coast and with the exception of the S.S. Aberdeen, which was a recognized R.P.O., they rarely applied the ship's hand stamp to the letters or postcards. As the rail service provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway Lake and River Service and its subsidiaries expanded official Railway Post Offices were established and the transporting of mail by ship was transferred to land based R.P.O. routes. - this article was written by William Topping.

A 20 mile rail link eastward from Nelson to Procter, which was usually an ice free port on Kootenay Lake in winter, was completed in 1901. The missing rail link between Procter and Kootenay Landing was not completed until 1931. Prior to that time, freight, passengers and mail depended on bridging the gap by lake boat. The Medicine Hat & Nelson R.P.O. service began in 1901 and ended in 1957.
