St. Stanislaus School

Saint Stanislaus is a Catholic day and boarding school for young men in grades seven through twelve. Located just an hour’s drive from the cultural offerings of New Orleans along the picturesque Gulf of Mexico coastline, the school attracts students from across the United States and around the world. After suffering from hurricane damage in 2005, St. Stanislaus underwent extensive renovations to resume classroom and recreation functions affected by the storm.

Designed by Unabridged Architecture, the renovation utilized sustainable practices to develop a healthy academic environment for its junior high and high school students. AOS sourced furniture that would create welcoming entrances, productive administration offices and collaborative student activity areas. AOS was also involved in installing custom storage for the school’s state-of-the art marine biology lab. As a home away from home for its students, St. Stanislaus continues to support educational success, foster personal growth and increase student satisfaction on campus.
