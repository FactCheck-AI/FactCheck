Established in 1886, St James Baptist Church is a church of historical significance because it is the only remaining institution remaining from the town of Mitchelville, the freedmen’s village established by United States Army in 1862.

As the First Baptist Church relocated to another area some former members of that congregation, desirous of a place of worship in Mitchelville, organized St. James Baptist Church. St. James has been a continuous presence and a center of spiritual and civic involvement since 1886.

St. James has served as the caretaker of the Old Cherry Hill School located across the road from the sanctuary as well as being the caretaker of several native islander cemeteries.

It is unfortunate that the early church records were destroyed in 1968 when fire destroyed the house of the church officer where they were kept. What is known is that the first church building and its contents was destroyed by fire in 1945. It was replaced by another wooden structure that served the congregation until the present brick sanctuary was built in 1972.

Changes are again on the horizon for St. James because growth of the Hilton Head Island Airport is forcing the church to be relocated.

The Town of Hilton Head has agreed to purchase the property and build a new sanctuary for the congregation in an area close by but outside of the airport’s “object-free zone. In addition, the Old Cherry Hill School, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, will be relocated adjacent to the church.

Information for this report was gathered from several press clippings and a church history prepared for the church’s 125th anniversary on file at the Heritage Library.
