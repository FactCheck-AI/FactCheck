The St. James Episcopal Church was built in 1894 and is listed in the National Historic Register of Historic Places. It is built in the English Country subset of Gothic style architecture rendered in brick. In the 1940s, the parish hall and rectory were added, followed by a second vestry (a room for clergy and choir to dress in official robes prior to service). These three additions all appear in updated architectural plans from 1949, but records indicate the vestry may have been completed slightly after this date.

From the National Register description: St. James Episcopal Church is architecturally significant as one of the best brick examples of an English country church in the Gothic style in Idaho. Its attention to detail and concise visual statement makes it a local landmark. Triangular stained-glass windows break the interior’s open ceiling to create a mock clerestory which adds to the already handsome interior.
