Visit the site of George Washington's farewell to his officers in 1783, in Manhattan's oldest surviving structure. Fraunces Tavern is New York's only museum dedicated to American Revolutionary War history, and the place where much of it happened. After the war, it housed the fledgling nation's first departments of War, Treasury and Foreign Affairs. Opened as a museum by the Sons of the Revolution in the State of New York in 1907, today visitors can see period rooms, paintings, changing exhibits and events exploring Revolutionary America.
