There is something raw and disruptive about La Lupe and her modalities of performance, something that far exceeds tropes of so-called hysteria and all the gendered and racial scripts that come along with it. Uncontrolled expression opens up new routes; it presses against obligatory composure.

The boleros, boogaloos and salsas of Reina de la Canción Latina contain lessons about love, about a willingness to stay alive, about what it means to push against the confines. Reina de la Canción Latina asks us to listen to La Lupe outside of a binary mode — to look a little deeper, to find her personhood and to search for flashes of freedom wherever we can.
