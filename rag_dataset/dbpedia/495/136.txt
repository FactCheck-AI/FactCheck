The independent vinyl retail community in the United States has called for an end to the practice of direct-to-consumer pre-sell exclusivity windows.

A pre-sell exclusivity window is described as when an artist or label’s website “is the first and only destination upon album announcement” where fans can pre-order an upcoming new album on vinyl.

According to the retailers, the practice can decrease the demand for LPs at retail â with independent retailers “disproportionately affected” by the practice because “they often lack the resources and negotiating power to compete with larger chains or online platforms”.

In an Open Letter calling for an end to the practice, the US independent record store community and the US independent record label community, write that it “undermines the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and accessibility that are fundamental to the spirit of music itself”.

The letter, printed in full below, reads: “By restricting pre-sale opportunities to yourselves, record labels create a two-tiered system that privileges certain consumers over others.”

The letter adds: “This not only fosters feelings of exclusion and frustration among music enthusiasts but also perpetuates inequalities within the industry.

“Independent retailers, in particular, are disproportionately affected by this practice, as they often lack the resources and negotiating power to compete with larger chains or online platforms.”

Approximately 70 prominent US-based independent record stores, including Amoeba, Bull Moose, Electric Fetus, Fingerprints, Grimeyâs, Newbury Comics, Reckless and Waterloo, have signed up to the Open Letter, authored by US independent retailer, Rough Trade (Rough Trade Retail LLC).

The American Association of Independent Music (A2IM), representing over 600 independent music labels, has also supported the Open Letter.

President and CEO of A2IM, Dr. Richard James Burgess, said: âA2IM supports this call for a more equitable pre-sale system.

He added: “Independent record stores are the backbone of our music communities and stifling their access to new releases hurts fans and artists alike. Let’s celebrate music together, not create barriers to its enjoyment.”

Stephen Godfroy, Director and Co-Owner of music retailer Rough Trade in the US, said: âThe voice of US indie retail deserves to be heard and respected.

âThankfully, this discriminatory D2C practice has yet to become routine across the board, but nevertheless, weâre addressing labels that represent some of the most popular artists in the new release recorded music market.â

âEven a D2C pre-sell exclusivity window of a few hours from LP announcement can significantly decrease the LP demand at retail, let alone several weeks, as has been the case with some recent high-profile LP releases.”

âReceiving A2IMâs support on this issue is a welcome sign of the music ecosystem uniting with shared values. We hope the rest of the US label community pledges to follow suit.”

Dear Esteemed Music Record Labels,

As stakeholders in the vibrant and diverse music industry, we – the undersigned members of the global music independent retail industry – appreciate the efforts put forth by record labels in nurturing talent, producing quality music, and ensuring its distribution to eager audiences worldwide. Your dedication to fostering creativity and sharing artistic expression enriches our cultural landscape and enhances our lives in countless ways.

However, we are writing to you today with a plea for reconsideration of a practice that has become increasingly common within the industry: preselling new music releases exclusively via your artist/label Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) channels, before making them available for wider (independent) retail community to offer. While we understand the commercial âfirst to marketâ advantage benefit it provides yourselves, it ultimately undermines the principles of fairness, inclusivity, and accessibility that are fundamental to the spirit of music itself.

Music is a universal language that transcends boundaries and brings people together. It serves as a source of solace, inspiration, and joy for individuals from all walks of life. As such, we firmly believe that everyone should have an equal opportunity to access and enjoy the latest releases from their favorite artists.

By restricting pre-sale opportunities to yourselves, record labels create a two-tiered system that privileges certain consumers over others. This not only fosters feelings of exclusion and frustration among music enthusiasts but also perpetuates inequalities within the industry. Independent retailers, in particular, are disproportionately affected by this practice, as they often lack the resources and negotiating power to compete with larger chains or online platforms.

Moreover, exclusive pre-selling arrangements hinder the collective celebration and anticipation that surrounds the release of new music. Music is meant to be shared and experienced communally, fostering a sense of connection and belonging among fans. When pre-sales are initially limited to just the artist/label stores, this sense of community is greatly diminished, and the overall impact of the release is diminished.

Therefore, we urge you to reconsider the current approach to pre-selling music releases and to embrace a more inclusive and equitable retail model. By making new releases available for presale to all retailers simultaneously with D2C, you not only level the playing field for businesses of all sizes but also reaffirm your commitment to serving the interests of music lovers everywhere.

In conclusion, we recognize the challenges and complexities inherent in the music industry, and we commend your ongoing efforts to adapt and innovate in response to evolving trends and technologies.

However, we believe that true progress is measured not only by financial success but also by the values we uphold and the impact we have on society as a whole. Let us work together to ensure that the joy of music remains accessible to all.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
