Borussia Dortmund veteran Sebastian Kehl is hoping for one final trophy in the DFB-Pokal final before he retires.

The 35-year-old announced in March 2014 that he would retire this summer and Dortmund will be hoping to send the German off with one final trophy in their last game of the season.

Dortmund face Wolfsburg in the final of Germany's most prestigious cup competition on May 30 at Olympiastadion Berlin.

'I've always wanted to go out on a high level,' saidKehl at a press conference.

'It's great. You can't write a better script, with a final in Berlin and possibly a trophy in my hands.

'When I made the decision, it wasn't clear how the year would pan out and I was wondering whether it was the retirement I'd like.

'It's the right time to stop. There's only a few days until I enter the stadium for the last time. It will be emotional.'

The defensive midfielder has spent 13 years at the club, making more than 250 appearances since his arrival from Freiburg in 2002.

Kehl was part of the Bundesliga-winning teams of 2002, 2011 and the club's league and cup double in 2012.

The German has also enjoyed a successful career with his national side earning 31 caps, with his last performance coming in the 2006 World Cup held in his own country.
