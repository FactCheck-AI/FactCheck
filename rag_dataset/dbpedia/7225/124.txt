Growing from its 2001 launch with a pair of stores in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and Glendale, California, Apple now has more than 500 retail locations all around the world. In its stores, Apple sells standard Apple products along with a wide range of accessories, both first and third-party.

Apple hosts "Today at Apple" sessions at its stores to teach customers how to better use their Apple products, and the company also offers in-store repairs and support at the "Genius Grove."

The majority of U.S. stores operate within indoor shopping malls, while some stores are standalone locations along busy streets or shopping areas. Apple also has a number of flagship stores worldwide, considered by many to be architectural wonders, including its iconic Fifth Avenue glass cube in New York City, Tower Theater location in Los Angeles, and Regent Street store in London, England.

The Apple Store tag covers everything from new retail developments to unique products that Apple offers.
