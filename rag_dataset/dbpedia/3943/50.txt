Did you know that what we now know as Pride Month started back in 1969, with the Stonewall uprising?

Why is it called the Stonewall Uprising?

Also known as the Stonewall Riots or the Stonewall Rebellion, it is named after the events at the Stonewall Inn in New York on 28th June 1969.

What happened?

After a violent police raid in the early morning hours of 28th June, the patrons, staff, and neighbourhood surrounding the Stonewall Inn fought back by way of protesting.

This wasn't the first time police raided the bar - it was a common experience for many patrons of LGBTQ-friendly venues at the time.

Over the following days, rioting and protests took place, with activist groups demanding the right to live freely and openly regarding their sexual orientation.

Why did it happen?

There had been growing tension between the LGBTQIA+ community and the police for decades.

For the patrons of the bar, all they wanted was to be able to live authentically as themselves. They were not able to do so simply because of their sexual orientation.

Stonewall Legacy

The fight for LGBTQIA+ rights was already burning in the background at the time of the Uprising, with Stonewall adding fuel to the flames and bringing the fight to the forefront.

LGBTQIA+ rights groups were founded in the light of Stonewall, and the first anniversary of the Uprising saw America's first gay pride parade take place in Manhattan.

We celebrate Pride Month to celebrate the diversity of love, and people being able to live authentically and remember those who have fought and continue to fight against oppression.
