HI I’M ALI

I’m an American filmmaker and video editor based in Amsterdam, NL. I work with clients worldwide.

I edit stories about REAL PEOPLE like the residents in a small Adirondack town that are rallying to save their beloved Christmas theme park, pioneering AIDS activists from ACT UP fighting for their lives, or

a student from rural Sudan who founded a nonprofit to end violence in his hometown.

I’m just wrapped up editing 5 seasons/26 episodes of Tell Me More with Kelly Corrigan for PBS.
