Aiming to clean up the campaign-finance issues that have dogged her early campaign for governor, Attorney General Martha Coakley on Tuesday formally replaced her sister as treasurer of her state campaign committee with Gov. Deval Patrick’s campaign treasurer.

In a filing recorded with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance on Tuesday, Coakley named Paul Brountas Jr. treasurer of her state campaign committee, turning to the man who handles the accounting for the Deval Patrick Committee and also serves as the compliance officer for the Massachusetts Democratic Party.

The letter filed with OCPF was signed by Coakley and Brountas earlier this month on Nov. 15. Brountas replaces Anne Gentile, who previously worked as treasurer of both Coakley’s federal and state campaign committees, though she was only paid through the federal committee and volunteered her services on the state account.

Coakley has come under fire over questions about her use of federal campaign funds for state purposes. The attorney general’s campaign has previously said Gentile would be replaced, according to media reports, and her federal campaign account will be dissolved.

On Sunday, The Sun called for an investigation into Coakley’s campaign-finance dealings.
