The first Slovak coins were gold staters imitating the coins of Alexander II of Macedon issued by Celtic tribes in the third and second centuries BC. Roman coins circulated in Czechoslovakia until the fall of Rome. No coins were produced locally until Duke Bogeslav I (929-967) issued denars. The silver mines of Bohemia enabled local rulers to issue a large number of silver denars. King Wenceslas II (1278-1305) took advantage of the huge silver deposits of Kutna Hora to issue the Pragergroschen, equal to 12 denars, which became the standard coin for Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages. Under the Hapsburg rule, coinage was produced specifically for Bohemia until the death of Empress Maria Theresa in 1780.

Czechoslovakia was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the country gained its independence on October 28, 1918. Slovakia unilaterally declared independence on March 15th 1939; the remainder of Czechoslovakia was occupied by the Germans, who referred to the occupied area as the "Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.√É¬¢√¢‚Äö¬¨√Ç¬ù The Czechoslovak Republic was reconstituted on April 3, 1945, only to be separated into the Czech and Slovak Republics on January 1, 1993.

Austro-Hungarian Kronen circulated in Czechoslovakia until it gained its independence in 1918. The Czech Koruna (CSO) was introduced on February 25, 1919. Germany introduced Reichsmarks in the Sudenten districts of Czechoslovakia in October 1938 and introduced them in Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939. The latter became the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, in which they introduced a new Koruna at par with the Czech Koruna. German Reichsmarks also circulated in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. Hungary occupied southern Slovakia in October 1938, and Carpatho-Ukraine in March 1939, and circulated Pengos during their occupation. Poland occupied Teschen in October 1938 and issued Zloty during their occupation. Slovakia was given its own currency, the Slovak Koruna, which initially was at par with the Czech Korona and equal to 10 Reichspfennige. On October 1, 1940, a new parity was established, devaluing the Slovak Koruna to 1 Reichsmark equal to 10 Czech Koruna or 11.62 Slovak Koruny. German Reichsmarks also circulated in Slovakia during World War II. The government and the Narodna Banka Slovenska (Slovak National Bank) issued banknotes during World War II.

The Soviets issued their own Koruna (CSR) during their occupation of Czechoslovakia, but it was replaced by a new Koruna once Czechoslovakia had in theory regained its independence. A Hard Koruna (CSK) replaced the new Koruna at the rate of 1 Hard Koruna equal to 5 New Koruna on June 1, 1953. This Koruna remained in use until January 1, 1993 when the Slovak Koruna (SKK) replaced the Czechoslovak Koruna (CSK) at par. See also Czechoslovakia.

The Korun is divisible into 100 Halierov (Haleru). Banknotes were issued by the government between 1919 and April 1, 1926 and between 1938 and 1961. The National Bank of Czechoslovakia began issuing banknotes on April 1, 1926. The National Bank was nationalized on March 11, 1948 and renamed the State Bank of Czechoslovakia in 1950. The Narodna Bank Slovenska is the sole note-issuing authority for the Slovak Republic.
