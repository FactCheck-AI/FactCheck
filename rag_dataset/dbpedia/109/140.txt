Revol Porcelain France

Saint-Uze, France

Revol's been around for a while—we're talking since-1768-a-while. During a walk in the Drôme countryside, the Revol brothers, Joseph-Marie and François, noticed some unusual white streaks on the ground which they quickly identified as a kaolin clay deposit. They established a factory in the area and since then have been producing and exporting their beautiful porcelain. Vive le Revol!
