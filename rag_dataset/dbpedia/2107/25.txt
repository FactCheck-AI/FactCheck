The country gained independence from British colonial rule on October 1, 1960, and adopted a republican constitution in 1963. The political structure of Nigeria is characterized by a division of power between the federal government and the individual states.

The federal government of Nigeria is responsible for national-level governance, including defense, foreign affairs, and economic planning. It is headed by the President, who is both the head of state and the head of government.

In Nigeria, power is shared between the federal government and the 36 states, each having its own government and political structures. This division of power is essential for ensuring effective governance and representation at both the national and state levels.
