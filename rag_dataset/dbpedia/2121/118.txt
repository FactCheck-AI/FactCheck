Artful Dodger have announced details of their fourth single and debut album, which are set for release in November.

The single is the follow-up to the Top Ten hit ‘Woman Trouble’, which featured guest vocals from Robbie Craig and Craig David, and is entitled ‘Please Don’t Turn Me On’. The guest singer this time around is Lifford, who had a minor chart hit as frontman with the band Public Demand, whose ‘Invisible’ went into the Top 40.

‘Please Don’t Turn Me On’ will feature mixes from The Artful Dodger and hotly tipped two-step breakbeat duo The Stanton Warriors.

The single will be followed up by an album entitled ‘It’s All About The Stragglers’. The album will include all the previous singles. “It will not be a Now That’s What I Call Artful Dodger album,” explained the Dodger‘s Mark Hill. “It’ll be a collection of classic songs with great vocals.”
