History[]

In 1.0.0, this station had 2 platforms with 4 terminus tracks. This station was also isolated from the rest of the Victoria Coast Line by a tunnel to the next station, Longbow Beach.

Trivia[]

Before Version 1.1.0, one of the station signs on Platform 1 read "Stepford Victoria". This is a reference to the Stepford Victoria station in Stepford County Railway, another Roblox train game.

The sign was removed after the update.

The station used to be a lot bigger during Version 1.0.0 with four platforms.

This station is based off of Newhaven Marine before its closure in 2020.

This station and Freston Junction have the most characters in their name, at 15.

In real life, there is a harbour with the same name in Hong Kong, China.

Before Version 1.0.0, this station was called Victoria's Harbour.

This is the only terminating station that does not have any Semi-fast services.
