The abandoned and derelict 1847 building on the Seaford-bound platform at still open Newhaven Harbour station, seen from 313211 calling with a service from Seaford to Brighton on 15th April 2023. This disgraceful eyesore should either be demolished, even though I am all for preserving historic railway buildings, or preferably restored a.s.a.p. It cannot make people feel very safe waiting here for a train, especially after dark, surely? See image 27974 taken here in 1961.
