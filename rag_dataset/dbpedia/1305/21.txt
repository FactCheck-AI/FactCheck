Lyrics

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT

WE WANT FREEDOM JUSTICE AND EQUALITY

WE WANT THE BEST OF LIFE AND ALL IT BRINGS

NOW I DONE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD

AND EVERYBODY FEELS THE SAME

IT’S A UNANIMOUS DECISION

I SAID WE’RE READY FOR A CHANGE

YEAH YEAH YEAH

DON’T YOU KNOW YOU

GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE

GIVE IT UP

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT

CAUSE ITS ABOUT TIME FOR THINGS TO GET BETTER

WE WANT THE TRUTH THE TRUTH AND NO MORE LIES

WE WANT FREEDOM JUSTICE AND EQUALITY

WANT IT FOR YOU AND I WANT FOR ME

YOU YOU YOU

YOU GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE

GIVE IT UP

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT

DON’T YOU KNOW YOU

GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT

THE PEOPLE WANT BETTER EDUCATION NOW

RIGHT NOW

THE PEOPLE WANT BETTER FOOD TO EAT

THE PEOPLE WANT

BETTER HOUSING

PEOPLE NEED MONEY MONEY

PEOPLE NEED EQUALITY

PEOPLE NEED UNDERSTANDING

PEOPLE NEED FREEDOM

PEOPLE NEED HEALTHCARE

YOU BETTER GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

LIVIN IN THE SEQUEL

AND STILL NOT EQUAL

END UP SPENDING ALL YOU GOT WITH NOTHING TO SPARE

SOCIAL SERVICES CHILD SUPPORT AND WELFARE

FOLKS NEED A TAX BREAK OUT HERE

AND MOST FOLKS NEED HEALTHCARE

MODERN DAY SLAVERY

MENTALLY DRAINING ECONOMICALLY

WE WILL WIN

THERES HOPE IN THEIR EYES

CAUSE THEY REALIZE

YOU BETTER

GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT

GIVE EM WHAT THEY WANT 3X
