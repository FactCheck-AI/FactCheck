The former Bristol Rovers and Newport County defender was appointed in February of this year following structural changes within the academy.

Oliver Jefferies will take interim charge of the Under-18s until a new appointment is confirmed.

The Under-18s are back in action on Saturday when they travel to face Watford in the Professional Development League. (1pm).
