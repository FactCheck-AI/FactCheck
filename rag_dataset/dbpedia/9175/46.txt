CORROSION OF CONFORMITY has been diligently working on their follow-up to 2014's IX offering. The as-yet-untitled long player will be helmed by longtime producer John Custer, who's recorded such prior COC classics as Deliverance, Wiseblood, America's Volume Dealer, and In The Arms Of God. The record will mark the band's studio reunion with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan and their first full-length record together since 2005. A Fall 2016 release is expected.

CORROSION OF CONFORMITY emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012's self-titled album and 2014's IX to wide acclaim, but many fans have been eagerly and patiently awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.
