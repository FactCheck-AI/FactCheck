CORROSION OF CONFORMITY has been diligently working on their follow-up to 2014’s IX offering. Helmed by longtime producer John Custer, who’s recorded such prior COC classics as Deliverance, Wiseblood, America’s Volume Dealer, and In The Arms Of God, the record will mark the band’s studio reunion with vocalist/guitarist Pepper Keenan and their first full-length record together since 2005.

CORROSION OF CONFORMITY emerged from hibernation as a trio and released 2012’s self-titled album and 2014’s IX to wide acclaim, but many fans have been eagerly and patiently awaiting the return of Pepper Keenan.

The band was originally an influential hardcore punk/heavy metal crossover act before reaching critical success with a then new lineup on 1991’s Blind album. That trajectory continued with wider appeal as Keenan took over as the group’s primary vocalist on Deliverance (1994) and Wiseblood (1996). These two recordings in particular fused the raw energy of their previous albums, with some great strides forward in classic rock inspired songwriting and more spacious production and execution. Since then the band has often been copied but rarely equaled. This juggernaut gained mass and momentum with relentless touring alongside such greats Metallica, Clutch, Eyehategod, and many more. Eventually, following the release of In the Arms Of God in 2005, Keenan decided to focus all his energy on his hometown band Down…until now.

CORROSION OF CONFORMITY is:

Pepper Keenan – vocals, guitar

Woodroe Weatherman – guitar

Mike Dean – bass, vocals
