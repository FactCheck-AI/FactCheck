A year ahead of firing off the official gun for its Formula 1 movie starring Brad Pitt and directed by Joseph Kosinski, Apple Original Film on Friday made it official Friday that the movie is, natch, titled F1. In addition, a teaser poster was dropped. There’s also a sneak peek coming of the movie Sunday at the Formula 1 British Grand Prix.

Warner Bros. landed the distribution deal for F1 and has already announced the pic’s release date of June 27, 2025 in North America and June 25, 2025 abroad.

See the poster below.

Pitt plays a former driver who returns to Formula 1 alongside his teammate (played by Damson Idris) at APXGP, a fictional team on the grid. The movie is being shot during actual Grand Prix weekends as the team competes against the titans of the sport. The cast includes Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, Tobias Menzies, Sarah Niles, Kim Bodnia and Samson Kayo.

Top Gun: Maverick filmmaker Kosinski directs and produces the feature alongside Jerry Bruckheimer and Chad Oman of Jerry Bruckheimer Films; Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner for Plan B Entertainment; and Lewis Hamilton under his Dawn Apollo Films banner. The film is made in collaboration with Formula 1 and the F1 community, including the 10 F1 teams and their drivers, the FIA and race promoters. Copper CEO Penni Thow serves as executive producer.
