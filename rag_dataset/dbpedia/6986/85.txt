LEWISTON–A festive holiday-themed La Rencontre luncheon has been planned for 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 8, at the Franco Center. The event will include a lunch and live holiday music in its downstairs Heritage Hall. Historical exhibits related to local history will be on display.

La Rencontre (the gathering) is not restricted to French-speakers or even those of Franco descent. All are welcome to attend this event. Denise Scammon, development/marketing director at the Franco Center, said, “French cultural programs are an important resource for the community and state. Four different news stations have contacted us this year as such a resource. La Rencontre is supported by FACE Foundation, TV5 Monde, and the Quebec Delegation.” Future La Rencontre events in the 2022-23 season at the Franco Center will be held on March 9, 2023 and June 22, 2023.

Lunch is at 11:30 a.m. and will consist of tourtiere, salad, and pudding.

After lunch, Present Company will provide entertainment. Members of this trio are three Franco-American cousins from Lewiston: Lorna Jollymore, Diane Meservier, and Margaret Dix. They have been performing together in public as Present Company for almost 35 years. Their singing will be accompanied by Jollymore on the keyboards.

Tickets for La Rencontre must be purchased by noon on Monday, Dec. 5, and are $15. Tickets will not be sold at the door. The price includes the meal and entertainment.
