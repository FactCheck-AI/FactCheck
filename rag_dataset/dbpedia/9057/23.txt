Opaque Turquoise Vinyl

This Time Next Year by The Movielife

With numerous tracks on compilations, an LP, two 7"s, and a split CD under their belt, The Movielife practically became a household name with the great response they received from "This Time Next Year." The album is a harmonious mix of the catchiest parts of pop and indie rock blended together with a noticeable hardcore edge. "This Time Next Year," featuring the production of Brian McTernan (Snapcase, Cave-In, Texas Is The Reason), had people talking everywhere. New pressing now available on opaque turquoise vinyl.
