Hanna-Barbera’s Casper and the Angels originally ran Saturday mornings on NBC from September, 1979 to May, 1980. 13, 30-minute episodes were produced.

The show brought Casper the Friendly Ghost into the 22nd Century and made him the guardian spectre for two motorcycle policewomen; Minnie and Maxie. As per usual, Casper was loath to scare anyone, so his bizarre ghost buddy, Harry Scary assisted with the work of frightening the villains.

I have only the vaguest memories of this show. How about you? Were you a loyal viewer? You can catch the show’s intro below. Have an unforgettable Funshine Friday!
