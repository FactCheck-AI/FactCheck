The first look of Shahid features him as a rugged man who is seen sitting in a room and working on something. Prime Video wrote on their official Instagram page, “#FarziOnPrime: A small-time artist working out of his grandfather’s printing press has designed the ultimate con job – a crime uniquely suited to him – and gets pulled into the murky, high stakes world of all that it demands. A fiery, unorthodox task force officer has made it his mission to rid the country of the menace this poses in this fast-paced, edgy one-of-a-kind thriller.”
