Bill Johnson, aka “The Dream Dean”

After 34 years in higher education, I decided to call it quits on June 30, 2023.

In this next chapter of my life, I can summarize what I’m all about in this one sentence:

“I help people find purpose and meaning in their lives so that they can help others do the same.”
