Canonical announced its plans for Ubuntu for Phone over 2 years ago, and all that work may finally pay off, as BQ Readers will soon launch Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, the first Ubuntu smartphone that’s based on the company’s Aquaris E4.5 smartphone running Android 4.4.

BQ Aquaris E4.5 (Ubuntu Edition) specifications:

The Android version of the phone sells with a micro USB to USB cable, a power adapter and some documentation, and the company also provides documentation, firmware, and drivers & utilities on Aquaris E4.5 product page. Some source code is also available on github.

With that type of hardware, you can’t expect to get the phone / desktop convergence promised by Canonical, when they announced Ubuntu on phones and tablets. so I assume this will come a little later, maybe next year, with beefier hardware, and more work on the software front.

BQ and Canonical will also go with a limited launch at first, with flash sales in several countries in Europe, somewhat following the steps of OnePlus One without the invite system. Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition will cost 169.90 Euros, the same price as the Android version, and the exact time of the launch will be announced on Ubuntu and bqreaders Twitter accounts, as well as Ubuntu G+ and Ubuntu Facebook within the next week.
