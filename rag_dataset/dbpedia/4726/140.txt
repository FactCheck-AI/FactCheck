Earlier this year Canonical, the developer of the Ubuntu Linux distribution, began selling a smartphone that uses Ubuntu as its operating system. The BQ Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition was available only in the European Union, however, as was a follow-on phone released in June, while a third model was available only in China. As of today, BQ’s Ubuntu phones are available worldwide . If you live in the US, however, you may not want to rush out and buy one. Canonical says that “network frequency, and mobile operator, compatibility in some countries, such as the US, will limit some of the handset and OS functionality that European users are presently enjoying.”

Very Nice! I dont think I will be ditching my Nexus 5 anytime soon, but this one may be worth looking into if the price is right.
