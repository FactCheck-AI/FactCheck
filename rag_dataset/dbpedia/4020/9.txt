Our Lady of Lebanon Church represents the spiritual, social and cultural epicenter of the Maronite Catholic community in Nova Scotia. Our mission is to grow in and live by the Christian Catholic faith as well as to provide and to strengthen the Maronite traditions and culture. We aim to continue the growth of our Maronite Catholic identity; to give back to the rest of society; to maintain strong bridges with other cultural and religious communities and most importantly to draw ourselves closer to God.

The Maronites in Nova Scotia have always looked to the mountains of Lebanon for a place of refuge, and to the Mediterranean Sea for an open horizon to follow in the footsteps of their Phoenician ancestors to a new world where they will find freedom, tranquility, peace of mind and the ability to continue their evolution and expand their knowledge.
