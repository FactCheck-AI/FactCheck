Turner died Dec. 8 at age 62 of complications from metastatic colon carcinoma, and he had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease listed under other significant conditions, according to the medical examiner. The manner of death was deemed natural.

Atherosclerosis is the hardening and narrowing of arteries caused by cholesterol plaque in and on the artery walls, and cardiovascular disease means heart disease, according to the Mayo Clinic.

His mother mourned his death in a tribute on Instagram on Friday.

“Ronnie, you left the world far too early. In sorrow I close my eyes and think of you, my beloved son,” she wrote.

His wife, Afida Turner, also shared a tribute on Instagram.

“I did the best to the end this time I was [not] able to save you,” she said.

She called her husband “a true angel” and shared her heartbreak that his death comes after the passing of several other family members.

“This is a tragedy u with your brother Craig and your father Ike Turner and Alline rest in paradise… So unfair,” she wrote.

Ronnie Turner’s brother Craig Turner died by suicide in 2018. His aunt Alline Bullock, Tina Turner’s sister, passed away in 2010. His father, Ike Turner, died in 2007.
