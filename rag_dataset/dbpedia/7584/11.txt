The tables below give annual averages for snowfall at cities, resorts and mountains in Switzerland. Each place has a total for how many days of fresh snow it usually gets in a year and for the normal amount of snowfall.

The calculation of days only includes the days when new snow totalled at least one centimetre (0.4 inches).

The total snowfall is an average of weather data collected during 1981 to 2010.
