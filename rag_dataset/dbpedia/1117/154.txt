To chase his blues away, a modern day musical theatre addict known simply as 'Man in Chair' (Bob Martin) drops the needle on his favorite LP ï¿½ the 1928 musical comedy The Drowsy Chaperone. From the crackle of his hi-fi, the musical magically bursts to life on stage, telling the tale of a pampered Broadway starlet who wants to give up show business to get married, her producer who sets out to sabotage the nuptials, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a pair of gangsters who double as pastry chefs.

The musical opened to mixed reviews; "Small and ingratiating musical" (The New York Times); "Little, horrifyingly pastiche musical." (New York Post); "The happiest surprise of the Broadway seasonï¿½ (The Hollywood Reporter); "A disarming, delightful soufflï¿½ ." (The Associated Press); "I was delighted to be outside in fresh air." (New York Theatre Guide)
