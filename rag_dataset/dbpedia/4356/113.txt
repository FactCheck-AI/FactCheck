Needs tuning

Tried it out and liked it. Wasnât sure how it would be going from a satellite tv system to You Tube but I donât notice any big differences except a lower monthly bill and not having to call constantly with problems. Not real happy with the volume blowing me out of the room when commercials come on. Wish they would fix that. I like watching some of the VODs but have noticed that when a commercial comes on it frequently goes in the streaming circle mode and wonât resume my program. Canât wait for some other channels to get on board, weâll see. Overall happy with my choice to switch over to You Tube TVð

Still waiting for more channels. Not a lot more just a few more. Really I donât know how much longer I can take the high jump in volume when the ads come on. I get it, you want me to know there is an ad on. Ughð«

Worst streaming tv app ever

The design of the app is just plain stupid. Number one you canât delete a show you have recorded. No other streaming app is like that. Why do you make users put up with the clutter of months n months worth of shows? It says shows remain until they expire. Yet the disappear at random. I have shows only a month old that just vanish yet another has sat there for 9 months now. If you set it to record a show it sets it to record it on every channel that show is on. Thatâs stupid. I set it yo record a football game and every game with that team records. Iâm get recordings of the Dallas cowboys that are months and ever years old. I donât want those. You can set it to record only new shows. Thatâs stupid. It records dozens and dozens of old shows and you cant delete them either. I could go on and on. No thought at all was put into this app. Itâs clumsy. Takes lots of steps to get anything done and itâs design makes no sense. Itâs almost as it they sat down and said. Just how stupid and backwards can we make it. It that was the goal mission accomplished.

Add features

Two features needs to be added. Delete and profile tabs

Delete button is necessary to have when you no longer want a program to be in your library. Even though it is cool to be able to keep a recording for nine months before it drops out it is also necessary to add a delete button to delete shows or program you only want to see once and not sit there for a long time before it drops out. Being able to delete programs what you want to watch one time is a must have as the nine months thing should only apply to the program you want to keep that long. Please make that change and add a celete button to delete programs you want to watch only once.

Profile button should be added so that instead of sending invitation to family members and make it hard to be added doing that, adding a profile button is a better choice that way you can click on add profile and just enter the name of that person that way they can start using it. It is that simple. The way it is is too complicated.
