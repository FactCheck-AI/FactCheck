Another day, another remake. Deadline is reporting that Universal Pictures has acquired remake rights to Matt Osterman's Phasma Ex Machina, originally titled Ghost from the Machine, a US short film that was released on DVD just last year. Instead of bringing on Osterman to direct, Universal is putting Gary Shore, an up-and-coming director behind The Cup of Tears (trailer for that), in the director's seat for the remake, along with Nathan Parker to write. If all goes as planned, this will be next for Shore before he moves onto any other projects, including a feature version of Cup of Tears. I've never heard of any of this, what gives?

I haven't seen Phasma Ex Machina (or heard of it before today) but here's how Deadline describes it. The film "ponders the grey area between life and death and how science can bridge the two. The protagonist is a young man who is raising his little brother after their parents die in a car crash. His desire to bring them back prompts him to invent a machine designed to be a conduit to the grey beyond, and his success proves dangerous to himself and everyone around him." While that sounds interesting, I took a look at the trailer (seen below) and wasn't impressed, this doesn't look half as good as Primer, Timecrimes, Moon or any other debut sci-fi-ish drama. But maybe that's what they want to do - fill in that other half. Or maybe they just don't know what they're doing at all. Here's the original trailer for Matt Osterman's Phasma Ex Machina:
