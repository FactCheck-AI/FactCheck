Barbra Streisand and James Brolin have been married for 25 years and counting.

The two were first set up in 1996, and tied the knot two years later.

Barbra Streisand and James Brolin (father of Josh Brolin) are one of the longest-married couples in Hollywood. After being set up on a blind date in 1996, the two got married a couple years later, and have been going strong ever since.

The couple have supported one another during major career moments, but also weathered the initial COVID-19 lockdown together. And in Streisand's new memoir "My Name is Barbra," released in November, she shared more details about her relationship with Brolin.

Here's a timeline of Streisand and Brolin's iconic romance.
