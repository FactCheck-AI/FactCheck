Unicorn test pressing LP

Artist: Unicorn

Title: None

Record Company: Capitol Records

Catalog Number: None

Matrix Information: None.

Pressing Date: August 10, 1976

Release Information: Capitol Records test pressing on acetate. This test press includes a different song order than appears on any Unicorn albums. Slightly different EQ on the songs.

Pat Martin of the band Unicorn wrote about this test pressing:

"This is an acetate of the original finished version of One More Tomorrow produced and engineered by David Gilmour and recorded at the Floyds then brand new studio at Britannia Row, London. I sat next to David, except when I was playing bass or singing harmonies, all the way through the recording of this album. I was kind of trying to learn the ropes and the stuff I learnt came in very handy when I produced and engineered the Shed sessions. The album was totally recorded and mixed at Britannia Row and as all the Floyd's equipment was set up in the studio we got to use it. So this is Pink Floyd's equipment, set up for recording Animals, being played by the Unicorns. If you listen closely you can hear that, especially Rick's Hammond organ, it had a particular sound to it. Also Kevin used David's stage Stratocaster guitar in some sections. I used Roger's Precision bass on some stuff too.

"When the finished product was given to EMI Harvest, their executives said there wasn't a single on it. David was busy at the time and they decided, in their wisdom, to get another producer in to try and get that elusive hit single. Bruce Welch was approached first but was busy too. They then asked Muff Winwood, brother of Steve and former member of the Spencer Davis group, who was doing productions for Island Records at their Basing Street Studios, London. Muff heard the Gilmour version of the album and came down to the Shed to see us. He liked the band and he liked the sound in the Shed even suggesting that it might be a good idea to bring the Island Mobile Studio down to the Shed and record us there. That idea was knocked on the head due to my parents long suffering neighbors who had to put up with a band rehearsing in the Shed since 1965. We just couldn't expose them to a massive truck blocking up the narrow street.

"It was decided by Muff and our management that the album needed four tracks that could be singles. Muff suggested redoing "Get Along Fine" and actually routined it with us (the acetate version will be the original version) and suggested how it should be arranged. He also liked a new song Ken had just written called "New Shoes." He said we needed to do two songs by other writers. Ken came up with "Have You Ever Seen The Rain" by Creedence Clearwater and our management with "Slow Dancing." We ran through all the songs in the Shed with Muff checking that the arrangements were right for singles. We then had some time booked in Islands Basing Street Studio and recorded and mixed the four tracks there. At the time we were there, Bob Marley and the Wailers were recording in the studio next door. They must have been very poor because I often saw them sharing the same huge cigarette (grin)."

"The album, with the four Muff produced tracks was then released on Harvest in the UK, by Capitol in the USA, and on EMI International for the rest of the world. So on this acetate you have a rare different arrangement of "Get Along Fine."

Side One: Give & Take, One More Tomorrow, The Night, Get Along Fine, Nothing I Wouldn't Do.

Side Two: So Hard to Get Through, Eric, British Rail Romance, Magnolia Avenue, I'm Alright (When I'm With You), The Way It Goes.
