The Polish Zloty (PLN) is the official currency of Poland.

The name “zloty” means “golden” in Polish, as it originally referred to a gold coin.

The modern zloty was introduced on January 1, 1995, as a result of a currency reform that replaced the old zloty (PLZ) at a rate of 10,000 old zloty to 1 new zloty.

The National Bank of Poland (Narodowy Bank Polski) is responsible for issuing and managing the zloty.

Subdivisions and Denominations

The Polish Zloty is subdivided into 100 smaller units called grosz.

Coins are issued in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 grosz, as well as 1, 2, and 5 zloty coins.

Banknotes are available in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 zloty.

Exchange Rate

The Polish Zloty has a floating exchange rate, which means its value against other currencies is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand.

Factors that can affect the value of the zloty include inflation, interest rates, economic growth, and geopolitical events.

Challenges and Prospects
