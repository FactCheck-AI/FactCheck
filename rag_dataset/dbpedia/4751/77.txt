American Airlines' recent route expansions have focused on international flights — including new upcoming service from Philadelphia (PHL) to Budapest (BUD) and Prague (PRG), from Chicago (ORD) to Venice (VCE) and from Dallas (DFW) to Reykjavik, Iceland (KEF).

But today, the world's largest airline is unveiling new domestic routes and the addition of new shuttle service between Chicago's O'Hare (ORD) and New York City's LaGuardia (LGA).

Chicago-NYC Shuttle Service

Less than a month after Delta announced the shutdown of its West Coast shuttle route, American Airlines is adding new shuttle service "between the Windy City and the City that Never Sleeps."

With this rollout, AA will run 15 flights each weekday between Chicago's O'Hare (ORD) and New York City's LaGuardia (LGA). Designed for busy business travelers, AA shuttle flights allow passengers to check in up to 20 minutes before departure if you aren't carrying checked baggage and up to 30 minutes before departure when you check bags. Also, there will be dedicated check-in desks and dedicated gates, so you'll know exactly where to go in the airport.

Shuttle services also offer the following enhanced amenities:

Free snack basket, beer, wine and spirits in First Class

Free snacks, beer and wine in Main Cabin

Free magazines and newspapers in the boarding lounge

This expands on American Airlines' east coast shuttle service, which now includes flights between Washington National (DCA) — NYC's LaGuardia (LGA), Washington National (DCA) — Boston (BOS), and Boston (BOS) — NYC's LaGuardia (LGA):

New Domestic Routes

American Airlines is also announcing new service on domestic nonstop routes, including:

Three routes from Philadelphia (PHL) to Fort Wayne, Indiana (FWA); Oklahoma City (OKC); and Pensacola, Florida (PNS)

New service from both Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) and Dallas (DFW) to Panama City, Florida (ECP) and South Bend, Indiana (SBN)

Service from Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD) to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pennsylvania (AVP)

These routes will be loaded into American Airlines' network on January 22, but travelers are going to have to wait until June 7 for flights to begin.

With this new announcement and previous route expansion announcements, American Airlines is adding 52 new nonstop routes from its hubs in 2018:
