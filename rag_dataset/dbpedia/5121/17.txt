Despite an official Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell remake reportedly being in the works by Ubisoft, this upcoming remaster is set to bring a new lease of life to the original stealth action title.

Originally released in 2002, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is the first entry in the Splinter Cell series that follows the activities of NSA black ops agent Sam Fisher.

Followed by six more main entries, the stealth action series by Ubisoft went on to receive critical success and despite not receiving a new entry since 2013, a remake of the first game was announced back in 2021.

However, while we wait for the long-awaited (and much-needed) remake, fans of the original title can check out this fan-made RTX Remix Mod for Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell.

Created by modder skurtyyskirts, this work-in-progress mod shows us what the 2002 title could look like with modern day graphics, including its path tracing effects.

To show us how the mod is coming along, its modder shared a 4-minute video over on Youtube which gives us a sneak peek at the beautiful remaster. By switching between the original and the new look, it is clear that it is a dramatic improvement which has fans excited to see the finished product.

“Freaking amazing. Flirts with photorealism at times. Can't wait till you're done,” one comment read.

Another said: “Looking really nice! I can see what you mean about the culling issues and I think the fire effects need some work and could be a lot brighter. Interesting to see the implementation of path tracing in this game given that the gameplay relies on you using the darkness to stay hidden.”

With the mod being a WIP, it is not available to download yet but I’m sure that will be the case when it is finally ready. Something else to look forward to as well as the official remake!
