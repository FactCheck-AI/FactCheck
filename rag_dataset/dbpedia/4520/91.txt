The Gambino Crime Family originated in Brooklyn, NY under the leadership of Pellegrino Morano, a Camorra gangster. The Camorra is a mafia-esque criminal organization which originated in the Campania region of Italy, rather than Sicily where the Mafia originated. After Morano's deportation in 1917 the gang began to follow a Mafia format. The Gambino Crime Family was once called the Mangano Crime Family because of its originally Godfather under The Commission Vincent Mangano. The Family would be renamed the Gambino Crime Family under the rule of Carlo Gambino, some members have been known to call the family the Gotti Crime Family, mostly those who are close confidants of the late John Gotti and his brother Peter.
