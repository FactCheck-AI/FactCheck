MediaCoder is a rich-feature audio/video batch transcoding tool, it can help you batch converting audio/video formats, and it is an open-source freeware.

Many MediaCoder integrate many excellent audio/video softwares which come from the open source community into a friendly graphic interface. In the video, it uses MEncoder as back-end, this gives full play to the MEncoderâ€™s rich characteristics; in the audio, it uses the input plug-ins of MPlayer and Winamp as decoders, and combined with all kinds of different encoders, so it can make a conversion among different audio formats, and automatically adds labels (tagging).

In addition, it can also convert audio tracks of video files itto independent audio files (such as VOB -> MP3), and can use all sorts of audio filters (such as resample, normalize, etc.)
