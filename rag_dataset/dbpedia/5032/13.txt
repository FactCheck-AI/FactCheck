Esplanade “La Rasude”

This project proposes to transform the old postal complex along the railway into urban terraces structured by the public esplanade “La Rasude”.

It completes the new museum hub located at the west of the station with a strong gesture of public urbanism to the east. The new public space offers clear access to pedestrians and thus improves the site in the urban fabric of the city.

The esplanade connects the “Place de la Gare” to the “Avenue d’Ouchy” and the “Montchoisi” district to the south-east. Offering a clear view of the Alps and visibility from the railway, the project creates a strong identity on a regional scale.

The four-star hotel is located at the “Place de la Gare” and marks a distinctive beginning or ending of the site. The office buildings and shops have street addresses of the “Avenue de la Gare” supporting the city scale. The commercial spaces are organized facing the “Place de la Gare”. At the neighbourhood scale, the alleys with entrances to the housings connect the avenue to the esplanade and allow visual connections. Like an urban beach, the public space gives the city access to the sun and the view.

This urban project is a composite of new and old buildings. Two groups of buildings per phase offer space for two large companies, and the plans can be flexibly adapted to smaller units. The residential units have a favourable orientation and a superb view. The realization can take place in two or more phases. Each step includes a mix of functions and contributes to a strong image value for the station area.
