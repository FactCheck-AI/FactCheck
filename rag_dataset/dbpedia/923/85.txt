Themes

Game-theoretical model: how to achieve cooperation

Cheater detection: how to tell the truth behind appearances

Commercial society versus the traditional agrarian society: resolving the conflict in a creative conceptual blend

The destabilization and reaffirmation of gender codes

Events in Book I

Joseph is dismissed for refusing Lady Booby's advances

Robbed on the way home, he is left for dead in a ditch

A lawyer in a coach saves him to prevent a lawsuit

Betty the chambermaid gives him a bed at the Tow-wouse's inn

The surgeon and parson Barnabas pronounce him dying

Parson Adams arrives and makes sure he recovers

Betty tries to seduce Joseph and ends up with Mr. Tow-wouse

A. Cooperation

Joseph doesn't want to give in to Lady Booby

The thief takes his money for nothing and beats him up too

The people in the coach at first see no reason to help him

Mrs. Tow-wouse thinks he's not worth taking care of

Joseph's failure to enlist people's cooperation almost kills him

The Problem of Cooperation in Game Theory

Joseph (player B)

Cooperate

Defect

Cooperate

A provides service and gets

benefit (R)

A provides service but gets no benefit (S)

A

B accepts service and pays

cost (R)

B accepts service but pays no cost (T)

Defect

A provides no service but gets

benefit (T)

A provides no service and gets no benefit (Z)

B gets no service but pays

cost (S)

B gets no service and pays no cost (Z)

T = Temptation

R = Reward for cooperating

Z = Zero outcome; no cooperation

S = Sucker's payoff

T > R > Z > S

The thief falls for Temptation and leaves Joseph with a Sucker's payoff

The people in the coach worry about Sucker's payoff and prefer no cooperation (Z)

Mrs. Tow-wouse worries about Sucker's payoff and prefers no cooperation

Parson Trulliber worries about Sucker's payoff and prefers no cooperation

Logic keeps pushing people towards Z/Z: no trust, no cooperation. In this way, people avoid the worst outcome (S)--but fail to realize what would be better for all (R/R). Scoundrels keep trying for T, the best of all outcomes.

The problem of any community: how to realize the benefits of cooperation, or move from Z to R.

What makes it even more difficult is what is known as Banker's Paradox: the bank will lend you money only if you can prove you don't need it.

Joseph becomes victim to the Banker's Paradox: he's really in trouble and needs help badly--and this is precisely when people are the most reluctant to help him, because they're worried they'll be stuck with a Sucker's payoff

Parson Adams' Solution to the Cooperation Problem

In Richardson's Pamela, the actions of the heroine could be interpreted to be basically selfish--as Fielding's parody Shamela shows

This morality doesn't overcome the Banker's Paradox, since you would only help people who can provide you with significant advantages

In Joseph Andrews, Fielding wanted to propose a more radical morality: always cooperate, on the basis of

Empathy

Empathy means to be open to experiencing another's distress, which will lead you to cooperate even if the favor cannot be instantly (or ever) reciprocated, at least not personally

Parson Adams showed "a great deal of emotion at the distress of this poor creature" (50), before he knows it is Joseph

He holds "it was the duty of men of all professions to apply their skill gratis for the relief of the poor and necessitous" (51)

He says of the second inn-keeper, who shows no compassion for Joseph's bruised leg, "he believed the devil had more humanity" (99)

He asks Trulliber to lend him money "which, peradventure, I shall return to you" (140)

He argues we should "forgive others their debts" (184)

He is "the good parson, whose heart was naturally disposed to love and affection" (145)

He "always sympathized with his friends on [sad] occasions" (189)

In contrast, Mrs. Tow-wouse shows "an insensibility to human misery" (160)

If most people are empathic and compassionate, this works as insurance: the risk is spread out, and on average everyone is much better off

As Adams puts it at the end of the book, the aim is "not only to defeat the designs of our enemies, but even to turn their hearts" (265)

That is, to move not from Sucker's payoff to Zero (which is the main concern of the unvirtuous characters), but to a stable cooperation.

The empathic strategy, however, is vulnerable to cheaters, who consistently fall for Temptation and leave you with a Sucker's payoff

Since nobody has infinite resources, nobody can survive a long string of Sucker's payoffs--Joseph is cutting it very close

Parson Adams doesn't deal with cheaters very well--he is too gullible

B. Seeing through appearances, cheater detection

The second book is a string of people who are not what they seem

Parson Adams is not very good at seeing though people

He sees no further into people than they desire him to

This makes him extra vulnerable to the Sucker's payoff

Events in Book II

Adams walks off and Joseph is stuck with the bill for the horse

Adams hears the two lawyers blame and praise a justice (the pretend virtue of truthfulness)

Slipslop rescues Joseph; in the coach they hear the story of Leonora

Adams encounters the self-proclaimed patriot (the pretended virtue of courage)

He rescues Fanny from rape before he knows it's her--but almost gets killed

The assailant manages to stick the blame on them (the pretended virtue of the innocent victim)

They are recognized at the justice's and released, and walk to the next inn

Fanny faints when she hears Joseph, and Adams throws his Aeschylus on the fire

Joseph and Fanny meet, and Adams dances for joy

Adams visits Trulliber, the avaricious parson who pretends to be a man of charity (the pretended virtue of charity)

They encounter the man of false promises (the pretended virtue of magnanimity or generosity)

Adams and the alehouse keeper discuss book learning and life experience

At this point, Joseph begins to assert himself:

Adams' gullibility has got them into trouble again--they're stuck with the bill

Joseph knows Adams is wrong to believe that "knowledge of men is only to be learnt from books" (150)

Nor do we have much reason to rely on his conviction that "a skilful physiognomist will rarely be deceived" (155)

In the next book, the whole sequence with the Roasting Squire demonstrates that Adams lacks the ability to detect deception

The doctor, for instance, "could laugh inwardly without betraying the least symptoms in his countenance" (211), tricking Adams into a tub of water

The moral of this is that Joseph cannot rely on Adams alone: society is not what Adams thinks it is, and poses a set of problems that are not all solved in old books

C. Literature as a Social Reference Library

Developmental psychology

Humans tend to look to others--elders and peers--for guidance for how to behave

A six month old infant crawling on a glass floor with a 'visual cliff' will pause and look to the mother

If the mother shows anxiety, the infant will retreat and maybe start crying

If the mother smiles and nods, the infant will crawl onto the glass--in spite of its fear of heights

Evolutionary psychology

For much longer than recorded history, human beings have lived in tribes of around a hundred people

A vital aid for survival has consistently been the knowledge obtained from others in the group--typically elder teaching

Humans are biologically disposed to acquire culture--to look to others, rather than continually reinventing the wheel

Empathy is the cognitive adaptation for solving the cooperation problem--but culture, or elder-teaching, determines how it is activated

Human cooperation is enabled by empathy and regulated through emotions such as affection, goodwill, gratitude, trust, and confidence; and also guilt, anger, fear, and resentment

The Historical Village Community

Renaissance society still has elements of the tribal community

Most people still live in villages--perhaps 90%

Even in the cities, craftsmen live in guilds, or stable neighborhoods

A single morality--or standard of behavior--is preached from the pulpits

The world was imagined to be a single coherent body--the Great Chain of Being

The Late Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries

Society is conceived of as a mechanism rather than an organism

Massive urbanization: people move into spaces without real communities

Trade becomes a significant new source of wealth

Economic efficiency creates room for social mobility and independence

The aristocracy loses its idiological dominance

The new society needs a new set of morals

The Birth of the Novel

People are looking for a set of social reference points to orient themselves

Richardson's Familiar Letters sets out to do this--a form of elder teaching

It grows into a novel, Pamela, which functions as social reference

Since "examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts" (13), the novel--or "biography" as Fielding calls it--is a more effective form of elder teaching than moral treatises

The Hollywood bankrobbery on Friday appears to have been scripted in the movie Heat, down to the costumes

Fielding claims "emulation inspires our imitation in an irresistible manner" (13), and focuses on describing good individuals

Deceitful behavior will also be depicted, "to hold the glass to thousands in their closets, that they may contemplate their deformity, and endeavour to reduce it" (159)

The kinds of things that can go wrong are depicted, and the cause is frequently a lack of good advice:

Leonora ends in a pickle because she gets poor advice from her aunt

The female narrator of the story deplores the "blameable levity in the education of our sex" (109)

Mr. Wilson imputes all his misfortunes to an "early introduction into life, without a guide" (170)

But Joseph Andrews does more than describe human nature, or give a stock set of rules of behavior. It provides--in the figure of Joseph, the hopeful hero of the emerging middle class--a way of working out a solution that did not exist before.

Events in Book III

Adams, Joseph, and Fanny get scared by lights and voices

They are invited in to Mr. Wilson's house to rest

He tells them his story of the Rake's Progress

This is how he becomes a good judge of character, and learns to see through false appearances--such as the coquettes, who "are never what they seem" (177)

Mr. Wilson in a man of the world who has deliberately constructed his life in the country, drawing on the best of both worlds and creating his own

They depart and are entertained by the Roasting Squire

Ill treated, they flee and take in at The New Inn

The squire's men come to kidnap Fanny, and succeed

She is freed by Peter Pounce, Lady Booby's steward

They cover the final miles to Lady Booby's parish

Commercial society versus traditional agrarian society: resolving the conflict in a creative conceptual blend

The Novel is the space where the ideology of the middle class is developed

Wilson, the Gentleman Farmer, embodies the virtues of the self-sufficient man--with money deriving from the wine-business in London

Desire is acceptable if its gratification does not destabilize the social order

Compassion and empathy is reduced by the insulation provided by a retirement from the world--the forerunner of suburbia--and tempered by skilful cheater detection

At the end, Joseph "declares he will imitate [his parents] in their retirement" (298)--we here have the social referent of choice

D. Reaffirming Destabilized Gender Codes

Events in Book IV

They all arrive at Booby-Hall

Lady Booby is still torn between love and pride

She tells Adams to prevent the match; he refuses

She enlists lawyer Scout to get rid of them; he acquiesces

Her nephew Mr. Booby and his wife Pamela arrive

As Joseph and Fanny are about to be sent to prison, Mr. Booby frees them

Lady Booby is jealous of Fanny and schemes to get rid of her

She talks her nephew into trying to convince Joseph; Joseph stands firm

Beau Didapper accosts her and kisses her on the street

His servant pimp tries to buy her and rape her, but is beaten by Joseph

Mrs. Adams advices the parson to stay out of trouble

Adams advices Joseph not to love Fanny too much

The pedlar saves his son Dick from drowning

Lady Booby and Beau Didapper comes to visit the parson's house

Dick reads them the story of Leonard and Paul

Beau offers Fanny settlements and starts fondling her

Joseph boxes him on the ear, but a fight is averted

The pedlar announces that Fanny is Joseph's sister

Slipslop informs Lady Booby that Beau's servants will kidnap Fanny

The project is dropped when they find out she is Fanny Andrews

The whole gang spends the night at Booby-Hall

Beau goes to rape Fanny, but ends up in Slipslop's bed

Slipslop holds on to him and cries rape

Adams comes and beats up the masculine Slipslop

Lady Booby discovers them both naked

Adams returns to his room, but ends up in Fanny's

Joseph finds them (innocently) together in the morning

Gammar Andrews reveal the babies had been exchanged

Mr. Wilson testifies that Joseph is his lost son; Lady B leaves in agony

They all go to Mr. Booby's place, celebrate the wedding, and undress Fanny in front of the narrator, "discovering, not putting off, ornaments" (297), unlike Shamela, who is "with all the pride of ornament cast off" (305).

After a pleasant wedding night, Fanny gets £2,000 from Mr. Booby, Adams a living of £130 a year, and Joseph and Fanny settle near his parents.

Reaffirming Destabilized Gender Codes

In Book I, there is the assumption of a symmetry of gender codes:

Female mistresses desire their servants as much as male masters desire their maids

Women (Lady Boody, Slipslop, and Betty) are attracted to men exclusively because of their external appearance and youth, just as men are conventionally attracted to women for their youth and beauty

Women attracted to men desire to sleep with them instantly, just as men conventionally have little inclination to delay consummation

Male servants have has much reason to preserve their 'virtue' (chastity) as female maids do

At the end of Book I and throughout Book II, the traditional gender codes begin to reassert themselves:

Betty's active desires are diverted to make her the "the vanquished one" who "quietly submitted to her master's will" (72)

Mrs. Tow-wouse is furious, but mainly at Betty, and quickly composes herself; his infidelity is no very serious matter

Leonora makes a fatal female mistake: she is inconstant, and spends the rest of her life bemoaning it

Horatio still loves her, she is (for what we know) still a virgin; the mere knowledge she has loved another spoils her in the respectable marriage market

Fanny is rescued from a rapist, after a violent fight: a lot is clearly at stake

When Fanny and Joseph meet, Fanny is shy and coy, Joseph forward and eager

In Book III, the value of Fanny's virtue in general and virginity in particular comes to the fore:

Women do wisely to consider "the many occasions on which the strength of a man may be useful to you" (163), most notably to keep other men off

She is more frightened of men than ghosts (165)

Mr. Wilson's youth demonstrates what happens to young girls who don't take care of their virtue

He ruins a girl promised in marriage to a humbler but better man; her mind is ruined by the company of other kept mistresses, she steals money from him and leaves him, and ends up as a prostitute

The unfaithful wife is abandoned by her husband, and Mr. Wilson's fondness for her does not last

Finally, the constant Harriet Hearty wins all his affection, gets him out of prison, marries him, and has children with him--the perfect glue in a companionate marriage ("for what union can be so fast as our common interest in the fruits of our embraces?" (191)

The Roasting Squire's designs to rape her heighten the sense of the pivotal value of her virginity; Joseph, tied to the bedpost, agonizes over her "untained innocence" (225)

In Book IV, the continued fuss about Fanny's virtue is supplemented by these final elements:

Gammar Andrews knowledge about Joseph not being their son that she conceals from her husband

How can a husband be sure that his wife's child is his?

Perhaps men are obsessed with female virtue because men who didn't care much ended up raising other men's children?

Fielding proudly announces Fanny is pregant at the end--and the implication is that Joseph can't possibly have anything to worry about
