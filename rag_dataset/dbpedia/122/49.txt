Ultra-protective, endlessly configurable, and easily accessible, Peak Design Camera Cubes take the hassle and nerves out of traveling with photo, video, or drone gear. All-new V2 models dial up the ruggedness and ease-of-use with enhanced weatherproofing, improved access, new sizes and honed aesthetics based on years of user feedback on our best-selling original Camera Cubes, which are still available for 20% off while supplies last.

Designed to fit perfectly in any Peak Design Travel Bag or nest in your 3rd party bag, Camera Cubes give you custom organization and protection for creative gear ranging from small mirrorless kits to full pro video, photo, and drone setups. A range of different protective, low-profile FlexFold™ dividers give endlessly customizable organization. The expanded main opening gives total visibility and access to your gear, and features removable padding so you can tuck the flap away for faster access when the cubes are packed in your bag. Medium and Large cubes feature dual side zips, letting you access gear from the side access points of your 45L Travel Backpack (sold separately). Smedium, Medium, and Large cubes include a 'floating pocket' for filters, lens caps, and small stuff. Our V2 Camera Cubes are more protective than ever, featuring weatherproof #8 Ultra Zips™, weatherproof taping on external seams, and a recycled, Bluesign-approved 160D nylon canvas shell.
