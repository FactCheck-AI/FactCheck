A Comparison of Various Methods

In theory one can design a true four dimensional analog of Rubik's Cube (3x3x3x3). While one cannot make a working model of this puzzle in the real world, one can project its image into three dimensions which can then be displayed, manipulated and solved using standard 3D computer graphics You can find MAGIC CUBE 4D on the web. It was designed and constructed over a period of several years by Daniel Green and Don Hatch with later help from E. Jay Birkenbilt.
