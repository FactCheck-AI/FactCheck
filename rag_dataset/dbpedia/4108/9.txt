John Guillermin’s The Towering Inferno is one of the defining disaster movies of the 1970s. The Paul Newman/Steve McQueen led film is an epic piece of film-making and John McTiernan’s Die Hard owes quite a bit to Guillermin’s all-star 1974 release. The impressive supporting cast for The Towering Inferno includes William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, O. J. Simpson, Robert Vaughn, Robert Wagner, Dabney Coleman and Jennifer Jones.

Based on the novels The Tower and The Glass Inferno, the Irwin Allen production was nominated for eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor for Fred Astaire and Best Score for John Williams.

The Warner Bros and 20th Century Fox co-production was a massive success in 1974 and The Towering Inferno grossed $116 million in the US and $203 million globally.
