Multi-screen measurement specialist Rentrak has extended its International Box Office Essentials service to India, through a partnership with Asian MR firm Majestic MRSS, which will collect daily theatre-level attendance and ticket sales information across the region.

Box Office Essentials and International Box Office Essentials are used by studios in the US and distribution organizations around the world. Last November, Rentrak extended the International service to Malaysia and Singapore, and with the move in to India, the company now collects box office information across 36 countries.

Raj Sharma, co-founder and President (Global) of Majestic MRSS comments: 'India is a huge box office market and one where studio returns are steadily increasing. In order to effectively conduct business in the global theatrical industry, clients want visibility into our region and Majestic is thrilled to be working with Rentrak as the world leader of box office intelligence.'
