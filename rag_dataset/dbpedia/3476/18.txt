A Kentucky woman is even more enthusiastic about being an adidas employee than Kanye West.

Lottie Williams, who currently works as an outlet salesperson, has been employed by adidas for most of her life. According to the WDRB report, she's collected more than 400-500 pairs of sneakers bearing the 3-Stripes during that timeframe. Sure, some of that could be chalked up to perks of the gig, but she wears her unique commitment to the brand on her sleeve.

"I would allow them to paint my car and put the adidas logo on my car and drive around with it," said Williams.

Not only is Williams faithful to adidas —she never buys shoes from brands like Nike, Reebok or Pro Keds. What draws her to adidas the most?

"By far, the technology in the shoe out beats any shoes," said Williams. "I think your shoes should pop and it should match your personality. I think it should define who you are. And, I'm a very fun, outgoing person."
