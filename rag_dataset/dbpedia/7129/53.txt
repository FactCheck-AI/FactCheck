It is believed that sometime before 1724 the Spaniards built the original Flat Bridge with logs. Eventually, flooding from the Rio Cobre destroyed it. Legend has it that slaves rebuilt it, and there is a story that the ghosts of all those who drowned there gather at the bridge every Good Friday. The current bridge was built sometime betwen 1881 and 1915. Research is sketchy, but it is said that material from the original May Pen Bridge was used.
