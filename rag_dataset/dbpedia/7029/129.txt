Serving as both sequel and prequel to the original, THE GODFATHER, PART II is the rare follow-up considered en par with the original, and the first sequel to win Best Picture. With two parallel stories - the rise of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) and the ascent of Michael (al Pacino) - THE GODFATHER, PART II is a complex web of intrigue, violence and betrayal. Winner of six Academy Awards.

DCP - Paramount Pictures.
