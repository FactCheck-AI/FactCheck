Finnish "hybrid metallers" SHADE EMPIRE have entered studio to begin recording their fourth album. According to the band, "The drums and majority of guitars have [already] been recorded. The rest of the instruments and vocals will be [tracked] during [the] spring. Mixing process is scheduled to begin at the first weeks of May by Aksu Hanttu."

A studio diary has been launched at this location.

SHADE EMPIRE in 2010 parted ways with Dynamic Arts Records after releasing two albums through the label.

SHADE EMPIRE issued its third album, "Zero Nexus", in March 2008. Most of the recording sessions took place at Studio 33 in Kuopio, Finland and this time the band used a real choir to boost the sound. The vocal recordings at Perkele Studios were overseen by producer and AJATTARA mastermind Ruoja (a.k.a. former AMORPHIS frontman Pasi Koskinen). The CD was mixed by Sami Niittykoski.
