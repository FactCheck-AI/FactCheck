ROK-UN Relations

The Republic of Korea was established in 1948 and its government was recognized by the United Nations through the General Assembly Resolution 195. The United Nations played a key role in the birth of the Republic of Korea through such missions as monitoring the first general election and other reconstruction programs.

When the Korean War broke out in June 1950, the United Nations intervened, under Security Council Resolution 82, by sending armed forces to repel the Communists' aggression. It was the first undertaking of its kind in the history of the United Nations.

Since the armistice of 1953, the Korean issue had been one of the most controversial subjects of debate between the western and pro-Soviet blocks at the UN. Applications by the Republic of Korea to become a member of the UN were blocked. It was only in 1991 that both the ROK and the DPRK were simultaneously admitted to the UN as the Cold War structure of global politics receded.

Since its admission to the UN, the ROK has made significant contributions to the work of the UN through peacekeeping operations, development and the promotion of human rights. The Rok was elected twice as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1996, and again in 2013. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon served as the 8th Secretary-General of the UN from 2007 to 2016. In 2002, the ROK became the 9th largest contributor to both UN Regular budget and to UN Peacekeeping Operations budget.
