This copy comes from Darwin’s library at Down House in Kent; he died on April 19, 1882. It is a reprint of the sixth edition of Origin, the last one overseen by Darwin himself and the first to use the phrase “survival of the fittest.” Annotations in this copy are in the handwriting of Darwin’s son Francis (1848-1925); the signature at the top of the title page indicates the classification system Francis had developed for Darwin’s library (note the deleted word “Study” on the left). In the footnote on p. xx, Francis Darwin corrects the misspelled name “D’Alton” to Dalton, a correction eventually adopted in editions that appeared after Darwin’s death. This edition, the first one to use standard green cloth binding, appeared in July 1882.
