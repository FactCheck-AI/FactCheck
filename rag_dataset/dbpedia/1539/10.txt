Here's big treat for listeners this week as we briefly shift from our standard style to post two brand new interviews! Our first is with Susie Dietter, a legend of The Simpsons, Futurama, and modern animation in general. Susie joined The Simpsons in season 2, directed classics like Radioactive Man and Grade School Confidential, plus Futurama eps like Godfellas, AND she was the first woman to ever direct an episode of The Simpsons. Learn all about that milestone moment and so much more in this honest, illuminating discussion with this talented artist!

And be sure to stay tuned for another new interview on Friday!
