Shoegaze pioneers Slowdive have confirmed that they’ve been working on a new album. The group have recently been sharing photos from the studio via Instagram, accompanied with the hashtag #slowdivelp5. Singer Rachel Goswell was the first to drop a hint, posting a picture of the band’s drumkit five days ago, which was followed by a photo of Nick Chaplin on his bass, and most recently, Neil Halstead playing guitar. Check out the photos below.

The new album, which still has no release date or title attached to it, will mark the band’s fifth studio LP. Slowdive reunited for a series of reunion shows back in 2014 and released their self-titled comeback record in 2017. Since then, each member has mostly been working on other projects: Rachel Goswell joined the Minor Victories and contributed to The Soft Calvary, while Neil Halstead has been working as a producer, most recently with LA-based harpist Mary Lattimore.
