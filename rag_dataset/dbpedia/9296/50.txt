A beautiful 1959 mono first pressing of Miles Davis’s masterpiece Kind of Blue, the best selling jazz album of all time–for good reason, with an all-star band featuring John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb.

The very lightly played deep groove 6-Eye label disc is in Near Mint/Near Mint to EX+ condition. The album plays beautifully, with Mint to Near Mint audio. Stamper numbers are 1 AL/1 AE.

The correct thick cardboard cover is in EX condition, and incorrectly lists “Flamenco Sketches” as the fourth track and “All Blues” as the last track, however, the labels list the tracks in the correct order. Cannonball Adderley’s name is misspelled on the front and back cover, and the number 4 is printed on the back cover in the bottom right corner. With vintage grey/off white Columbia innersleeve.

This album is from the collection of Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend Tommy Hawkins, a dedicated jazz fan.

A beautiful first pressing of an essential album.
