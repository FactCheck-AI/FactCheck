Britain’s most senior police officer, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson, quit Sunday following allegations that police had received bribes from The News of the World to stay silent about phone hacking. Stephenson said he had no knowledge of the extent of the practice and his integrity was “completely intact.” Stephenson has been criticized for hiring former News of the World executive Neil Wallis, who had been questioned by police regarding the hacking, and Stephenson said his connection to Wallis could hamper the investigation. Stephenson’s resignation comes on the same day that former News International chief Rebekah Brooks was arrested in connection with the alleged phone hacking.
