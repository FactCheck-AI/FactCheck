As you may recall, Christophe Gans is developing a Silent Hill film reboot as part of Konami's initiative to relaunch the series across multiple forms of media:

Christophe Gans gives an update on new SILENT HILL movie; eyeing 2023 release? News

As you may recall, Christophe Gans expressed an interest in making a new Silent Hill film in 2020 and stated that he was working on a script. https://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18687475.html Well, per French magazine Jeuxvideo, Christophe Gans just gave an update and...

Christophe Gans (director of the first Silent Hill movie) confirms that Konami is working on several Silent Hill games and projects

I debated if I should be the one to make this thread or not, but it is new news. Christophe Gans, the director of the 2006 Silent Hill movie (had no involvement with the 2012 Silent Hill Revelations 3D) sat down for a 50 minute video interview with JEUXACTU (French website) because his movie...

He recently dropped an update while talking to French magazine. The film (which Gans has described as a reboot and a standalone story) is nearly fully storyboarded and will take inspiration from Hideo Kojima's Silent Hills: Playable Teaser.

The filmmaker has not thrown in the towel. His next project? A new Silent Hill, still in collaboration with the Japanese executives, who intend to regain control of their franchise after the Revelation 3D sacking :

"There, I have practically finished the storyboards for this new Silent Hill and there are indeed a few nods to PT [legendary Silent Hills demo canceled, ndlr] because, obviously, it made us all dream ."

Le Pacte des loups, Silent Hill... Christophe Gans, pionnier du blockbuster à la française

Sur le point de revenir sur les plateaux de tournage pour un nouveau Silent Hill, Christophe Gans a donné la folie des grandeurs au cinéma français, et pas seulement avec ses réalisations. Le Pacte

After how awfully he butchered SH's setting and lore the first time, I don't really have much faith here.

Also this. I feel like this is going to wind up yet another of the dozens of video game adaptations that are constantly "in production" but never actually shoot a single frame of footage.

The first Silent Hill movie actually had a lot going for it. Much of my core issue with the movie is that it's wrapped up in a huge exposition dump in the end (and the ending was terrible, too). But the look of the movie was spot on.

Okay, who's gonna post Christophe Gans' quote about Harry Mason this time?

I doubt his writing skills improved much, so not really interested in whatever he has to offer. Also, it probably won't get made anyway.

I hated his first SH movie so him not making another one is actually a fairly sizable reward to me. Though that's not why I think it isn't going to be made.

There will probably be an homage, like the protagonist getting lost in a looping hallway or something.

The first SH movie I understand that for the common viewer can be a bad movie. But for the saga fans actually is really a good movie because it followed (with some minor deviations sure) the game so well. Even the OST is all from the games.

Now the second movie is pure trash. Really that movie should never seen the light of the day.

Let's see what comes in this reboot.

I feel like SH2's story isn't exactly unique as far as movies are concerned, to be honest. It was unique in games when it was new but it's a pretty standard psychological horror narrative on the movie side of things.

Yup. Gans is extremely good at saying a whole lot of nothing in a whole lot of words while making it sound like he's doing it for the fans.

Honestly if you don't care about the games you're probably the ideal market for the first movie. It's a terrible adaptation of SH1, but it looks cool.

I trust Gans to keep me entertained again.

I actually really dig the first movie. It doesn't hold a candle to the games obviously but I don't know, I have a real soft spot for it. I love that scene where Rose runs past her husband in the other "dimension" in the school yard.

That being said, I'm not into his weird thing about "Horror isn't the same as in 2006". In my cynical head it translates to "I'm chasing trends", sorry in advance.

2006 was, however much it pains me to admit it, 16 years ago. Horror in, say, 1984 wasn't the same as horror was 16 years before that. In 1968 people were getting their heebiejeebies scared out of them by something as relatively slow and boring as Rosemary's Baby, while 16 years later we had The Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing who had all taken the genre further on. I don't think saying horror isn't the same today as it was in 2006 necessarily translates to chasing trends.

You know what, I think I just don't really even know what current Horror is, hence my kneejerk reaction because I don't even see how Silent Hill '06 would be dated now. I mean that outside of budgetary constraints and so on, the obvious stuff, but just looking at pacing, structure and so forth. Like a "what do you MEAN this was a long time ago!" moment.

I guess my "old and in denial" mental image was immediately Found Footage: Silent Hill, which is probably also woefully outdated by now lol. Nevermind the whole comment!

PS: On another note, I went to see the first SH three times because it was playing at the dollar theater.

The game never even got made, it's not even widely available as a teaser, it has nothing to do with Silent Hill aside from Reedus walking into the town at the end, I don't dig this. Stop putting IP names on things that are far removed from the IP, if you want to use the IP respect the source material and dance with the one who brung ya imo

It's absolutely crazy to think they'll base this on a cancelled game. Like, I feel violated by that. Either bring back PT or let it rest. We've suffered enough.

Ah, who am I kidding, I'll watch it. Still think the original Silent Hill movie was pretty good.

Basing a reboot of silent hill on a playable teaser for a cancelled game that is no longer available to anyone who didn't already have it. That is wild.

To be honest I don't even know what horror is myself these days :p I don't think the genre has evolved as much since 2006 as it did in my example between the 1960s and the 1980s, but I don't think saying it's not the same as in 2006 is necessarily chasing trends either. Personally I don't think SH '06 has aged poorly, but then again I'm an old fart who insists movies from the 80s have aged just fine besides SFX and such.

And good lord if they made a found footage Silent Hill I would throw my dentures and reading glasses at them!

I mean, in this case, it's because P.T. was going to be part of Silent Hill and we're talking about a Silent Hill movie lol.

Yeah, he just says a few nods. The title of the thread isn't exactly wrong, but it's a little misleading.

Honestly, I'm just interested to see what they do with the movie in general. Even when things don't work out, I like seeing what translates to the screen and what doesn't. So much stuff happens in Hollywood, whether it's things that work better in movies than in games or investors deciding "this wouldn't make as much money," so it's kind of fun for me to go in with no expectations just to see what they do. Sadly, I doubt we'll ever get an actually all-around good Silent Hill film.

I always thought it was the opposite. That fans of the SH series were more critical of the movie (Pyramid Head appearing in an SH1 story) and people not familiar with SH liked it for what it was, being their entry-level ticket into the franchise.

Yea but we've been there and done that. Wouldnt a silent hill movie be better based off of another idea from the games? Like The Room would be an incredible adaptation. It's way more interesting than the looping hell hallway of P.T.

Like I said the movie has some deviations from the original game. The Pyramid Head, the protagonist, some deviations from the story like Dahlia being a good mother but overall the atmosphere of the game was very present on the movie.

The OST of the movie is kinda like the greatest hits of the saga. The otherworld representation. The monsters. The Lisa scene. There is a lot of fan appealing and as fan of the game I was very happy with the movie at the time (I was teenager when it was released).

The second one forget that exists. It is bad. Really really bad. That final scene is so stupid.

I still remember that one moment in theater when I was with my friend to see the first SH movie and when the movie ended, I looked to my right at him and knew just from his expressions that he liked the movie as much as I did and right at that moment, some guy in front of us said :"Well, that was fucking bullshit"
