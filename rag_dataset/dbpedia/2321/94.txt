Naomi Segal invites you to discuss a story, ‘Excision’ (כריתה), by Israeli author Savyon Liebrecht.

Savyon Liebrecht (Hebrew: סביון ליברכט; born 13 January 1948) is an Israel author. She was born in Munich, Germany, to Polish Holocaust survivors as Sabine Sosnowski, the eldest of three children. She emigrated to Israel in 1950.

Excision
