Hire: OneRepublic

OneRepublic is an American pop rock band formed in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 2002.

The band achieved its first commercial success on Myspace as an unsigned act. In late 2002, after OneRepublic played shows throughout the Los Angeles area, several record labels approached the band with interest, but the band signed with Velvet Hammer, an imprint of Columbia Records.

On October 7, 2016, OneRepublic released Oh My My, their fourth studio album, which featured a number of collaborators, including Cassius, Peter Gabriel, and Santigold. Preceded by the singles “Wherever I Go”, released on May 13, 2016, and “Kids”, released on August 12, 2016, it was recognized as a change in their sound from previous albums by critics and by the band.

In 2017, the band released the singles “No Vacancy”, “Truth to Power”, “Stranger Things” with Kygo and “Rich Love” with Seeb. Their fifth studio album, Human, was released in 2021. The band has sold more than 16 million records worldwide.
