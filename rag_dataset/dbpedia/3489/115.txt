Cinedigm Entertainment Group and New Video have jointly acquired North American distribution rights to The Invisible War. Directed by Kirby Dick, the film won the U.S. documentary audience award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival in January. It will receive a theatrical release this summer.

Dick’s investigative documentary takes a devastating look at the rape epidemic in the U.S. military. Amy Ziering (Outrage, Derrida) produced the project.

The Invisible War is the first acquisition under the new partnership between Cinedigm and New Video to distribute independent films theatrically, on demand, digitally and via DVD/Blu-ray.

“We are honored that our first New Video/Cinedigm acquisition is The Invisible War,” said Cinedigm chairman and CEO Chris McGurk. “The film is incredibly powerful and deserves – in fact demands – to be seen by as many people as possible. We very much look forward to working with Kirby, Amy and their team to share this important film with audiences across the nation.”

Orly Ravid of The Film Collaborative and distribution advisor Jonathan Dana repped the sale for the filmmakers.

“In a highly partisan political season it’s refreshing to be working with a political story that is completely and profoundly bipartisan,” said Ravid. “The Invisible War has engendered overwhelmingly passionate response from women and men, military and civilians, as well as politicians on both sides of the aisle.”

Ro*Co Films is handling educational distribution and international sales for the picture; Film Sprout is handling non-theatrical distribution and The Film Collaborative is handling worldwide festival distribution. Independent Lens is the broadcast partner and helped finance the film.
