Passion for Christ - Compassion for All

++++++++PRAYER FOR UKRAINE++++++++++++

Most holy God and Father, hear our prayers for all who strive for peace

and all who fight for justice. Help us, today remember the cost of war, to work for a better tomorrow;

and, as we commend to you lives lost in terror and conflict, bring us all, in the end,

to the peace of your presence; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen
