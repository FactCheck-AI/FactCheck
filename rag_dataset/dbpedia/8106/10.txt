A bumper collection of produce was donated to Harlow Foodbank recently by the pupils of Summercroft Primary School.

As part of the schools Harvest celebrations, a special assembly was held in All Saints Church, Hockerill, to which parents were invited. The children sang songs and shared their thoughts about how we can help others.

Headteacher Michael Smith said –

“The children presented a moving and inspiring asssembly in music and word. They really got across the message of how we should help our neighbours in need. We were thrilled to once again support the Harlow Foodbank whose mission is to feed local people in crisis.”
