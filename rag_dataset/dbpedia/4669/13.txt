Dis- was a rock trio from Milwaukee, Wisconsin that broke up suddenly after the release of this record, their third. The Cd version of this record was released on Sonic Bubblegum and the covers were lovingly printed at Third Termite Press. This was the only Dis- record released in Lp format, after two Cds for Twelve Inch records. These days, Chris Fuller is a member of Sixto with Chris Manfrin and Craig Hutler of Travis.

"The Historically Troubled Third Album" was without a doubt the strongest and most interesting Dis- album, and it is a shame that things had to end for Dis- right in the middle of a period of time where they were becoming something very unique and compelling.
