George Harrison founded the Dark Horse Records label in 1974 as Apple was winding down. The label gave George the vehicle to continue his solo career on his own terms and also sign acts to the label that aligned with his philosophy. George’s first two signing where Ravi Shankar and Splinter. Albums by those and others have been filtering through BMG since January 2020.

Dark Horse is now run by George’s son Dhani. The label recently signed Cat Stevens and Billy Idol as well as back catalogues from Leon Russell and Joe Strummer.
