My guest for this episode is Aaron Badgley, who joins me to discuss his book on Dark Horse Records, the label started by George Harrison in 1974.

Aaron tells us the story of the varied collection of artists on the label, and how as a commercial venture, it wasn't quite what George had hoped it would be.
