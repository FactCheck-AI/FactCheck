IN India to play for his country, ace Pakistani batsman, Inzamamul-Haq, 23, also known as the Gentle Giant of Multan, is emotional. At Mohali, his eyes brim over in front of television cameras as he expresses his wish to go to Hansi in Haryana where his family migrated from in 1947. "I have to go there. I promised my father I'd bring him pictures. We have no relatives there but we did have a haveli. Dad said it was near a mazaar." In the Taj palace lobby in Delhi, he asks anxiously, "do you think anyone would remember my grandfather Pirzada Zia-ul-Haq by name there? Are there any Muslims left there anymore? Do you think they might have changed the name of the locality? Dad tells me it was called Pirzadgan. Others called it mohalla Moghalpura." The Pakistani cricket board did not permit him to go.
