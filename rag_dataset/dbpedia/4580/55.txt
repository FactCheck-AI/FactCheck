The French composer, Charles-Edouard Lefebvre, lived from 1843-1917. He studied at the Paris Conservatory and won the Prix de Rome in composition. His solo for oboe, Deux Pieces pour le Hautbois, is dedicated to the famous oboe teacher George Gillet. It was composed especially for the Concours at the Paris Conservatory in 1897. There are 2 short movements lasting a total of approximately 4.5 minutes. This is a great work for solo competitions and recitals.

This edition is based on the original publication of 1897 and is edited by Valarie Anderson. Obvious notation errors have been corrected and some articulation markings have been altered for consistency; but in so doing we have strived to maintain the original intent of the composer.

NOTE: An extra oboe part, with all measures prenumbered for the adjudicator in solo contests, is available. See JP1084a
