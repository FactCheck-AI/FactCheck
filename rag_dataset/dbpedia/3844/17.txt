The Lompoc region was first home to the Chumash, who lived in the Valley for nearly 10,000 years before European contact. The origin of Lompoc’s name (pronounced lom-poke) derives from the Chumash village place name, with various meanings such as lakes and lagoons. In 1888, the City of Lompoc was incorporated and established as a farming community and has since had a rich agricultural history. Just a 10-minute drive from the ocean, the Valley’s fertile soil and temperate climate make this region a prime location for growing asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, lettuce, artichokes, carrots, cabbage, celery, spinach, strawberries, kale, parsley, brussel sprouts, snap peas, cilantro, and walnuts.

While agriculture is the region’s number one economic driver, not everyone has equitable access to this bountiful harvest. Many residents experience barriers in accessing locally grown produce and report having felt unable to provide enough food to meet their needs. According to the 2021 U.S. Census, Lompoc’s poverty rate was 17.6% compared to Santa Barbara County’s 10.5% average.
