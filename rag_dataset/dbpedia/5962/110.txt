Since 1784, Derby Academy has remained true to its motto, “Improve Both Mind and Heart.” Our small class sizes, dedicated faculty, innovative curriculum, inspired arts, competitive athletics, and an array of community and leadership opportunities ensure students are challenged to learn and supported in their development.

Upon this foundation, our school builds a learning community with an “all-in” spirit. By exploring the amazing array of opportunities we offer, students discover hidden talents, unexpected interests, and build the confidence to face the future with boldness and curiosity.
