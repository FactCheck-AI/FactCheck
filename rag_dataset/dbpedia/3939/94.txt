Microsoft closes Live Search Books program

May 23 2008

Publishers Weekly reports that Microsoft has pulled the plug on its Live Search Books and Live Search Academic projects, and has taken down both websites. Through the programs, Microsoft has digitized 750,000 books and indexed 80 million journal articles. Those results will now be integrated into general search results. Effective immediately, Microsoft has stopped digitizing new materials in both its library scanning and in-copyright book programs.

The official word from Microsoft is that they "forsee that the best way for a search engine to make book content available will be by crawling content repositories created by book publishers and libraries."

Microsoft will be providing publishers with digital copies of their scanned books, and is working with Ingram Digital, which was doing much of the scanning, to provide publishers with sales and marketing opportunities for titles already in Live Search Books.
