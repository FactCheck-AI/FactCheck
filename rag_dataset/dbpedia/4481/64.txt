Leading Provider of On-Demand Business Management Suites Plans Continued Growth and Expansion in the UK and Europe as Cloud Computing Continues to Overtake Legacy, On-Premise Business Software Growth

London, U.K.—May 13, 2009—NetSuite Inc. (NYSE: N), a leading vendor of on-demand, integrated business management software suites for the mid-market enterprise and divisions of large companies, today announced plans to hold an online NetSuite Career Fair for former Sage UK employees and Sage UK employees who were recently offered voluntary redundancy by Sage management, (see the full story). According to The Times, Sage would cut a further 600 positions this year, on top of cutting 400 staff last year. About a fifth of the 1,000 jobs lost in 2008 and 2009 — from Sage's 14,500-strong global workforce — will be made in Britain as part of a drive to reduce annual costs by an estimated £50 million.

NetSuite is the world's leading provider of on-demand business management software suites, and a major force in the emerging cloud computing industry. The company has European headquarters in the UK and plans continued expansion of its workforce in the UK and across Europe, creating new opportunities for talented and experienced individuals to join a winning team with a bright future.

News that Sage had offered voluntary redundancy was perhaps a predictable result of the declining demand for on-premise software, as well as the company's poor rate of organic growth. According to IDC's 2009 software forecast, Software as a Service will experience over 40% growth while on-premise ERP will have <1% growth in 2009. Unlike Sage and many other on-premise software vendors, NetSuite has only a single code base to maintain and innovate, so NetSuite customers get all the benefit of a highly focused R&D effort designed to help them leverage and grow their investment. With more than 6,000 customers around the globe, NetSuite is the leading provider of ERP / CRM / Ecommerce business management suites for the mid-market enterprise and divisions of large companies.
