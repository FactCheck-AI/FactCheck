Global Scotland, the company behind Heart and Smooth FM, is delighted to be broadcasting from its new home in the heart of the city centre.

Radio stars Robin Galloway and Adele Cunningham enjoy waking up Glasgow on Heart Scotland Breakfast, as they watch the sunrise from the new West Regent Street office.

The state of the art studios enable Global Scotland to takes its place at the centre of Glasgow, having previously been based in an industrial estate in the east end.

The open plan office features a news room, board rooms and three studio booths which are each fitted with sound proof glass. The glass windows open up to a large balcony which looks out across the city.

Heart Scotland and Smooth Radio Scotland showcase some of Glasgow's best known presenters from Robin Galloway on Heart Scotland Breakfast to John McCauley on Smooth Breakfast.

The new offices were officially opened last night with a performance from X Factor winner Louisa Johnson.

The 18-year-old songstress played an acoustic version of song Tears and debut single So Good.

Managing Editor of Global Scotland, Gary Muircroft, told Glasgow Live: " It’s fantastic to be in new our state of the art studios here in the centre of Glasgow on West Regent Street.

"It’s going to be a pleasure to be working in the Heart of the city each and everyday.

"There’s no chance it could ever become mundane – with eight floor views right across the city, what seem like acres of room to be creative with my team and presenters, and seeing that look of awe as our clients arrive for the first time.

"I know the whole team are excited about broadcasting both Heart Scotland and Smooth Radio Scotland from here for many years to come!"
