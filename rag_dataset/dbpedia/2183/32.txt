Redzed and Acid Row will perform as part of the Black Sabbath celebrations at Kasárna Karlín on 27 June from 4:30pm. DJs Voodoo Beats will perform at the afterparty.

Celebrating the existence of one of the greatest music legends – Black Sabbath. A band that has inspired dozens of artists for generations and whose cult is still dying. Starring Redzed, one of the most successful local rappers of our time, and Acid Row, probably the busiest touring band. Two worlds that unexpectedly came together on collaborative cover versions of a famous icon living for one rare moment. The moment when they will play them together during a spectacular open-air show in Prague's Kasárne live. The musical feast will also be accompanied by the popular vinyl DJ's - Voodoo Beats - and the subsequent afterparty will be themed.
