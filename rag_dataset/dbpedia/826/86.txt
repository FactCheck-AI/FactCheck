Battle of The Network Reality Stars was a short-lived spinoff/remake of ABC's Battle of the Network Stars. The show consisted of 33 competitors from several different reality shows competing for cash and prizes.

Premise[]

This updated format of Battle of the Network Stars is complete with teams of sweat suit and speedo-clad reality stars that will partake in physically and aggressively competitive challenges that are reminiscent of the original series. TV's most cherished and loathed reality stars will compete in joust, navigate a kayak race and battle it out in the fame tug-of-war among other challenges. In a nod to today's reality shows, twists and turns along the way forces team members to vote each other off, create alliances and generate unending drama and tears.
