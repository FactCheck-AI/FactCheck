On November 12, 1923, Officer William D. Allen was off-duty when a neighbor reported to him that someone was stringing illegal radio wire to a house. Officer Allen investigated and located another neighbor tampering with a radio wire. Officer Allen picked up the wire, which then accidentally touched an overhead power line that transmitted a fatal charge of electricity through his body. His death was instant.

Officer William D. Allen is the earliest known United States Park Police officer to die in the line of duty. He was married and had a young child.

We honor his service and commitment to duty.
