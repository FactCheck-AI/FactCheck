Church (Anglican)

The Church of St John was built overlooking the town between 1889 and 1891, designed by Douglas and Fordham of Chester. The collapse of the tower in 1891 necessitated much rebuilding, and the building was consecrated in 1895. All of the stained glass in the church was made by C.E. Kempe's studio in London.
