Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, have a pretty epic love story! The pair first met back in the â€˜90s when they were students and realized their connection was one of a kind. Since their nuptials in 2010, the happy couple have made a few rare appearances together in the public eye.

The only child of Hillary and Bill Clinton followed in their footsteps when it came to her career, making her mark as a global health advocate, activist and author. Marc also comes from a family with political ties. His dad, Edward Mezvinsky, formerly served in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Pennsylvania native's mom, Marjorie Margolies, partook in two congressional elections and also entered the gubernatorial race in Pennsylvania in 1998.
