Chelsea Clinton Mezvinsky, daughter of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, announced late Friday on her official Twitter and Facebook accounts the birth of her and husband Marc Mezvinsky's first child together â€” and it's a girl.

At 11:32 p.m., she tweeted, "Marc and I are full of love, awe and gratitude as we celebrate the birth of our daughter, Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky."

Chelsea and Marc Mezvinsky were married in 2010.
