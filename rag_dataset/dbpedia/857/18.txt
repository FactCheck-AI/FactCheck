Be competent to determine a differential diagnosis and investigation plan appropriate to the presenting complaint of the child

Gain experience of core acute and long-term paediatric conditions

Students will have observed key clinical experiences: post take ward round, visit to a childrenâs centre/nursery, and following a patient and family through a day case visit

Students will be expected to complete core practical procedures: measurement of height and weight; measurement of blood pressure, temperature, head circumference, urinalysis

Fourth year students are able to consolidate skills gained in year three with additional focus on management of acute and chronic paediatric conditions and paediatric prescribing skills.

What's unique?

It is Europe's first children's hospital built in a park. The original Alder Hey buildings will mostly be demolished and the land reclaimed as new parkland for the surrounding community.

Features of Alder Hey Childrenâs Hospital include:

75% of beds are be single, en-suite rooms with beds for parents

Access to play areas, natural light and striking views of the park are available wherever possible

Children, young people and teenagers will have dedicated areas to play and relax

An emphasis on next generation technology will improve healthcare - from patient entertainment systems to keeping patient records and dispensing medicines by robot

It is one of the most environmentally friendly hospitals in the world

Children and young people were involved with the design of the new hospital.

Medical students have the opportunity to learn from novel patient shadowing experiences, for example following children attending for day case surgery and outpatient appointments. This allows students to gain invaluable insight into the experience of patients and family attending the hospital.
