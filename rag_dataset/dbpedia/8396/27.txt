Varahamihira was a brilliant Indian astrologer, mathematician, and astronomer who lived in the 6th century CE . He is considered one of the greatest minds of his era, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of astrology, mathematics, and astronomy in India and around the world.

Early Life and Education:

Varahamihira was born in Ujjain, an ancient city in present-day Madhya Pradesh, India. Little is known about his early life, but it is believed that he received an excellent education in astronomy, mathematics, and astrology. His profound knowledge of these subjects gained him recognition and respect in the scholarly circles of his time.

One of Varahamihira’s most famous predictions was that there was water on Mars. This prediction was made in his book “Pancha Siddhantika”, which is a treatise on astronomy and astrology. In the book, Varahamihira describes Mars as being “covered in water” and “having a watery atmosphere.”

Varahamihira’s prediction about water on Mars was made over 1,500 years ago, long before modern scientists had any evidence to support it. However, in recent years, scientists have found increasing evidence that there is indeed water on Mars.

In 2008, NASA’s Phoenix lander found evidence of water ice in the Martian soil. And in 2015, NASA’s Curiosity rover found evidence of flowing water on Mars.

The discovery of water on Mars has profound implications for the search for life on Mars. Water is essential for life as we know it, and the presence of water on Mars suggests that there may have been, or even still be, life on the planet.

Varahamihira’s prediction about water on Mars is a testament to his genius. He was able to make this prediction based on his knowledge of astronomy and astrology, and without the benefit of modern technology.

His prediction is a reminder that ancient Indian scientists were just as brilliant as modern scientists, and that they made many important contributions to the fields of science and mathematics.

In addition to his prediction about water on Mars, Varahamihira also made many other important contributions to astronomy and astrology. He developed new methods for calculating the positions of the planets, and he wrote extensively about the influence of the stars and planets on human affairs. His work was highly influential in India, and it was also translated into Arabic and other languages.

Varahamihira’s work is still studied by scholars today, and it continues to be relevant to the fields of astronomy, astrology, and mathematics. He was a brilliant scientist and thinker, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of these fields.

Here are some additional facts about Varahamihira:

He was born in Ujjain, India, in the 1st century CE.

He was a court astronomer to King Vikramaditya.

He wrote several important books on astronomy, astrology, and mathematics.

His work was highly influential in India, and it was also translated into Arabic and other languages.

He is considered one of the greatest minds of his era.

Contributions to Astronomy and Astrology

Panchasiddhantika — The Five Astronomical Canons

The “Pancha Siddhantika” stands as a testament to Varahamihira’s expertise in astronomy. Varahamihira authored the “Panchasiddhantika,” which translates to “Five Canons”. This monumental work is a compilation of five different astronomical treatises, including the influential Surya Siddhanta. Among its invaluable treatises, “Surya Siddhanta” holds a prominent place. This ancient astronomical text expounds on the true motions of celestial bodies, including the Sun, and lays the foundation for precise astronomical calculations. The Panchasiddhantika played a crucial role in shaping Indian astronomy and became a standard reference for centuries.

Estimations of Planetary Diameters

Varahamihira’s “Surya Siddhanta” encompassed estimations of the diameters of various planets, providing valuable insights into their celestial characteristics. Among the planets discussed were Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter. These estimations offered a glimpse into the scale of the cosmos, a remarkable feat given the limited technological resources of that era.

Stellar Positions and Eclipses

The “Surya Siddhanta” extended its brilliance beyond planetary estimations. Varahamihira provided the positions of stars beyond the lunar nakshatras, further enriching our understanding of the celestial sphere. Moreover, the treatise delved into the calculation of solar and lunar eclipses, enabling ancient astronomers to predict these celestial events with remarkable accuracy.

Timekeeping and Cosmology

Varahamihira’s “Pancha Siddhantika” delved into the concept of time in celestial terms. It explored the lengths of years for gods and demons, the day and night of god Brahma, and the elapsed period since creation. Furthermore, the work discussed the eastward motion of planets and their sidereal revolutions, providing a comprehensive understanding of cosmological dynamics.

The Solar System and Its Formation

Varahamihira’s intellectual brilliance extended to the creation and structure of the solar system. In his pioneering work, he was the first to expound on how each planet in the solar system is created by and revolves around the Sun, a revolutionary idea well ahead of its time.

Mars: A Mysterious Neighbor

Of all the planets, Mars has captivated human imagination for centuries. Varahamihira’s “Surya Siddhanta” ventured into the realm of Mars, presenting intriguing details about the planet’s diameter, circumference, and color. Remarkably, his calculations of Mars’ diameter were accurate within 11% of the currently accepted value, showcasing the precision of ancient Indian astronomical knowledge.

The Revelation of Water on Mars

Among Varahamihira’s awe-inspiring insights was his prediction of the presence of water on Mars. In his “Pancha Siddhantika,” he described the red planet as housing both water and iron on its surface. Centuries later, NASA and ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation) unveiled evidence confirming his prophecy.

In 2015, NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) provided compelling evidence of liquid water on Mars. Dark streaks called “recurring slope lineae” (RSL) were discovered on the slopes of certain Martian hills and craters, indicating the intermittent flow of briny water during the warm seasons.

Varahamihira’s legacy

Varahamihira’s legacy is one of brilliance, innovation, and influence. He was a brilliant scientist and thinker, and his work has had a profound impact on the development of astronomy, astrology, and mathematics. His work is still studied by scholars today, and it continues to be relevant to these fields.

Varahamihira is a reminder that ancient Indian scientists were just as brilliant as modern scientists, and that they made many important contributions to the fields of science and mathematics. His work is a testament to the power of human ingenuity, and it continues to inspire and amaze people around the world.
