Solar PV Analysis of Freiburg Im Breisgau

List of Solar PV Installers for Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany

Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany, offers a suitable environment for solar PV generation with varying levels of sunlight across different seasons. During summer, the average energy production reaches 5.52 kWh per day per kW of installed solar capacity; this figure declines to 2.81 kWh in autumn and further drops to 1.32 kWh in winter before increasing again to 4.72 kWh in spring. As a result, solar power generation is more effective during the summer months due to increased sunlight exposure.

Nonetheless, certain factors like heavy rain or snowfall could impact solar power generation at this location since these weather conditions can reduce available sunlight for electricity generation from solar PV systems. To mitigate these potential challenges and ensure optimal energy production year-round, it is advised that panels be installed at an ideal tilt angle of 41 degrees facing south for fixed panel installations (without considering tracking systems). Additionally, maintaining clean panels and incorporating proper drainage solutions may help prevent issues related to excessive precipitation or snow accumulation on the panels' surface.

Note: The Northern Temperate Zone extends from 35Â° latitude North up to 66.5Â° latitude.

So far, we have conducted calculations to evaluate the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in 481 locations across Germany. This analysis provides insights into each city/location's potential for harnessing solar energy through PV installations.

Solar output per kW of installed solar PV by season in Freiburg Im Breisgau

Seasonal solar PV output for Latitude: 48.0211, Longitude: 7.8177 (Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany), based on our analysis of 8760 hourly intervals of solar and meteorological data (one whole year) retrieved for that set of coordinates/location from NASA POWER (The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) API:

Ideally tilt fixed solar panels 41Â° South in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany

To maximize your solar PV system's energy output in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany (Lat/Long 48.0211, 7.8177) throughout the year, you should tilt your panels at an angle of 41Â° South for fixed panel installations.

As the Earth revolves around the Sun each year, the maximum angle of elevation of the Sun varies by +/- 23.45 degrees from its equinox elevation angle for a particular latitude. Finding the exact optimal angle to maximise solar PV production throughout the year can be challenging, but with careful consideration of historical solar energy and meteorological data for a certain location, it can be done precisely.

We use our own calculation, which incorporates NASA solar and meteorological data for the exact Lat/Long coordinates, to determine the ideal tilt angle of a solar panel that will yield maximum annual solar output. We calculate the optimal angle for each day of the year, taking into account its contribution to the yearly total PV potential at that specific location.

At Latitude: 48.0211, Longitude: 7.8177, the ideal angle to tilt panels is 41Â° South

Seasonally adjusted solar panel tilt angles for Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany

If you can adjust the tilt angle of your solar PV panels, please refer to the seasonal tilt angles below for optimal solar energy production in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany. As mentioned earlier, for fixed-panel solar PV installations, it is optimal to maintain a 41Â° South tilt angle throughout the year.

Overall Best Summer Angle Overall Best Autumn Angle Overall Best Winter Angle Overall Best Spring Angle 32Â° South in Summer 51Â° South in Autumn 61Â° South in Winter 40Â° South in Spring

Assuming you can modify the tilt angle of your solar PV panels throughout the year, you can optimize your solar generation in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany as follows: In Summer, set the angle of your panels to 32Â° facing South. In Autumn, tilt panels to 51Â° facing South for maximum generation. During Winter, adjust your solar panels to a 61Â° angle towards the South for optimal energy production. Lastly, in Spring, position your panels at a 40Â° angle facing South to capture the most solar energy in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany.

Our recommendations take into account more than just latitude and Earth's position in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. We also incorporate historical solar and meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) API to assign a weight to each ideal angle for each day based on its historical contribution to overall solar PV potential during a specific season.

This approach allows us to provide much more accurate recommendations than relying solely on latitude, as it considers unique weather conditions in different locations sharing the same latitude worldwide.

Calculate solar panel row spacing in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany

We've added a feature to calculate minimum solar panel row spacing by location. Enter your panel size and orientation below to get the minimum spacing in Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany.

Our calculation method

Solar Position:

We determine the Sun's position on the Winter solstice using the location's latitude and solar declination.

Shadow Projection:

We calculate the shadow length cast by panels using trigonometry, considering panel tilt and the Sun's elevation angle.

Minimum Spacing:

We add the shadow length to the horizontal space occupied by tilted panels.

This approach ensures maximum space efficiency while avoiding shading during critical times, as the Winter solstice represents the worst-case scenario for shadow length.

Topography for solar PV around Freiburg Im Breisgau, Germany

The topography around Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany is mostly hilly and mountainous. The highest peak in the area is the Schauinsland mountain at 1,284 meters (4,213 feet). The hills and mountains are dotted with small villages and rolling farmlands.

For large-scale solar PV installations in this area, areas that have relatively flat terrain would be most suitable. Areas such as the Rhine Valley to the north of Freiburg or the open plains to the east of Freiburg could be suitable locations for large-scale solar PV installations.

Germany solar PV Stats as a country

Germany ranks 4th in the world for cumulative solar PV capacity, with 58,461 total MW's of solar PV installed. This means that 9.70% of Germany's total energy as a country comes from solar PV (that's 3rd in the world). Each year Germany is generating 702 Watts from solar PV per capita (Germany ranks 3rd in the world for solar PV Watts generated per capita). [source]

Are there incentives for businesses to install solar in Germany?

Yes, there are a few incentives for businesses wanting to install solar energy in Germany. These include feed-in tariffs, which guarantee businesses a price per kilowatt hour of electricity produced from their solar system; tax incentives such as the reduction of corporate income taxes; and subsidies from regional governments or utilities. Additionally, Germany's Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) provides additional support for projects that involve renewable energies.
