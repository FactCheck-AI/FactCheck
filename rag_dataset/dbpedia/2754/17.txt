SAN ANTONIO – The Joker Wild Card is a new thrill ride set to open at Six Flags Fiesta Texas and it promises to be the tallest, fastest ride at the park.

A pendulum will swing a giant disk back and forth as it whirls thrill seekers up to 75 miles per hour.

The disc will whip riders a record-breaking 17 stories in the air, making the Joker Wild Card the tallest pendulum ride in the world.

“The Joker Wild Card will be the fastest ride in park history and is the perfect villainous twist to our already spectacular ride lineup in the newly themed DC Universe area,” said park president Jeffrey Siebert.

Guests will experience a feeling of weightlessness 172 feet in the air as the pendulum reaches its peak, according to a press release.

The new attraction is expected to open during summer 2019, park officials said.
