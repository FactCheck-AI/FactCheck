Lilongwe, which derives its name from the river that dissects the city from west to east, is the capital city of Malawi and has been the seat of government since 1975 following the move of the Capital from Zomba. Lilongwe has developed from a small settlement on the banks of the Lilongwe River to become Malawiâ€™s largest city with over 1 million residents. It is a cosmopolitan city with inhabitants from all over Malawi, Africa and the rest of the world who have made Lilongwe their home. In addition to being the centre of Government administration, Lilongwe is important for industry, distribution, services and trade. It is also the gateway to Malawi at the intersection of road, rail and air connections to the region.
