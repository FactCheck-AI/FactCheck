Lilongwe has developed from a small settlement on the banks of the Lilongwe River to become Malawiâ€™s largest city with over 1 million residents. It is a cosmopolitan city with inhabitants from all over Malawi, Africa and the rest of the world who have made Lilongwe their home. In addition to being the centre of Government administration, Lilongwe is important for industry, distribution, services and trade.
