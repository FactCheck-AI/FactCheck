"The Saint James parish, founded in 1833 originally served a mixed population of German and Irish immigrants. By 1841 the German population in the neighborhood had increased greatly and the Irish population center had shifted closer to the Jonestown area.

Therefore the Saint Vincent parish on Front Street was created out of the English-speaking segment of Saint James; Saint James was designated to serve the German-speaking population and was placed under the ministry of the Redemptionist order, under whose ministry it remains today.

By the early 1860s the number of parishioners had grown well beyond the capacity of the old church, and plans were made for construction of the present facility. The cornerstone was laid on October 22, 1865 and the building was dedicated on December 22, 1867. Through the years the church sponsored a large number of philanthropic services, social groups, cultural activities, and even a savings and loan association for the neighborhood.

Among the prominent business and civic leaders associated with Saint James were Louis Dohme, co-founder of the Sharp and Dohme pharmaceutical company (now Merck, Sharp, and Dohme), and brewers George Brehm and Thomas Beck. On the front wall of the church there are two plaques bearing the names of members of the church who served in both World Wars.

By the 1960s most of the Catholic German-Americans and Irish-Americans had moved out of the area and had been replaced by a mostly non-Catholic black population. In 1966, the nearby church of Saint John the Evangelist, a one-time major Irish parish founded in 1853, was forced to close because of dwindling numbers, and was merged into Saint James forming the present-day parish of St. James and Saint John's."

The church building is now (2021) the Urban Bible Fellowship Church.
