The Keisei Electric Railway, often shortened to Keisei or KDK, is a private railway company which operates from Tokyo to Chiba and Narita, in addition to various small suburbs around the east of Japan. The company has been branded as K'SEI since 2001.

The company's history dates back to 1909, when it was founded on 30 June that year; services began on 3 November 1912. The company is well known for operating the Skyliner airport rail link service that links Ueno with Narita International Airport which began in 1973 over the Keisei Narita Airport Line (branded the Narita Sky Access Line); the Skyliner service has a top speed of 160 km/h (100 mph), which makes Keisei the fastest private railway operator in the region.
