Synopsis

The battle of the sexes has seen no greater playing field than one of the strictest all-girls’ schools in Tehran, where formidable headmistress Mrs Darabi rules with an iron fist. Her number one, non-negotiable regulation: no man must ever cross the threshold of her institution of academic excellence. However, when a teacher must take leave just as the school’s star science students are preparing for the international Chemistry Olympiad, Mrs Darabi’s only option is to hire a dedicated, if bumbling, male teacher. Once her golden rule is broken, Mrs Darabi’s dislike of men reaches a fever pitch, with results that will have audiences rolling in the aisles – and cheering for good old-fashioned romance. ‘No Entry for Men’ was wildly successful at the box-office in its native Iran and for good reason – this charming, gentle romantic comedy will appeal to young and old alike.
