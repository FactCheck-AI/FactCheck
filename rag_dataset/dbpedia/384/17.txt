The Catalan architect Ricardo Bofill, born in 1939 in Barcelona, built remarkable buildings in the early 1960s.

He first works in the organic, abundant vein, attentive to the effects of materials that is that of the Barcelona school.

In 1963, he created the Taller de arquitectura, a multidisciplinary workshop that is well known for its formal inventiveness and its often emphatic sense of the spectacular.

Together with other Spanish intellectuals of the 1960s, he was part of the Divine Left.

Ricardo Bofill has more than five hundred projects to his credit in some fifty different countries.
