Through world-class musical presentations and ceremonies, The United States Air Force Band uses music to bridge cultural, linguistic and socioeconomic differences to advance international relationships and inspire positive and long-lasting impressions of the U.S. Air Force and the United States of America.

Born out of a nation about to enter the Second World War, The United States Air Force Band started as one of 59 “Air Force Bands” activated on October 1, 1941. The Band’s unsurpassed professionalism and proximity to the Headquarters for the Army Air Forces on Bolling Field in Washington, D.C. quickly earned it the designation as “The Official Band of the Army Air Forces.” The Band’s name officially changed to The United States Air Force Band with creation of the the U.S. Air Force in 1947.
