A comprehensive study of Victorian photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.

Renowned photographer Julia Margaret Cameron is famous for her evocative portraits of eminent Victorians, including John Herschel, Alfred Tennyson, Henry Taylor, George Frederic Watts, Ellen Terry, and Julia Stephen. This study of her work reveals how deeply she was convinced of the poetic possibilities of her medium, particularly its capacity for suggestive rather than literal meaning. Cameron’s practice violated the aesthetic orthodoxy of the day, and she did not always succeed in her artistic goals. But the blurring of the “real” subject before her lens created unparalleled possibilities for a broader pursuit of the sublime and beautiful.
