Pop star Kylie Minogue has signed a management deal with Jay-Z's music label Roc Nation.

The surprise announcement was made on the label's website on Tuesday night.

Based in New York, the company will give Minogue a permanent foothold in the US, where she has never managed to achieve sustained success.

US trade paper Billboard said a new single from the Australian singer was due "soon", after more than a year spent working on her 12th studio album.

Minogue parted company with British label EMI last year, after it was taken over by rival music company Universal.

The European Commission only approved the takeover on the condition that Universal sold Parlophone, which was also home to Blur and Lily Allen.

It is understood that Parlophone will continue to release Minogue's music, while Roc Nation will handle her management.

Although she has worked with several record labels over her 25-year career, this is the first time the star has changed her management, after amicably parting from fellow Australian Terry Blamey in January.

Roc Nation is also home to Rihanna, Rita Ora, MIA and Calvin Harris - and last week signed hip-hop producer Timbaland.

Minogue and Timbaland will appear on stage together at Roc Nation benefit concert this weekend, following the Grammy Awards.
