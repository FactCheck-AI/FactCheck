American-born musician and songwriter Roy St John travelled around the world with his parents before he had even heard of Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly. His family finally settled in Guildford, England where he attended school with John Renbourn and Phillip Goodhand-Tait, often touring folk clubs with the former. He returned to his hometown, St Louis, but missed England and came back to take up a career as a teacher and journalist while painting and performing with the River Bottom Band. Selling paintings to fund p.a. equipment he soon became part of the Pub Rock scene and signed with Virgin Records. His first album 'Immigration Declaration' sported notes by John Peel and got rave reviews. Years later Roy again returned to St Louis where the new tracks on this album were created, and where Roy and the Wranglers continue to perform at BBs Jazz Blues and Soups with bassist David Topretta and drummer Toren Jones. There they are often Wrangle augmented by pianists Danny Mills and Jim Brennan and percussionist Darren Crocker. All songs written by Roy St John. Mastering is by Bazza aka Barry Farmer and Stroud's own Andrew Butler at DB Studios. Bonus tracks include tracks recorded in the UK over the years. Videos of the songs can be viewed on youtube or at www.huskyalbum.com.
