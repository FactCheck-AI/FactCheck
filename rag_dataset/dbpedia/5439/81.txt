The fourth installment of the "Planet of the Apes" sci-fi movie series was the "Conquest". There were two major filming locations for this movie: UC Irvine and Century City. This is the UC Irvine location.

Filmed in 1972 and taking place in the futuristic date of 1991, a brand new UC Irvine campus was the perfect future city for the project.

The quad adjacent to the Social Science Tower was the location used as the site of the ape auction.
