An iconic Christmas album, released for the first time on “Ruby Red” vinyl with a new collectable cover.

The legendary Ella Fitzgerald sings (and swings) Jingle Bells; Sleigh Ride; Winter Wonderland; and more on this classic Christmas album! Ella puts her singular stamp on everything from a sultry vamp like "What Are You Doing New Year's Eve?" to the sweet and cozy "The Christmas Song." Even standards like "Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town" sound fresher when they're coming from Ella Fitzgerald!
