[Kieslowski and Piesiewicz] have the very rare ability to dramatise their ideas rather than just talking about them. They do this with such dazzling skill, you never see the ideas coming and don't realise until much later how profoundly they have reached your heart.

- Stanley Kubrick, foreword to Kieslowski & Piesiewicz: Decalogue: The Ten Commandments, 1991

If anyone could be considered a contemporary European master it wasÂ KieÅlowski and the Dekalog in particular remains one of the great saving graces of the European cinema over the last disappointing decade - From Derek Malcom'sÂ KieÅlowski obituary for The Guardian

The ICA is celebrating the 25th anniversary of Krzysztof KieÅlowski's 1989 masterpiece The Decalogue (Dekalog) with a rich and wide-ranging retrospective. The Decalogue is a renowned Polish television drama series directed by KieÅlowski and co-written with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, with music by Zbigniew Preisner. It consists of ten one-hour films, inspired by the Ten Commandments.

KieÅlowski's works are meditative, often melancholic in tone, expressionist in technique, and tackle themes of identity and what it means to be at once connected and isolated. The Decalogue is a work that reflects the instability and ongoing transformation of an individualâs life. It's an examination of the emotions upon which life itself is built: emotions which are the driving force behind all our decisions, choices, mistakes and sins.

This retrospective is not only a journey through The Decalogue series but also presents some of KieÅlowskiâs first documentaries and other pivotal yet lesser known films.
