Uttarakhand, often referred to as the "Land of the Gods" (Devbhumi), is a state in northern India known for its stunning natural beauty and significant religious heritage. Formerly known as Uttaranchal until 2007, this picturesque state is divided into two regions, Garhwal and Kumaon, encompassing a total of 13 districts.

Dehradun, the state's largest city, serves as its winter capital, while Bhararisain in the Chamoli district has been declared the summer capital. Nestled amidst the majestic Himalayas, Uttarakhand shares borders with Tibet to the north, Nepal to the east, Uttar Pradesh to the south, and Himachal Pradesh to the west and northwest. The state is renowned for its diverse landscapes, including the lush Terai region and the foothills of the Himalayas.

Uttarakhand's name has its roots in ancient Sanskrit, where "Uttara" means 'north' and "khaṇḍa" means 'section' or 'part', simply translating to 'Northern Part'. This region has a rich history dating back to prehistoric times, contrary to earlier beliefs of being barren. Stone Age settlements have been discovered in Kumaon and Garhwal, indicating early human habitation.

During the Vedic period, the area was part of the Uttarakuru Kingdom. Various dynasties, including the Kunindas and Katyuris, ruled different parts of Uttarakhand. During the medieval period, it was divided into the Kumaon Kingdom and the Garhwal Kingdom. Later, it fell under the control of the Gorkha Empire of Nepal and the British after the Anglo-Nepalese War. The Garhwal Kingdom was re-established as a princely state in 1816.

Post-independence, Uttarakhand was merged into Uttar Pradesh until demands for separate statehood led to its formation as India's 27th state on November 9, 2000. Uttarakhand is also famous for the Chipko movement of the 1970s, a significant environmental and social protest led by activists like Gaura Devi, Sunderlal Bahuguna, and Chandi Prasad Bhatt, which played a crucial role in shaping India's environmental consciousness.

Uttarakhand, nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, is known for its diverse and stunning landscape. Encompassing 53,566 square kilometres, the state is mostly mountainous, with lush forests covering 65% of its terrain. Towering peaks and ancient glaciers in the north give rise to sacred rivers like the Ganges and Yamuna, shaping the revered Chota Char Dham pilgrimage route, which includes Badrinath and Kedarnath.

Amidst this natural wonderland lie the Jim Corbett National Park, home to Bengal tigers, and the UNESCO World Heritage Sites of Nanda Devi and Valley of Flowers National Parks. Here, rare species like snow leopards, Himalayan black bears, langurs, orange-breasted green pigeons, jungle babblers, and chestnut-winged cuckoos thrive.

The state's landscape is also adorned with sal trees, rhododendrons, and silk cotton trees. At the same time, botanical treasures like Picrorhiza kurroa, Aconitum violaceum, and Podophyllum hexandrum further enrich the region's biodiversity, attracting nature lovers and conservationists.

Uttarakhand boasts a multiethnic population spread across its two geocultural regions: Garhwal and Kumaon. The native people, known as Uttarakhandi, are often categorised as Garhwali or Kumaoni based on their origin. According to the 2011 Census, the state's population is 10,086,292, with 69.77% residing in rural areas.

The population density is 189 people per square kilometre, with a growth rate of 18.81% from 2001 to 2011. The gender ratio is 963 females per 1000 males. Rajputs constitute about 35% of the population, while Brahmins make up approximately 20%. Other significant groups include Other Backward Classes (18.3%), Scheduled Castes (18.76%), and Scheduled Tribes (2.89%).

The Governor, appointed for a five-year term, is the formal head, while the Chief Minister, currently Pushkar Singh Dhami, wields executive powers. The state's legislative assembly has 70 MLAs, and elections are held for Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha representation. Politics is largely between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC).

Uttarakhand is divided into 13 districts under two divisions: Kumaon and Garhwal. Each district is managed by a district magistrate, with further subdivisions.

Garwhali Miniature painting flourished in the 17th to 19th century, with Mola Ram pioneering the Garhwali branch.

Aipan, a GI-certified Kumaoni ritual art, uses white rice flour paste on brick-red walls to invoke blessings during special ceremonies. The state's literature, in languages like Hindi, Garhwali, and Kumaoni, has birthed literary luminaries like Sumitranandan Pant and Ruskin Bond.

Uttarakhand's cuisine, characterised by its use of coarse grains like Buckwheat and Maduwa, offers delicacies like Bal Mithai and Dubuk, alongside unique dishes such as Bhatt and bhutwa. The region's dances, like Langvir Nritya and Barada Nati, reflect diverse human emotions, while folk music, played on instruments like Dhol and Damau, resonates with the soul of the land. Festivals like Kumbh Mela, Almora Dussehra, and Phool-Dei add colour and fervour to the cultural fabric, celebrating traditions and welcoming the changing seasons with joy and reverence.
