Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum

In the center of Samarkand, the beautiful dome of the Gur-e-Amir Mausoleum, which befits the name of the Blue City, is a mausoleum where the monarchs of the Timurid dynasty, who ruled Central Asia in the 15th century, are buried. The walls are decorated with geometric patterns in blue tones, the arches are decorated with intricate stalactite-like carvings called muqarnas, and the interior is richly decorated in blue and gold, all of which tell the story of the glory of the Timurid dynasty.

Samarkand

Samarkand developed as an oasis city from B.C. onward, and its prosperity as a Silk Road transit city can still be seen today. It is called the "Blue City" because of the vivid contrast between the blue tiles of Islamic architecture built between the late 14th and 15th centuries, when it was the capital of the Timurid dynasty, and the clear, blue sky. It is a regular part of the trip to visit the mausoleums and mosques, which are decorated with intricate patterns, and take the time to appreciate their stunning beauty.
