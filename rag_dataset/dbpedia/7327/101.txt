June 25, 2024

Mike Tirico leads a roster of more than 150 commentators for NBCUniversal’s coverage of the Olympic Games Paris 2024, scheduled for July 26-Aug. 11 across NBC, Peacock, USA Network, CNBC, E!, GOLF Channel, Telemundo, Universo, and NBCUniversal’s digital platforms.

The roster includes Olympians and Paralympians who have won a combined 90 Olympic medals.

A member of Team NBC has been part of Team USA in every Summer Games dating back to the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.

The lineup features the return of many of the network’s signature Olympic hosts, play-by-play commentators, and analysts with Olympic experience as well as talented new voices.
