The Randwick Clinical Campus, adjacent to the main campus at Kensington, is currently the centre of significant development which will see further integration between the two campuses. The campus incorporates the four teaching hospitals at Randwick: Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney Childrenâ€™s Hospital, the Royal Hospital for Women and Prince of Wales Private Hospital.

The campus is a key partner in the Randwick Health & Innovation Precinct, set to become the largest co-located health precinct in NSW. The precinct brings together four hospitals, UNSW and nine institutes spanning neuroscience, mental health, cancer and other fields.
