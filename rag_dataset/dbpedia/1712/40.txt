Jay-Z – The Dynasty: Roc La Familia (2000)

Released: 31 October 2000

On Halloween in the Year 2000, Jay-Z and Rocafella Records collaborated to create one of the illest group albums of all-time in The Dynasty: Roc La Familia.

Although Dynasty is jam-packed with features from acts such as Beanie Sigel and Memphis Bleek, Jay-Z leads the show by appearing on approximately 70% of the album’s songs.

Beanie Sigel notably made a name for himself on Dynasty, challenging Hov on records such as “Where Have You Been”, “Streets is Talkin”, and “Stick 2 the Script” for best verse. Overall, Dynasty has aged well as an LP, and is still a worthy listen over 20 years after its release!

★★★★–★★★★1/2: Excellent; recommended to all fans of artist or genre.
