I think that the people of the third installment of MK should dedicate the movie to Trevor Goddard (the guy who play Kano in the first movie).

That's if they hadn't already done the second movie in his name already.

This is a very cool idea, nice one.

Yes, Trevor played a great Kano in the first movie. I've always thought it was cool that they changed Kano in the game (for MKDA) based upon Trevor Goddard's excellent portrayal of him in the movie, I mean, that's just awesome.

Gregory Mckinney (Jax in the first movie) also died since MK came out, and Brandon Lee, who was supposedly cast as Johnny Cage, was killed before filming for MK began...

One word-YES!!!!!! He was one of the best(if not the best) actor in that movie. He potrayed Kano so well! I think it was because of him Kano became famous. When I first read that he died, I freaked out- I couldnt belive he was dead. So yes they definatly should dedicate Mortal Kombvat Devastation to Trevor Goddard.
