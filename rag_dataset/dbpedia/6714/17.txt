Fronius Tauro Eco 50Kw 50-3-P inverter designed to withstand direct solar radiation and extreme heat.

Lower costs and efficient service.- Minimum operating costs: the Fronius Tauro is quick to install and easy to maintain. In the event of a fault, it is enough to replace the affected power stage instead of the entire inverter. This ensures safe operation and enables maintenance work to be carried out quickly and cost-effectively.

Intelligent control and open system.- Like the rest of the Fronius products, the Fronius Tauro can be easily monitored, controlled and maintained using a smartphone or a computer. With Fronius Solar.web you can monitor your installation at all times. The system's open architecture allows easy integration of third-party components.

Maximum flexibility in system design with minimum operating costs: Thanks to the robust Fronius Tauro inverter, large PV systems can become even more profitable. Whether in direct sunlight or in extreme heat, its double-layer shell and active ventilation offer maximum performance even in the most adverse environmental conditions. In addition, installation and maintenance of this rugged project inverter is quick and easy.

Resistance and long useful life.- Designed to withstand direct solar radiation and extreme heat: its double-layer casing and active ventilation make the Fronius Tauro a durable and resistant inverter that offers maximum performance.

Design flexibility.- Centralized, decentralized, vertical or horizontal: the Fronius Tauro series offers maximum flexibility in the design and installation of large photovoltaic installations. The flexibility of the Taurus and the profitability of the Taurus ECO can be combined as needed. Built-in surge protection and AC Daisy Chaining reduce the need for additional components and wiring.

Repair and sustainability.- The Fronius Tauro demonstrates the importance of sustainability in each phase of the product cycle. This project inverter is designed for a long service life and has been designed and produced in Austria with as few interchangeable components as possible. This makes the Tauro a particularly resistant device that, in case of needing maintenance, it is enough to change the individual parts on site, saving time and resources.

The Fronius Tauro is available in two versions:

Fronius Taurus | 50 kW | 3 MPP trackers

Fronius Taurus ECO | 50 and 100 kW | 1 MPP tracker

​Demonstrable efficiency.- Its efficiency speaks for itself: the Fronius Tauro impresses by constantly offering maximum performance at temperatures of up to 50 °C.

Applications and features of the Fronius Tauro ECO 50kW Grid Inverter

The Taurus inverter from the Fronius International factory has multiple benefits described:

Developed for external areas that are not protected. Optimal for assembly in unprotected environments. Due to its excellent active cooling technology and the double casing layer, the Fronius Tauro ECO inverter can be mounted in full sunlight.

Save BOS Costs. AC connectivity decreases the number of AC combiner boxes and cabling, leading to a reduction in BOS costs and mounting equipment on the ground or on the roof.

Maximum performance. The inverter cooling and the double layer offers, in addition to high performance, the safety of elements at high temperatures, allowing a longer useful life of the converter and all its elements.

System adaptability and assembly. Raised connection areas provide the ability to have different elements without having to use additional boxes. Fronius Tauro provides multiple options: it can be mounted vertically and horizontally, and have centralized and decentralized designs.

Integrated monitoring. The Fronius Tauro inverter comes from the factory with the software and hardware to be able to monitor the equipment. Other elements can be added due to the open interfaces of the converter.

Simple and fast service. With the contribution of advanced technology, the Fronius Tauro can be controlled in the same place by only one person, saving labor and time costs.
