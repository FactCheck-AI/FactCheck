Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California. Formed in 1979, the band initially played under the names Sharp Young Men, then Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist Roddy Bottum and drummer Mike Bordin are the only long-term band members involved since the creation of Faith No More. The group faces several training changes over the years. The band's current lineup includes Gould, Bottum, Bordin, guitarist Jon Hudson, and singer Mike Patton.

After six albums, Faith No More officially announces her separation on April 20, 1998. They reform afterwards and embark on a tour The Second Coming Tour between 2009 and 2012, and publish a seventh album, Sol Invictus, in May 2015.

Their musical style combines various elements: heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive rock, soul, hip-hop and jazz. Faith No More dissolved in 1998 but reformed in 2009.

Faith No More started as a band when Billy Gould, Mike Bordin, and Roddy Bottum started playing together. Following Cliff Burton's recommendation, Jim Martin is added to the training. He later admitted that the group's name came from a dog they had bet on. The group also frequently changes singers, and Courtney Love, who is a good friend of Roddy Bottum, sings very briefly with the band.
