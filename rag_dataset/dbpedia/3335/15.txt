Heartland's exciting youngster Stanley Okoro is top of a list of 21 players picked by Nigeria coach John Obuh for the FIFA Under-17 World Cup, which kicks off on October 24 at the Abuja National Stadium.

Okoro has been in superb form for Heartland in this year's CAF Champions League and he has also been among the goals as the country's schoolboy team prepared in Qatar for the Under-17 World Cup.

Nigeria will therefore be counting on him for goals and inspiration as the Golden Eaglets defend on home soil the World Cup they won in Korea two years ago.
