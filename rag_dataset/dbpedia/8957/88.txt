Background

The Kingdom of Yemen (colloquially known as North Yemen) became independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918 and in 1962 became the Yemen Arab Republic. The British withdrew in 1967 from what became the People's Republic of Southern Yemen (colloquially known as South Yemen). The two countries were formally unified as the Republic of Yemen in 1990.
