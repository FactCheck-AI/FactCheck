Description

Description

Welcome to this fantastic holiday home where the whole family can enjoy the holidays. You travel here if you really want to experience the ultimate summer holiday with lots of swimming and nature experiences, or a wonderful winter holiday with the family where you can enjoy your time in front of the fireplace with a view of the sea.

The accommodation is divided into 3 bedrooms, one of which is on the first floor with two single beds, the other two bedrooms are on the second floor with a bunk bed in one and a double bed in the other. A well-equipped kitchen, toilet and a large family room with a stove are on the lower floor. The house also has a built-in veranda for lovely dinners with a view of the sea. On the plot there is also an annex with a family bed for three people.

It also belongs to a large nice garden with only a short distance of about 70 m down to the sea for swimming or fishing.

There is also a public bathing area just 200 m from the house with a sandy beach and jetty.

It is possible to bring your own boat, contact us to arrange a boat berth.

In and around Ronneby there are numerous experiences to choose from for both young and old. Large, beautiful forests for those who like nature and why not a visit to Ronneby Brunnspark, which offers a fantastic natural environment with a garden feel and beautiful hiking trails.

Café Mandeltårtan is recommended for a pleasant coffee experience and Björketorps Gård, which produces its own ice cream of the highest class, is very much appreciated by both children and adults.

For those interested in golf, we can recommend Ronneby GK, but there are also other golf courses within reasonable driving distance.

For those interested in shopping, there are both street shops and a mall in Ronneby, which is only 8 km from the property.
