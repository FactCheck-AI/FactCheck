A Little Princess captured the hearts of many, with child star Liesel Matthews stealing the show as young Sara Crewe.

Back in 1995, the nine-year-old actress starred as the adorable little girl in Alfonso Cuaron 's World War 1 drama loosely based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's novel of the same name.

Although the film suffered from a lack of promotion from Warner Brothers - leading to a poor showing at the box office - the movie became a favourite with fans and critics, even getting nominated for two Academy Awards.

The star - whose real name is Liesel Pritzker - went on to appear in Air Force One (1997) and Blast (2000), before calling time on her acting career.

Now, the Hyatt Hotels heiress has moved on with her life and looks to use her fortune to help those less fortune around the world.

After suing her family over a trust fund, she and her brother won $280 million from the case - and it's been put to good use.

Liesel - now married and living in New York City - invests in countries who are in need of aid, such as Ghana or Kenya.

She is also now director of the IDP Foundation, which was founded by her mother - and has made it clear that she will use her wealth to make a positive impact.

In a previous interview with Forbes in 2013, she said: "I didn't earn this money and I'll be damned if I'm going to screw it up."
