Wagon Master | 1950

Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr help Ward Bond guide a Mormon wagon train through Utah, in the movie that gave rise to the TV series Wagon Train, which starred longtime John Ford regular Bond.

Wagon Master uses the landscapes around around Moab, Utah, including Hittle Bottom on the Colorado River at Professor Valley, about 20 miles northeast of Moab, and Spanish Valley, to the southeast.
