Peruvian Congressman Kenji Fujimori, the son of former President Alberto Fujimori, has been expelled from the opposition Fuerza Popular (Popular Force) party by his sister, Keiko.

Keiko Fujimori, who leads the party, and Kenji clashed over an impeachment vote against current President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.

Kenji Fujimori broke party ranks to vote against impeaching the president.

His vote was key to Mr Kuczynski surviving the impeachment move.
