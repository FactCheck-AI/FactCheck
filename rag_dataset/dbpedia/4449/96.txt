Description

Object description

Original wartime caption: First official photographs of the Avro York, civil transport version of the famous Avro Lancaster bomber. Externally, the main points of difference between the York and the Lancaster are the shape of the fuselage [which has been specially designed for passenger or freight carrying] and the introduction of a triple-fin tail unit in the former. In each aircraft the design of the individual fin and rudder is similar, and the wings and engine nacelles of the York were designed originally for the Lancaster. The York's wing span is 102 ft. and its overall length 78 ft. It is powered by four Rolls-Royce liquid-cooled Merlin engines. When employed over comparatively short distances it is capable of carrying more than 50 passengers, but it may be used for either short or long journeys, and can be adapted readily to take passengers and freight, or freight alone. Picture (issued 1943) shows - The Avro York.
