Now that the two movies are out, we have a better idea of Villeneuve's approach to his adaptation, so its an almost certainty that alot of elements wont make it in the movie for a more focused story.

(I'm pretty sure the main focus caracteres will be Paul, Alia, Irulan, Chani and Scytale, perhaps Hayt).
