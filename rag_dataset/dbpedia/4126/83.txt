Despite the coronavirus pandemic, the 47th annual Daytime Emmy Awards will be awarded this year — but in a fashion unlike any other.

The National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS) announced Wednesday that it had decided to do away with traditional ceremonies for Daytime, Sports, and News & Documentary television programming, as well as achievement in television Technology & Engineering, opting instead to celebrate via remote video productions for the remainder of the 2019-2020 awards season.

“While it appears unlikely that officials would even permit these large-crowd events to be held this year, it is also clear that there will be a lag of time between being permitted to have an event and being able to provide an environment in which all attendees feel safe and comfortable attending it,” NATAS President & CEO Adam Sharp said in a statement. “Ultimately, a single person-to-person transmission resulting in serious infection would be devastating evidence of mistaken judgment in proceeding.”

The announcement comes after several earlier changes to the NATAS awards schedule, including indefinite postponements of in-person awards ceremonies. Now, those postponements are being replaced with a series of productions later this year that will employ multiple remote video production technologies in order to involve both nominees and presenters.

NATAS has yet to set new celebration dates for its remote productions, suggesting that more information will be available after the Daytime Emmy nominees are announced next month and the News & Documentary are announced this summer.

Viewers interested in tuning in to see their favorite daytime stars accepting awards from their couches will be able to tune in on all leading “Smart TV” platforms via the Academy’s forthcoming apps, as well as through other distribution partners.
