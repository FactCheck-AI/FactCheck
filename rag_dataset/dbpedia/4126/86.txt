Time to pop some bubbly, because the Daytime Emmys are back, baby! And the ceremonies will once again be taking place in person!

A source confirms to Soap Central that the 49th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards will be taking place on Friday, June 24, at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. As Soap Central previously reported, the star-studded event is slated to air at 8PM PST on CBS and stream live on Paramount+ at the same time. An official announcement from CBS has yet to be made.

Meanwhile, the Daytime Lifestyle Awards (which include the digital drama -- now dubbed "Daytime Fiction" -- categories) will take place prior to the main ceremony on Saturday, June 18, also at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium.

This is the first time since 2019 that the Daytime Emmy Awards will be taking place in person, having gone virtual in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Nominees for the 49th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards will be announced on May 3.
