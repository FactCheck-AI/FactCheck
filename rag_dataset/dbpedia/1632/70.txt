Complete running Alexander 948 BMC

This engine and transmission was in my Lotus 11. I am changing to a Coventry climax engine. If you are restoring a 950 turner, or other vintage race car, this is a great chance for you to have a cross flow BMC in your racecar.

Coventry Climax FPF MK1 #FPF 430/3/1203

Used in Jack Brabham's Cooper T43 at the 1957 German Grand Prix, in chassis F2-7-57 see Nye "Cooper Cars" page 147, 332, and 348 (should read F2-7-57, as its a typo.) Serial number FPF 430/3/1023

Ford GT40 Mk1

“If you aspire to win the Spa Six Hours!” Sister car to 3x Pole sitter and overall winner FIA HTP

1967 Bud Moore Engineering Mercury Cougar Trans-Am car.

All 1960s era Trans-Am cars were converted production cars, making the series extremely popular. BME ran the factory Cougar team; none of the cars have survived. This car is a replica and has no race history.
