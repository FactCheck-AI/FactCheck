<strong>Lotus</strong> <strong>18</strong> FIA Formula 1-car John Surtees at the <strong>1960</strong> British GP Technical Specifications (<strong>1960</strong>) In 1959 - by which time the Coventry Climax engines had been stretched to 2.5liters - Colin Chapman continued with a front-engined F1 car but the car achieved little and so in <strong>1960</strong> Chapman switched to rear-engined cars with the <strong>Lotus</strong> <strong>18</strong>. The Type <strong>18</strong> had a lower frontal area and carried the fuel nearer to the centre of gravity. It also featured an all-new suspension. The first <strong>Lotus</strong> victory came at Monaco that year when Stirling Moss beat the dominant Ferrari team in his Rob Walker <strong>Lotus</strong>. The first Team <strong>Lotus</strong> victory was in 1961 when Innes Ireland won the US GP. The <strong>Lotus</strong> <strong>18</strong> was also successful in Formula 2 and Formula Junior and over 120 Formula Junior type <strong>18</strong> were built during <strong>1960</strong>.
