1960 Lotus-Climax Formula One, 1500 cc Coventry Climax FPF. This car was built for the 1960 racing season when it was powered by the 240bhp Coventry Climax FPF engine. During the winter of 1960 it was rebuilt and updated to comply with the new 1.5 litre formula.

Today it still uses an original FPF unit. Stirling Moss drove the car once in 1961.
