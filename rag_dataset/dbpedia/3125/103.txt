Ice T, Noreaga and Cypress Hill’s B-Real and Sen Dog are among the Hip-Hop artists lending their voices to Vivendi Games’ new video game Scarface: The World Is Yours.

The game, which is distributed through Vivendi’s Sierra Entertainment, is based on Brian DePalma’s classic 1983 movie of the same name and takes place in 1980’s Miami.

The objective is to rebuild Tony Montana’s drug empire while fending off enemies.

The cast includes James Woods ( Casino ); Robert Davi ( Die Hard ); Michael Rapaport ( Beautiful Girls, The War at Home ), Anthony Anderson ( Hustle & Flow ); Richard Roundtree ( Shaft ); Tiny Lister ( Next Friday ); Bam Margera ( Viva La Bam ); Tommy Lee and others.

Al Pacino lends his image likeness to the lead role in the game and key lines from Pacino’s performance in the original film appear in the game.

“ Scarface is a brand universally recognized for its cutting-edge cool, even two decades after the movie’s original release. It’s no surprise that so many of the top talent from film, television and music would want to be a part of that world,” said Vivendi marketing executive Cindy Cook. “The video game is allowing people to be part of one of the most popular franchises in Hollywood.”
