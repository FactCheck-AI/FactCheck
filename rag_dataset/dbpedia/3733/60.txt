Saudi Arabia’s state news agency has announced the launch of its first news training academy. This significant development was revealed during the Human Capacity Development Initiative conference in Riyadh, a prestigious event held under the patronage of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The Saudi Press Agency (SPA) unveiled plans for the initial phase of the academy’s operations, highlighting key partnerships forged with both local and international entities. Among the domestic collaborators are the Technical and Vocational Training Corporation, the Prince Mohammad bin Salman College of Business and Entrepreneurship, the Institute of Public Administration, the Human Resources Development Fund, the Sky News Arabia Academy, and the Austrian International Centre for Qualification and Quality.

Benefiting from alliances with over 30 esteemed international news corporations, SPA’s pioneering academy aims to localise knowledge, share best practices, and emerge as a pivotal regional hub for news content production and dissemination.

With a clear mission to cultivate advanced news skills, address market demands, and facilitate the exchange of knowledge, technology, and modern journalistic tools, the academy endeavours to foster a comprehensive understanding of global news issues and challenges. Its diverse training programmes span five core domains: journalism and news, technology and artificial intelligence, leadership and journalism ethics, media partnerships, and news literacy.

Designed to cater to journalists, photographers, media professionals, technicians, media students, and officials involved in media affairs across various sectors, the academy’s initiatives mark a significant leap forward in enhancing the capabilities and standards of news reporting and dissemination in Saudi Arabia and beyond.
