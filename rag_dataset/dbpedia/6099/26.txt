Tommy Davidson, an actor, stand-up comedian, musician, and singer, started out performing stand-up in local talent showcases where he was spotted by concert promoters who booked him as the opening act for such major music stars as Patti LaBelle, Kenny G, and Luther Vandross. In Hollywood, he performed at the Comedy Act Theatre where he met Robert Townsend and Keenen Ivory Wayans, who would later prove instrumental in Davidson's career.

Davidson's first national television appearance was a starring role in Townsend's Partner's In Crime. Wayans then offered him the opportunity to audition for the primetime variety show In Living Color, and Davidson became one of the original cast members. His impressions of Sammy Davis, Jr., Michael Jackson, and others have become infamous.

In Living Color led to three Showtime specials and a handsome film career, including a reunion with fellow In Living Color alumni Jim Carrey in Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls. His film debut was opposite Halle Berry in Strictly Business, and he starred with Jada Pinkett Smith in New Line's romantic comedy Woo.
