Tommy Davidson is best known as one of the original cast members of the sketch comedy "In Living Color," but he has been a steady appearance on TV, in movies and on the standup circuit for decades.

His latest effort is a selection of jazz songs, collaborations with renowned performers in the genre including saxophonist Richard Elliot and multi-Grammy winner Dave Koz.

Davidson brings that variety of talent to a two-night, four-show engagement at Raleigh's Charlie Goodnight's comedy club July 21 and 22.
