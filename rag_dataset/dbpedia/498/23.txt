Hailing from Cincinnati, OH, WALK THE MOON consists of Nicholas Petricca (singer/keyboardist), Kevin Ray (bassist), Eli Maiman (guitarist), and Sean Waugaman (drummer). In 2015, the band catapulted to stardom when their hit single “Shut Up and Dance”, which is included on their RIAA Certified Gold album TALKING IS HARD, became a multi-platinum global smash that peaked at No. 1 on the Alternative, Hot AC, AC charts, No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and went to No. 2 at Top 40 radio. Throughout their career, the band has had a slew of honors including winning two Billboard Music Awards, a nomination for an MTV Music Video Award for Best Rock Video, American Music Award nominations for Favorite Pop/Rock Duo Or Group, New Artist of the Year, and Favorite Alternative Rock Artist. They were also nominated for an iHeart Radio Music Award for Best Duo/Group of the Year, Song of the Year, and Alternative Rock Song of the Year for “Shut Up and Dance.” After two years of performing countless sold out shows in twenty five countries across five continents, the band returned to the studio to craft their third major label release, 2017’s What If Nothing. The album showed the band simultaneously at their most epic and their most vulnerable, a daring step forward both musically and lyrically. The lead single, "One Foot," became a number one hit at Alternative Radio in 2018 and was among the most played alt songs of the year. WALK THE MOON returned in 2019 with their single, "Timebomb," a dancey, euphoric track featuring spanky guitars and an unforgettable sing-a-long chorus.
