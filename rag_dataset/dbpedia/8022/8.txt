Triazine is the chemical species of six-membered heterocyclic ring compound with three nitrogens replacing carbon-hydrogen units in the benzene ring structure. The names of the three isomers indicate which of the carbonhydrogen units on the benzene ring position of the molecule have been replaced by nitrogens, called 1,2,3-triazine, 1,2,4-triazine, and 1,3,5-triazine respectively. Symmetrical 1, 3, 5-triazine is the common. Triazines are prepared from cyanic acid amide by trimerization (1, 3, 5-triazine). Pyridine is the aromatic nitrogen heterocyclic compound having only one nitrogen, and diazines are with 2 nitrogen atoms, triazine having three nitrogen and tetrazines are with 4 nitrogen atoms on the benzene ring system. Triazines are weak base. Triazines have much weaker resonance energy than benzene, so nucleophilic substitution is preferred than electrophilic substitution. Heterocyclic bearing a symmetrical s-triazines or 1, 3, 5-triazines moieties, represent an interesting class of compounds possessing a wide spectrum of biological activities such as anti-cancer, antiviral, fungicidal, insecticidal, bactericidal, herbicidal and antimicrobial, antimalarial agents. They also find applications as dyes, lubricants and analytical reagents.
