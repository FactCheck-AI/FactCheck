Application

1,3,5-Triazine is a useful replacement for HCN in the Gattermann reaction for the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes. It reacts with nucleophiles, e.g. amines, which is utilized in quinazoline synthesis.

Preparation

Symmetrical 1,3,5-triazines are prepared by trimerization of certain nitriles such as cyanogen chloride or cyanimide. Benzoguanamine (with one phenyl and 2 amino substituents) is synthesised from benzonitrile and dicyandiamide. In the Pinner triazine synthesis (named after Adolf Pinner) the reactants are an alkyl or aryl amidine and phosgene. Insertion of an N-H moiety into a hydrazide by a copper carbenoid, followed by treatment with ammonium chloride also gives the triazine core.

Amine-substituted triazines called Guanamines are prepared by the condensation of cyanoguanidine with the corresponding nitrile:

(H2N)2C=NCN + RCN â†’ (CNH2)2(CR)N3
