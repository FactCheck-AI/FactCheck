Age 95, of Phoenix, AZ, originally from Pittsburgh, PA, fell asleep in the Lord on Wednesday, January 3, 2024.

Born August 20, 1928, Rose was preceded in death by her parents Carmine and Theresa Gaita, sister Carmella, three brothers Vince, Pellegrino (Pat) and John, her loving husband Jim and son-in-law Darrell.

Left to cherish her memory are daughter Rosanne of Sun City, AZ and son Jim (Faith) of Palmetto, FL; grandsons Michael and Jason of Pittsburgh, PA; Jason Ratliff of Archdale, NC; and two great-grandchildren Robert and Irene Ratliff of Archdale, NC.

Rose loved her family. Cooking for the whole clan was her favorite. She thrived in the kitchen, as it truly was her happy place. Being the “matriarch” of the family, she took care of everyone and always put herself second. Family was always first. As a member of St. George Church in Pittsburgh, PA, you could always find her in the kitchen whenever there was an event.

Friends will be received at the John F. Slater Funeral Home, Inc., 412-881-4100, 4201 Brownsville Road, Brentwood 15227, Sunday, January 14, 2024, 1:00-5:00 p.m., where a Funeral Service will be held on Monday at 10:00 a.m., followed by burial at Mt. Lebanon Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers, the family is requesting donations be made in memory of Rose Abraham to St. Marks Orthodox Church Building Fund, P.O. Box 1315, Bradenton, FL 34206 or Americare Hospice Foundation - 1212 N. Spencer St, Suite 2, Mesa, AZ 85203.
