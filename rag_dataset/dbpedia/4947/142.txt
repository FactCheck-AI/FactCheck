The Junior All Whites coach Chris Milicich has named his 20-man squad for next month's FIFA Under-20 World Cup qualifiers in Auckland.

Among the squad drawn from leagues in eight different countries, Milicich has selected two players - Birmingham City's Luke Rowe and Melbourne Victory's Marco Rojas - who were also included in Ricki Herbert's wider All Whites squad. Rojas made his international debut against China last week.

A total of eight players have been drawn from professional clubs including Italy-based right back Luke Graham, Germany-based goalkeeper Stefan Marinovich and Wellington Phoenix defender James Musa, while another two players have been selected from US universities.

The balance is largely made up of ASB Premiership regulars including golden boot runner-up Andy Bevin.

Established All White Chris Wood will stay with Brighton as the table-topping League One club, where the striker is on loan, chase promotion to the English Championship.

New Zealand have been drawn with the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia in group B of the seven-nation OFC U-20 Championships, with the winner of the April 29th final qualifying for the 2011 FIFA U-20 Championships in Colombia in July and August.
