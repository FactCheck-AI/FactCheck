#Bonus "HALF LIFE" at least I THINK it's a zombie game. There can't be more than 10 Polls, so if you think this ought to come in, feel free to comment. I don't know much about this game, but I do know it well from "Garry's Mod." If there's any zombie games I missed, I think I got everything, but if I didn't, feel free to share your thoughts!

Trigger Warning for some die-hard fans.

The Last of Us - A dramatic, heartwarming story about a fatherly bond between a survivor and a young girl, while on an important escort to find what she most seeks. A Playstation cult classic in the PS3-PS4 era. Makes you not want mushrooms on your pizza, cause then your paranoid thinking they'd make clicking noises...

Last of Us for me as I donâ€™t have an attachment to the others except TWD - and while I enjoy the games (currently first playthrough) I think it should be show or comics as the main source.

Probably because they is no monetary gain from it, I would assume

The Evil Within - Same as Poll 6, not technically a zombie game, but they still make me think "ZOMBIES." Although, completely different from Dead Space. Basically if RE and Silent Hill had a beautiful child named "The Evil Within".

Stefano Valentini with Obscura would be a great killer. Stefano could use a shorter speed attack like Wesker, whilst unleashing Obscura could be quite terrifying, especially with it having a flash attack that could even slow survivors ridiculously.

To be honest, a few of these titles I'd be happy with, namely: Evil Within, The Walking Dead (TV series though), Dead Space, Left 4 Dead (chapter 2, since Biiiillll's here!) and The Evil Dead franchise.
