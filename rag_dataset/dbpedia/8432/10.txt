A Cedar Rapids woman was arrested early Monday after allegedly drinking at two Iowa City bars after work and getting behind the wheel.

Police say they stopped 27-year-old Ashlee Gosse of 26th Street Southwest at the intersection of South Clinton and East Benton Street at 1:47am after she reportedly stopped past the solid painted line. Upon contact, Gosse allegedly had bloodshot watery eyes, thick slurred speech, and smelled strongly of ingested alcohol.

Gosse reportedly told officers that she had been drinking after work at Big Grove Brewery. When officers pointed out that she was actually headed from downtown, Gosse then said that she had also been drinking at the Club Car.

Gosse agreed to SFSTâs, which showed signs of impairment. A PBT showed a blood-alcohol level of .163, and a subsequent Datamaster test allegedly registered a .154.

Gosse had a previous OWI from Linn County in July of 2014. She was charged with her second, an aggravated misdemeanor punishable by a prison sentence of up to two years.
