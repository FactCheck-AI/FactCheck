Notes: with photographerÂ´s credit stamp "Fotografia Artistica. Crupi. Taormina" on the verso. Giovanni Crupi first considered photography as a hobby and only became a professional photographer in 1885. He was the friend and colleague of Wilhelm von Gloeden ; in the production of landscape images, the two have influenced each other to the point that the attribution of the works is often confused. It is probably due to the influence of Gloeden that Crupi made a small number of male nudes on the archaeological site of Syracuse . When Crupi left Italy, some of the negatives of landscapes and art monuments were bought by Gloeden who marketed them under his name. Today identical copies bear the signature of Crupi and Gloeden, but Crupi's photographs often stand out, even if they are signed Gloeden, by the presence of a thick black band at the bottom, in which is written the title of the image and the catalog number. This strip is missing in the photographs taken by Gloeden. In 1899 Crupi emigrated and opened a photographic workshop in Egypt near Cairo , Heliopolis 1 . He returned to Italy in 1910 and helped a parent who took over his business. without ever making a new photograph. (source: Wikipedia)
