About

Kathleen Hanna, lead singer of punk band Bikini Kill and dance-punk trio Le Tigre, was a pivotal figure in the riot grrrl movement of the 1990s. Through the use of extensive archival footage as well as intimate interviews, The Punk Singer recounts Hanna’s ascension into the forefront of musical and cultural awareness, her role as a feminist activist for a new generation of women, and her sudden retreat from public limelight. Among the many interviewed in the film are Joan Jett, Le Tigre’s Johanna Fateman and JD Samson, Sonic Youth’s Kim Gordon, Sleater-Kinney’s Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein, and Hanna’s husband (and Beastie Boy) Adam Horovitz.
