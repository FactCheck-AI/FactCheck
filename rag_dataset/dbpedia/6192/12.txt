Tangren Consulting specializes in providing tailored market research and strategic consulting solutions to clients seeking to navigate the Chinese market. Through analyzing consumer and technology trends, they offer practical marketing strategies, delivering unique plans for sustainable growth.

My objective while designing the visual identity for Tangren was to embody the company's pragmatic approach through a modern, minimalist design. The incorporation of Chinese characters in the logo, meaning 'consulting', serves to underscore the firmâs cultural connection and overarching purpose.
