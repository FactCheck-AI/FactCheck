Taking the opportunity to explore yet another magnificent London livery hall we may not have used for some time (if ever), World Traders recently met to attend the Company’s annual Common Hall.

Meeting in the Court Room of the Worshipful Company of Pewterers, Liverymen received the Accounts, voted on nominations for Court Assistant vacancies, and received updates from the Master, as well as Committee Chairs (or their representatives) on activities in their respective areas.

Having done the heavy lifting, members and their guests then repaired to the Hall’s splendid Livery Room for a delicious meal and refreshments. Huge thanks to Jon Perkins (JP), the Company’s Beadle and the rest of the team at Pewterers’ for a wonderful evening, including a last minute request for a screen and connection!
