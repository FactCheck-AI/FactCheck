How to choose a character

The first step to join Operation Big Snatch is to choose a character. You can choose from five characters, each with their own personality and style. They are:

TONY “BULLET IN THE TEETH”: A brutal bounty hunter who survived being shot six times and turned the bullets into gold teeth.

TURKISH: A trickster who organizes fist fights, runs an arcade, and has a funny name for an Englishman.

TOMMY: A lover of motorhomes and dogs who always ends up in the right place at the wrong time, or vice versa.

FRANKIE “FOUR FINGERS”: A professional gangster and a diamond lover who likes to gamble and lost a finger over a debt dispute.

BORIS “RAZOR” YURINOV: A ruthless arms dealer who used to be a secret agent and has many nicknames, all of them threatening.

You can select a character until January 24, 06:30 (GMT+3). After this, you will have one more day to complete the tasks. But choose carefully, because you cannot change your choice later. The tasks and conditions of the rating table correspond to the character’s character, so pick the one that suits your playstyle best.

How to complete the tasks

Once you choose a character, you will receive a chain of special combat missions. These missions are designed to match the character’s personality and style. For example, Tony’s missions involve dealing damage and destroying enemy vehicles, while Turkish’s missions involve spotting and assisting allies.

By completing the tasks, you will earn the Daisy Inspection item. This item will allow you to claim a random reward once a day. To claim your reward, go to the Events tab in the in-game Store and use the Daisy Inspection item. You can get various rewards, such as credits, gold, consumables, equipment, and more.

How to join the leaderboard

If you want to get even more rewards, you can join the leaderboard. The leaderboard is a competition among the players who have chosen the same character. By completing tasks, you will earn points and rank higher on the leaderboard. The higher you rank, the better rewards you will get.

To join the leaderboard, you need to select a character and press a special button. You can do this until January 24, 06:30 (GMT+3). After this, you will have one more day to complete the tasks and earn points. The final results will be published on January 26 at 16:00 (GMT+3). The rewards will be awarded no later than February 2.

Each character has their own leaderboard, so you will only compete with the players who have chosen the same character as you. The leaderboard is updated every hour, so you can check your progress and see how you compare with other players.
