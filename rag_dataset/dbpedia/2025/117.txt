About[]

Sallah Mohammed Faisel el-Kahir is a main character in three of the five Indiana Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny.

Sallah is a hefty, bearded Egyptian excavator. He lives in Cairo and is a close friend of Indiana Jones. He is a dedicated family man with a wife named Fayah and nine children, all of whom seem to have a fondness for Indy (at one point, they all surround him to save him from a group of Nazis who have their guns drawn on him).
