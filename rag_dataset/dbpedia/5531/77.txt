MOTIVATION

Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, one of the great contemporary masters of the French historical school, inspired to the lines of innovative research suggested by the famous magazine “Annales d’historie economique et sociale”, has given to numberless readers the pleasure of knowing the meaning of the past in the detailed texture of daily events.

In his works, and especially in “Le Paysans de Languedoc” and “Montaillou, village occitan”, men and women of the rural communities rediscover the value and the dignity of being protagonists.

The prize is delivered by Ulderico Bernardi.
