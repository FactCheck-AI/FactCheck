An impressive building that blends British and Mughal design is the Victoria Memorial.

A museum that includes a sizable collection of artefacts and exhibits from the British era in India is located inside the Victoria Memorial.

The expansive grounds that surround the Victoria Memorial are a favourite destination for tourists.

The Queen Victoria bronze statue, which is located at the monument's entryway, is one of the Victoria Memorial's many stunning sculptures.

It is a stunning White Marble structure whose construction started in 1906 and was finished in 1921. Although it was once intended to be a memorial to Britain's Queen Victoria, it has since changed into a museum that draws lots of visitors due to its beautiful architecture and exhibits.

The architectural style of the artistic monument combines Mughal and British elements. A museum with 25 galleries that features sculptures, pictures of historical figures, armour, and weapons is located inside the enormous stronghold. It also includes original and distinctive compositions by Omar Khayyam, William Shakespeare, and the author of Arabian Nights.

A large sum of money at the time, 10 million rupees, was spent on the construction of the Victoria Memorial.

White Makrana marble, the same kind of marble used to build the Taj Mahal, was utilised to build the memorial.

The memorial is 228 feet (69.5 metres) in width by 338 feet (103 metres) in length. It stands 184 feet (56 metres) tall and has a sizable dome in the middle.

More than 28,000 artefacts, including paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, and other items relating to the history of Kolkata and India during the British colonial era, are on display in the museum that is housed in the memorial.

The 64 acres (26 hectares) of grounds around the memorial are a well-liked location for gatherings and other recreational activities.

British sculptor George Frampton produced the bronze figure of Queen Victoria that stands at the memorial's entryway.

A music and light performance that tells the history of the memorial and the city of Kolkata is also present at the memorial.

The Prince of Wales, who would later become King Edward VIII, unveiled the Victoria Memorial in 1921.
