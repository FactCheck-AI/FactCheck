Paris, France , 23 May 2024 | Leigh Rogers

The official draws for the Roland Garros 2024 men’s and women’s singles competitions are set.

Alex de Minaur is among nine Australians contesting this year’s men’s singles event at Roland Garros, our highest representation since 1999.

The 25-year-old is the No.11 seed, which makes him the highest-seeded Australian in a Roland Garros men’s singles draw in 21 years.

De Minaur faces a challenging first-round assignment against rising American Alex Michelsen, who beat him at Los Cabos earlier this season.

Two Australians will meet in the opening round, with Alexei Popyrin and Thanasi Kokkinakis drawn to face each other.

Kokkinakis has won both of his previous meetings against Popyrin, who was crowned the Roland Garros boys’ singles champion in 2017.
