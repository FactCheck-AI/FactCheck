This bust of Posidonius is an Augustan copy (23 BC - AD 14) of an original of the Early 1st Century BC.

Posidonius "of Apameia" or "of Rhodes" (c. 135 BCE â€“ c. 51 BCE), was a Greek Stoic philosopher, politician, astronomer, geographer, historian and teacher native to Apamea, Syria.

He was acclaimed as the greatest polymath of his age. His vast body of work exists today only in fragments. Writers such as Strabo and Seneca provide most of the information, from history, about his life.
