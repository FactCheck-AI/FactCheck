In 2023, she was featured on the track "Told Ya" from Chlöe's debut studio album, In Pieces. Bailey told Rolling Stone of this collaboration, "Missy has been one of my biggest inspirations for a very, very, very, very, very long time. I was just happy and honored that I got to have her voice grace my debut album. When I received her vocals, I cried on the floor for 20 minutes. On a record that I wrote to tell everyone who's underestimated me, 'I told you I'd make it' even though I fully didn't believe it myself—for her to be on that record specifically, it really meant a lot. It's almost like proving to myself that, hey Chlöe, you are doing it. You're on the right path".[1] The two also happen to share the same birthday.
