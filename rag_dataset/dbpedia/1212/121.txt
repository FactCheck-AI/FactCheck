Missy Elliott is back. More than four years after her label started stoking interest in a new album, the rapper is set to release two new singles.

"Watch it world we backk!!!" announced the producer Timbaland, Elliott's longtime collaborator, on Twitter. "My sista @MissyElliott is droppin her singles #9thinning and #triplethreat labor day weekend." Labor Day is celebrated in North America on Monday 3 September. And Elliott is due to appear with Nas and Timbaland at a concert in Miami on 1 September.

Although Elliott has been working toward a seventh studio album since around 2007, the record known as Block Party has been postponed numerous times. She revealed last year that her main obstacle has been Graves' disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland. "I couldn't write because my nervous system was so bad â€“ I couldn't even use a pen," she told People. After almost dying in a car crash, Elliott underwent radiation therapy. "My thyroid is functioning, so I haven't had to take medication in about nine months. [But] you live with it for the rest of your life."

Lately, Elliott has been stepping back into the spotlight, guesting on singles by J Cole, Katy Perry, MIA and Demi Lovato. She and Timbaland performed together at a corporate event in April, where they debuted both new singles. 9th Inning reportedly samples lines from Run-DMC's Here We Go (Live at the Funhouse). The 41-year-old later joined Lil' Kim and Eve on stage at a concert in May.

Earlier this month, Elliott denied that she would have any role in an upcoming posthumous album featuring vocals by Aaliyah, one of Elliott's proteges, who died in 2001. "We have nothing but love and respect for [Aaliyah's] memory and for her loved ones left behind still grieving her loss," Elliott said in a statement. "She will always live in our hearts."

Elliott's most recent full-length album, 2005's The Cookbook, debuted at No2 in the US and reached No33 in the UK album charts.
