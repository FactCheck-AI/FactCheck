Synopsis

While Aamir Khan, Akshay Kumar and Vijay Deverakonda’s films failed to impress the Indian audience, Tom Cruise has successfully captivated the movie lovers with his block-bluster film Top Gun Maverick. After completing 100 days, the film’s gross collection is Rs 48.14 crore at the Indian box office.

The double attack of Tom Cruise’s charisma and the 80’s nostalgic quotient seems to be working great at the Indian box office. When most Bollywood films are failing to impress the Indian audience, Tom Cruise-starred Top Gun Maverick is continuing to run impressively even after completing its 100th day run in India.

On September 2, the Hollywood film completed its 100 days in Indian cinemas, and surprisingly, it is still showing super-strong performance in multiple centers. Believe it or not, if you track the ticket-selling apps, it would surprise you that Top Gun Maverick is still in a fast-filling or sold-out position during weekends!
