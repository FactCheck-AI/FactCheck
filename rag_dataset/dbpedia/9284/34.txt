Texas is called the Lone Star State because the first flag of the Republic of Texas adopted by the Congress in 1836 was blue with a golden star on it. This flag was known as the Burnet flag.

The later Republic flag, now the state flag, has one lone white star in the blue field next to white and red stripes. (The white stripe is above the red.)

==============================================

"Lone Star" state is Texas's nickname. Prior to the Mexican-American war, Texas gained independence from Mexico. Since Mexico had a large expanse of un-inhabited land, they allowed American settlers to live in the area. Stephen Austin (son of Moses Austin) urged the province to gain freedom. It's been called the Lone-Star Republic since.

Why does the Texas flag only have one star in it?

From colonial times, settlers in Texas used the lone star as a symbol of the area. Only ten days after Texas declared itself a republic, the Texas Provisional Government declared the single star to be the "particular emblem" of the Republic. Some sources state that the simple design and single star represented the united will of the citizens of the new Republic of Texas to throw off their former Mexican governors.
