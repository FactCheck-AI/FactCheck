Career

Originally a member of several rock groups around Liverpool, such as The Assassins and The Profiles, Molland began his recording career in 1965 when he joined The Masterminds. This group released a single on Immediate Records IM 005, consisting of a cover version of Bob Dylan's "She Belongs to Me" backed with a band original, "Taken My Love". After this the group disbanded and Molland joined the backing group of The Merseys. Although never recording with them, he did accompany them on tour.

Molland's recording career began in earnest in 1967 when he joined Gary Walker (formerly of the Walker Brothers) for the group 'Gary Walker & The Rain'. The Rain released several singles, an EP, and an album on the Polydor and Philips labels in the UK and Japan between 1967 and 1969. Titled #1, the album featured four Molland compositions and was especially well received in Japan, but a lack of success in their UK homebase caused the band to disband by 1969.

In November 1969, Molland auditioned for The Iveys and was hired. The Iveys were a conspicuous recording group at the time of Apple Records (a label launched by The Beatles). The Iveys changed their name to "Badfinger" after dismissing original bassist Ron Griffiths, and starting Molland as guitarist. The band enjoyed an early string of successful singles and albums for the next couple of years. During Molland's association with Apple, he made guest appearances on two George Harrison albums, All Things Must Pass and The Concert For Bangla Desh, and the John Lennon album, Imagine.

Molland left Badfinger in late 1974 due to disagreements over management. In 1975, he joined with Jerry Shirley (formerly of Humble Pie) and formed a group called Natural Gas. The band released the LP Natural Gas on Private Stock Records in 1976, and enjoyed a successful tour with Peter Frampton the following year. According to Molland, a general lack of organisation led to the band's demise late in 1977.

Molland and former Badfinger bandmate Tom Evans recorded two albums under the Badfinger name, Airwaves in 1978, and Say No More in 1981. He and Evans split after Say No More and the two performed in rival touring Badfinger bands until Evans' suicide in 1983.

Molland's career since 1983 has been with various rock groups and duos, and performing tours under the Badfinger name or as "Joey Molland's Badfinger". Earlier versions of these groups sometimes included original Badfinger drummer Mike Gibbins. Molland was instrumental in releasing a 1974 live recording of Badfinger on Rykodisc in 1991, called Day After Day: Live, which received mixed critical reactions due to overdubbing and a rearranged track order. Molland's solo recordings have been well received. His first, After The Pearl, was released in 1984 on Earthtone Records. His second, The Pilgrim, was released in 1992 on Rykodisc. His third, This Way Up, was independently released in 2001. His most current album, Return To Memphis, was released on 13 December 2013 .

Molland went back into the studio in 2015 with members of 10,000 Maniacs (Ladies First) to release a new version on the classic song, "Sweet Tuesday Morning" from Badfinger's 1972 album Straight Up. The collaboration, in partnership with HAIL! Fredonia Records of the State University of New York at Fredonia has aimed to "expand support to those in need of help and increase community empowerment" with proceeds supporting global non-for-profit organization, WhyHunger.

Personal life

Molland lives in Minnesota and has two grown children, Joseph Charles III and Shaun. He continues to tour under the Badfinger name. Molland was married to Kathie Wiggins Molland from 1972 until her death on 23 March 2009.
