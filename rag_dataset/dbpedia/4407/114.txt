Simple Concepts began in 2007 when Aaron Bernstein, Founder and CEO, saw the need for an agency nimble enough to provide consistency and efficiency regardless of a projectâ€™s timeline or budget. Trusted for over 15 years by companies of all sizes, from Fortune 500 enterprises to small local businesses, Simple Concepts is known for its creativity, flexibility, and quality.

Since our beginning, video production, creative design, and event management have always been the primary pillars of our business. What makes Simple Concepts different is the expertise and experience our team members bring in tight collaboration across projects. Separately, each of our teams produce outstanding results, and we are even better together.
