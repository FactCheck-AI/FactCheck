No, Philip Emeagwali did not invent either the internet or the computer and has never won a Nobel Prize. He is a Nigerian-born engineer and computer scientist/geologist who was one of two winners of the 1989 Gordon Bell Prize, a prize from the IEEE, for his use of a Connection Machine supercomputer to help analyze petroleum fields.

While Emeagwali claims a long list of inventions, they have been all refuted by media agencies. He has been accused of self-promotion and misrepresentation. His application for a PhD was rejected by the University of Michigan.
