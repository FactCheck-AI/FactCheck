Dear all,

I am attempting to install Copasi on a Ubuntu virtual machine. This is my attempt at figuring out how to install and use Copasi on Ubuntu before I update the Copasi software version on our cluster (we're currently running Copasi 89). I have:

1) downloaded and unzipped the Copasi installation files (to the directory '/home/cw00137/Desktop/COPASI-4.15.95-Linux-64bit')

2) Added an environment variable called COPASIDIR using the command 'export COPASIDIR=/home/cw00137/Desktop/COPASI-4.15.95-Linux-64bit'

Problems:

1) The CopasiUI file in the ./bin directory of the copasi installation files gets opened by default in a text editor. In order to get CopasiUI to actually run I need to first make it executable using the command 'chmod +x CopasiUI' and then run this using './CopasiUI'. I am however aware that it is possible to set it up so that CopasiUI will open using the command 'CopasiUI' (or 'CopasiSE Copasi_filename.cps'), since this is how it currently works on the cluster with build 89. Does anybody know how to set this up?

Additionally, if anybody has any advice on installing Copasi on a cluster it'd be greatly appreciated. I'm told it may be possible to use a script from the 'central node' using a repository but this is all the information I have.

Thanks

Ciaran
