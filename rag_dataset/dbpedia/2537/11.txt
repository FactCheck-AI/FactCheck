With the cold expected to the southwest in the next couple of days, you might want to travel to Maple Creek.

Why? Because according to Environment Canada, Maple Creek is the warmest place in the province.

Terri Lang, a meteorologist with Environment Canada, said Maple Creek's average temperature is almost two degrees warmer than Swift Current.

"If you look at the averages for temperature for an entire year over a 30-year period, the average temperature for Maple Creel is 5.8," she said. "If you look at Swift Current, which is close to Maple Creek, the average temperature is 4.1. You can see the difference in temperatures, and 5.8 over 4.1 is a significant margin."

Lang said there are a couple of factors that come into play to make Maple Creek the warmest place.

"It's in the southerly part of Saskatchewan, so it's not close to Stoney Rapids, so latitude plays into it," she said. "It's more westerly that many of the places, so it benefits from the Chinooks that come off the Rockies. Those Chinooks help melt the snow quicker and make it easier for Maple Creek to warm up. Then there is the proximity to Cypress Hills which is quite the high elevation place. Cypress has a southerly and southwesterly flow through the higher atmosphere, so the air forces over Cypress Hills and comes down towards Maple Creek and warms it up.

Lang said that Maple Creek could only claim the warmest place in Saskatchewan as places like Medicine Hat have a higher average temperature.

Maple Creek so far this year has had an average temperature of -5.7, while Swift Current has an average temperature of -7.4.
