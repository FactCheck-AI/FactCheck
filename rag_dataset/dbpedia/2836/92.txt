TEACHER EDUCATION

The Teacher Education program offers a Bachelor of Education (BEd) offered full-time program that leads to a recommendation for certification by the Ontario College of Teachers valid in Ontario schools where English is the language of instruction.

This program is designed to educate teachers to be knowledgeable, skilled and reflective professionals capable of working in partnership with members of the community.

The Bachelor of Education (BEd) is divided into three divisions: primary/junior (k-grade 6) junior/intermediate (4-10), and intermediate/senior (7-12). In all three divisions, students learn educational theory and explore research in the field. Students also receive instruction on current teaching approaches and skills. Through field studies and the practicum, students are given opportunities to reflect on the links between theory and practice and to consider their own emerging practice.

The Ontario College of Teachers is responsible for licensing and regulating the teaching profession in the public interest. Students are responsible for ensuring that the College recognizes the degree on which their admission to the Bachelor of Education is based. The University of Ottawa is responsible only for ensuring the degree meets the admission criteria for the Bachelor of Education itself.

This program is offered in English only.
