Species 8 (8 in the flora).

Section Unguiculatae encompasses a series of species that have radiated in montane meadows in California, from Siskiyou and Trinity counties through the Sierra Nevada to the San Bernardino Mountains, and in the Carson, Virginia, and Pine Nut ranges in adjacent Nevada; one variety of Ivesia argyrocoma is endemic to the Sierra San Pedro MÃ¡rtir in Baja California, Mexico. The species occur in seasonally wet/dry meadows and flats, including some specific substrate types of localized occurrence that often support suites of endemic species. The most widespread species in the section, I. kingii, has adapted to alkali-crusted valley bottoms extending across the Great Basin to western Utah.

Members of sect. Unguiculatae are nearly glabrous to densely sericeous but lack the conspicuous glandularity and distinctive ivesioid smell that characterize sects. Ivesia and Setosae. The taproot is often elongate and fleshy-thickened, which is apparently an adaption for when the preferred habitat becomes seasonally desiccated. Leaves are cylindric with deeply lobed leaflets. Flowers are usually aggregated into multiple few- to many-flowered glomerules; sometimes they are individually arranged in diffuse inflorescences. Petals are white to pale yellow but never golden yellow and are often conspicuously clawed. Stamens are commonly 20 except in Ivesia campestris and I. unguiculata.
