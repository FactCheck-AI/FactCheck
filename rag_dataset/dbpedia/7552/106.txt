Description

The Córdoba is the official currency in Nicaragua since 1912, replacing the “peso current currency”. The country had a period of monetary chaos that caused the inclusion of córdoba in 3 different stages, the last being after the 1990s. Notes were introduced in denominations of 1, 5, 10 and 25 centavos, ½, 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 córdobas. Coins between 1994 and 1997 replaced the 1 and 5 córdobas notes. The 500 córdobas note were included five years later. In 2015 the Banco Central de Nicaragua issued a new series of notes in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100, 200 and 500 córdobas, followed by the 1000 córdoba note in 2016.

The 500 Córdobas note front features the Cathedral of León. The reverse note side has Momotombo volcano. This note is part of the 2014 serie and, its color is red.
