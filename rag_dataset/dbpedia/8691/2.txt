Born in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, JAMES CAMERON grew up in the historic village of Chippawa, near Niagara Falls. In 1971, he moved to Brea, California where he studied physics at Fullerton Junior College while working as a machinist and, later, a truck driver. Cameron quit his trucking job in 1978 and raised money from local dentists to produce a 35mm short film.

The visual effects in this film led to work on Roger Corman's BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS (1980), on which he served as production designer, matte artist and visual effects DP.
