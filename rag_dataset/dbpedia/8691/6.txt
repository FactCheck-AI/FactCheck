Bio:

James Cameron (born James Francis Cameron on August 16, 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian filmmaker, director, producer and screenwriter. After dropping out of college and taking a bunch of odd jobs, James decided to join the film industry in 1977. He first found success with The Terminator in 1984, which he wrote himself, but had trouble selling since no one wanted to work with an inexperienced director. He finally connected with his future wife, Gale Anne Hurd, who had her own production company, and they produced the box office hit. He followed up with movies like Aliens, the Abyss and Terminator 2, but his biggest success came in 1997 with Titanic, which he wrote and directed. After that, he began working on Avatar, which didn’t end up hitting theaters until 2009 and became the highest-grossing movie of all time. He won the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Film Editing for Titanic, and was nominated in the same categories for Avatar. He’s currently working on four sequels to Avatar, the first set to premiere in 2018.
