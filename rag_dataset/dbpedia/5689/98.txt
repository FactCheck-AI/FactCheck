Our Lady of Miracles Cathedral, formerly known as the Our Lady of Miracles Church, is a Roman Catholic Cathedral situated at Kallianpur in the Udupi district of Karnataka, India.

The Milagres Church was established in 1680 as a result of a treaty between Raja Shivappa Nayaka (the Ikkeris) of Bednore and the Portuguese in Goa and Bombay-Bassein. The structure was rebuilt in its present form in 1881 AD, after the persecution of Mangalorean Christians at Seringapatam ended. The Milagres parish was elevated to the status of a cathedral church in 2012, giving a desirable service to the people of Kallianpur.
