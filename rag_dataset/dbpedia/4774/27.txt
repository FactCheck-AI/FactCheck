Featured Project Description:

Submission to the Imagination Cube competition. Unrealistic concept exploring just one real construction material. We didn’t think about gravity, costs, area, or real life. All with the purpose of exercising the imagination muscles that we sometimes forget when doing real projects on tight deadlines. Through this playful exercise we were hoping to activate thinking outside the box when we went back to dealing with reality.
