Children of the Ghetto

Israel Zangwill (1864 - 1926)

In this 1892 novel of London's Jewish East End, Israel Zangwill sets the apparently irrational and decidedly indecorous religious practices of transplanted eastern European Jews against the forces of assimilation. Zangwill's knowledge of Yiddishkeit and skill in melodrama created a series of unforgettable vignettes that had a significant effect on the public perception of this much stigmatized immigrant group.

Israel Zangwill (1864-1926) was born in London of Russian and Polish parents. He coined the term cultural "melting pot". (Summary by Adrian Praetzellis)
