Croatia is a parliamentary democracy and is organised as a unitary republic. The welfare state, freedom, equality, equal rights and the rule of law are among the highest values of the constitutional order. The political system is based on the principle of the division of power into three branches: the legislative, the executive and the judiciary. The Croatian Parliament, or Sabor has a single house and has inherited many centuries of parliamentary tradition; its members are elected for four years. The President of the Republic, who is elected by general, direct election for a period of five years, represents the country abroad, cooperates with the Government in shaping and implementing foreign policy and commands the armed forces. The Government proposes laws and the State Budget, leads foreign and internal policy, and directs and monitors the work of the state administration. Croatia is divided administratively into 20 counties and the City of Zagreb. Alongside the judiciary, the institute of the Ombudsman promotes and protects the legal rights of citizens. There are also Ombudsmen for Children, Gender Equality, and Persons with Disabilities.
