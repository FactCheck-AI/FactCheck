The Guyana National Bureau of Standards (GNBS) develops and enforces national standards and regulations. All product labels must be in English. Restrictive advertising is limited to cigarettes. GNBS issues standards and guideline documents for labelling. These guidelines are the GYS9-1 and GYS 9-2 general requirements for labeling and requirements for labeling pre-packaged foods. The standards can be purchased from the GNBS. U.S. exporters and potential exporters are encouraged to contact the GNBS about the labeling and marking requirements for specific classes of goods before exporting to Guyana.
