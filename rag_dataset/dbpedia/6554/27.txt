"Gone With The Wind"

Vivien Leigh

(without

Sir Laurence)

witt star

an Aussie tour

By BETTY BEST, of our London staff

VIVIEN LEIGH will

come to Australia in

July to lead the Old Vic's

world tour -and for the

first time in 20 years she

will be facing her public

without the personal and

professional support of Sir

Laurence Olivier.

It is a great challenge-the

beginning of a new life at the

age of 47.

For Australia, the coming

season of the Old Vic tour

promises a " cultural treat for

theatregoers.

The Old Vic, directed by

IRobert Helpmann, opens in

Australia on July 12, closes

January, 1962, takes in Mel-

bourne, Brisbane, Sydney,

Adelaide, Perth, playing

"Twelfth Night," "Lady of thc

Camellias," "Duel of Angels."

SAnd when Vivien is in Aus-

tralia, her most famous role of

all will come to life again.

"Gone With The Wind" will

again be showing.

Vivien begins her tour in a

country which 13 years ago

welcomed her as a figure in a

famous love story.

All over the world Vivien

Leigh's marriage with Sir

Laurence Olivier was re-

garded as a story no less ro-

mantic than the parts she

played.

Her beauty and charm had

been the perfect feminine

counterpart to a handsome and

talented husband. Here was

a pair in the grand theatre

tradition.

For younger generations

they had the added attrac-

tion of youth.

It is hard to estimate the

value of such a partnership to

both its members.

In the past year she has

been through the disillusion-

ment of watching her home

sold, her marriage end in

divorce, and her husband

marry young English actress

Joan Plowright.

iVeu? husband ?

Meantime, her own name

has been linked romantically

-there has even been talk of

a marriage-with actor John

Merivale.

Bearded John Merivale,

whom Australians will see with

the Old Vic Company, is a

son of actress Gladys Cooper.

As I travelled to Elstree

Studios to see Vivien for the

first time since all these events,

I wondered how much they

had changed her.

Only once before had I

met her without Sir-Laurence.

That was in Nottingham for

the English premiere of

"Summer of the Seventeenth

Doll."

Then, though we talked all

night of her future plans, she

never once said "I." It was

always "We," or "Larry and

L" It was the same when we

talked about a future Austra-

lian tour. She made it clear

that Sir Laurence was terribly

sorry to miss the Nottingham

premiere, and that only his

West End run in "The Enter-

tainer" kept him away.

(It was in "The Enter-

tainer" that he acted for the

first time with Joan Plow

right)

Since then I have seen and

met them many times at mid-

night charity matinees in sev-

eral London theatres.

There were always excited

cries of "Here come Viv and

Larry."

But it is "Viv and Larry"

no more. It's just "Viv" now.

And as I walked on to the set

of "The Roman Spring of

Mrs. Stone" I was apprehen-

sive of. what this would mean

to a woman as truly feminine

as Vivien Leigh.

Instead of her former re-

laxed and friendly greeting

she gave me a quick formal

smile. But she was working on

a long and difficult- scene and

I felt, and hoped, she was just

preoccupied.

Her blond wig and beadÃ©d

white sheath satin dress, which

was garnished with a wealth of

pearl earrings, necklaces, and

bracelets, made her look a

little older than when I had

last seen her.

But as soon as the shooting

lights picked up the girlish

smoothness of her perfect skin,

any impression of added years

disappeared.

And as soon as shooting

began the star quality was

there.

On the set she has her own

caravan, where she rests be-

tween scenes. It was there

she took me during her first

break.

I'd been warned that I must

just snatch whatever spare

minutes iwe might get during

> the day, so I dashed straight

into her reasons for return-

ing to Australia on. tour.

"Oh, eveiything. You know

. I've always wanted to go

back. I love it all. The

country, the people, the ani-

mals."

Then she was silent.

It took ten minutes of

chatter before I learned that

she had been very attracted

to Australian painting on her

last visit in 1948.

"I have several still. A

Bill Constable, a Drysdale,

and a Bill Dobell landscape.

Some are in store, of course.

They used to be in the coun-

try-not in the Eaton Square

flat."

For a minute a shadow

crossed her face at the men-

tion of her old home Nottley

Abbey. Then with a determina-

tion that brooked no argu-

ment she changed the subject.

It was a warning as clear as a

red light. She would have

no talk of the past.

I asked Miss Leigh if she

and Mr. Helpmann were keen

on introducing new names

on the Old Vic tour, as

Mary Home, Alan Webb, and

John Merivale, the other fea-

ture players, were not well

known in Australia.

. "One just tries to get the

best company one can," she

said. "We may be playing to-

gether for two years if we go

to all the places we want to.

Not everyone can plan to be

on tour for as long as that. We

feel we have an excellent

company and are very happy

with it."

The tour

After Australia the Old Vic

will go to Hongkong, Singa-

pore, Bangkok, then possibly

back to New Zealand.

"Then we hope to fit in a

season in Paris, appear at the

Athens Festival, and play both

North and South America.

"Then we MUST go to

Moscow. I long to go to Mos-

cow. It sounds one of the

most exciting places in the

world to play."

It sounded a pretty exhaust-

ing couple of years.

"But I adore touring," she

said. "And I love work. And

it will be a much easier trip

this time. We will have two

weeks' holiday every three

months."

"You had less last trip?" I

said.

"Yes." But Miss Leigh

switched the subject again.

She seemed to reiax only

when the luncheon break was

called. I had been warned

that she never lunched with

journalists, so I prepared to

make myself scarce.

To my surprise she said,

"You will lunch with me,

0 While Vivien Leigh is in Australia

this year starring for the Old Vic on

the stage, her most famous film, "Gone

ivith the Wind" will be revived on the

screen in Australia's cinemas. Vivien

Leigh married Laurence Olivier soon

after her Scarlett triumph 21 years ago.

won't you? On thc under-

standing you stop work as

much as I do while we eat."

I promised, and we chatted

about everything but vhe tour.

Back on the set, her chauf-

feur and maid Trudi had ar-

rived with a vast carpet-bag

bulging with hand-wrapped

presents which Miss' Leigh

had chosen herself for every

individual in the cast and

crew. It was a task, which

must have taken her hours.

Every parcel had its own hand-

written note.

"This ii the greatest fun of

doing any show," she said.

I learned afterwards that

she has been doing it ever since

she became a star.

And Miss Leigh was a star

at an, unusually young age.

How great a star all over

the world is epitomised by the

fact that this month -she was

flown to Atlanta, Georgia, to

be the guest of honor at a

traditional Southern Ball,

arranged to celebrate the re-

issue of "Gone with the Wind."

It is also the centenary of

the American Civil War.

It is 21 years since the film

?was made, and it has been

such a continuous success that

the studios are now giving it

fresh premieres all over the

world to celebrate its coming

of-agc. It is an unprecedented

honor for any actress.

It was not hard to remem

her Scarlett O'Hara as I left

the set of "The Roman Spring

of Mrs. Stone."

Vivien, a tiny figure in a

loose Chinese kimono with

little black flat-heeled slippers,

sat on one side of the caravan

table. At the other sat the

chauffeur, Ben. ^ Both heads

were bent over a game of

Russian' Banker with such

childish concentration that

they might have been doing

school homework.

But instead it was relaxa-

tion and a pause from work.

For the first time that day she

had let down her barriers of

professionalism.

It was hard to believe that

the glamorous star in the

natural mink who would drive

away in the pearl-grey Rolls

later that evening and the

little figure in the slippers

were part of the enigma that

is Vivien Leigh.

But anyone looking closely

at the Rolls will see, even

there, the same stroke rif sen-

timentality which makes her

choose and wrap all those

presents for her fellow

workers.

The number plate of the car

is still VL012?.
