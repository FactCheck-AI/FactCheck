BROOKINGS â€” South Dakota State Athletics will host an open house on Sept. 27 to celebrate the First Bank & Trust Arena renovation project.

The event begins at 5 p.m. and will consist of self-guided tours of the entire facility, with student-athletes on hand to visit with guests. The Friday evening celebration concludes with a short program in the arena at 6:30 p.m.

Fans attending the event must enter at the new southeast entrance; parking will be available in the lots across the street to the east the of the facility.

The First Bank & Trust Arena project includes new premium seating areas and suites, state-of-the-art video board and display systems, a new sound system, a more spacious concourse, and improved restrooms to enhance the fan and event experience in a facility that first opened as Frost Arena in 1973. New and improved locker rooms and coaching offices are also a part of the renovated arena, which will maintain a seating capacity of about 5,000.

The two-year renovation and expansion project was spearheaded by a $20 million commitment from Brookings-based First Bank & Trust.

In further preparation for the re-opening of the facility, season ticket deposits for the 2024-25 volleyball and wrestling seasons are being accepted through July 16, with time slots for selecting seats to be determined by Jackrabbit Club priority points as of July 19.

Basketball season ticket holders for the 2024-25 season will receive further information via mail in July, with dates for seat selection scheduled for the week of Sept. 9-13.
