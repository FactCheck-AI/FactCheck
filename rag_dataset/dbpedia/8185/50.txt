Reach Global is a ministry of Faith Assembly, designed to reach people by meeting physical and spiritual needs across the globe. You can expect visits from real-life missionaries in our midweek services, a monthly missions emphasis in our weekend services, and an annual Missions Week every fall.

Join our Reach Global Prayer Team every Sunday morning in Room B214 at 11:15am. Here you will be interceding for prayer requests submitted by the 1000+ missionaries that Faith supports.

Additionally, become part of our 52 Weeks of Prayer community, a Facebook group committed to praying year-round for global missions!

A Reach Global mission trip is a short-term experience where small teams serve with our international partners, meeting the physical and spiritual needs of people all over the world. Our vision is for Reach Global mission trips to be opportunities for people to pursue spiritual growth and healthy relationships through serving.
