We acknowledge that the Catholic District School Board of Eastern Ontario gathers today on the unceded, traditional Algonquin territory of the Anishinaabe people, as well as the traditional Mohawk territory of the Haudenosaunee people. We respect both the land and the people of this land, including all Indigenous people who have walked and continue to walk in this place.
