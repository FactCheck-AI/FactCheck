I'm trying to customize the thumbnail images for each blog post as they appear on the blog page. The aspect ratio of the images I'm using is about 4:1, and I'd like to make the images smaller - 150px width by 38px height. I've tried using the custom css code in other forum posts (linked below), but they haven't worked for me. I'm using a single-column blog and would ideally like to have the thumbnail images resized, then the image appear between the blog title and the preview text.
