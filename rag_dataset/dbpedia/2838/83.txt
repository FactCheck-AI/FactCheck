Double quotation marks are used around the shortened title of the web page in the in-text citation only.

In the in-text citation, the words of the shortened title in quotation marks are capitalized. In the Reference list, only the first word and proper names are capitalized.

Move the title to the first position of the reference when there is no author listed.

In the Public Health Agency of Canada example, the author was the same as the publisher, so the publisher was not included in the reference.

In the Canadian Wildlife example, the name of the specific agency that authored the report (Canadian Wildlife Agency) was different from its parent organization (Environment Canada), so Environment Canada is listed as the publisher.

When a URL is too long to fit on one line, create a break where there is punctuation (period, slash, dash). As you can see in the example, the punctuation starts the next line. Do not end the URL with a period if it is not in the original.
