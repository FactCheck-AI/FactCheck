You should mention exactly by which border point you plan to enter Romania and where in Bulgaria do you want to get.

Anyway, just as an example, a simple route would be this one:

-enter Romania by the Bors border station;

-follow the DN1 road through Oradea-Cluj-Turda-Alba Iulia-Sibiu (this part should take about 6 hours);

-switch to the the DN7 road Sibiu-Ramnicu Valcea-Pitesti (should take 2-3 So, hours);

-use the A1 motorway between Pitesti and Bucharest (one hour);

-bypass Bucharest on the ring road (at least one hour, but it depends on traffic);

-use the DN5 road from Bucharest to Giurgiu (one hour) and then just cross the bridge across the Danube into Bulgaria (to the city of Ruse);

Overall the drive through Romania should be at least 12-13 hours.
