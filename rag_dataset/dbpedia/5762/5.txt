This 1948 Lancia Aprilia is a second-series example with coachbuilt cabriolet bodywork from Swiss carrosserie Langenthal. The car, chassis 539-1096, remained in Switzerland until 2013, when it was relocated to the Netherlands. It was purchased by the current owner and imported to the US in 2016. Finished in pale blue over dark blue leather, the car is powered by a 1,486cc OHC V4 paired with a four-speed manual transmission. Additional features include a dark blue convertible top, a single Zenith 32 VIML carburetor, sliding-pillar front suspension, and four-wheel drum brakes. This Langenthal-bodied Aprilia is part of the privately owned Hadjopulos collection, a portion of which is currently being auctioned on BaT by a representative of Mr. Hadjopulos. It was previously featured on BaT in 2016 while still in Europe and is now offered with a clean Texas title.

The Aprilia entered production in 1937 and was offered primarily as a four-door pillarless sedan. Construction of the unibody car was handled in-house by Lancia, though the model was also produced in chassis-only form so that coachbuilders could create their own bodywork. The second series of the Aprilia, introduced in 1939, was available to coachbuilders in three wheelbases, the longest of which was the 2,950mm Tipo 539 lungo chassis that underpins this car.

Founded in the 1920s, Langenthal crafted cabriolet bodywork for popular European and American models through the late 1940s. The aluminum body on this car was repainted in its current shade of pale blue during a refurbishment that was carried out within the last decade. Exterior features include body-colored bumpers, pivot-out door handles, butterfly-hinged hood panels, and a dark blue convertible top.

Ivory-colored 400mm wheels wear polished Lancia hubcabs and Michelin X tires, and a matching spare is secured in the trunk. Stopping is handled by hydraulic drum brakes all around. The suspension incorporates Lancia’s independent, sliding-pillars up front, and long-wheelbase cars like this one utilize a solid axle out back instead of the Aprilia sedan’s independent setup.

The cabin retains a right-hand-drive configuration and features seating for four trimmed in blue leather. Color-keyed upholstery covers the doors and center tunnel, complemented by dark blue carpeting and a dark blue top boot.

An ivory-colored, banjo-spoke steering wheel frames a 160-km/h speedometer, fuel meter, and clock, as well as gauges for oil pressure and coolant temperature. The five-digit odometer shows 61k kilometers (~38k miles), though true mileage is unknown. Approximately 100 miles have been added during current ownership.

The 1,486cc V4 features an aluminum block with a 17° angle between cylinder banks, in addition to a single cylinder head with hemispherical combustion chambers and a single overhead camshaft serving both cylinder banks. Induction is through a Zenith 32 VIML carburetor, and power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transmission. Fluid changes were performed in spring 2020.
