Croatia received an invitation from NATO on Thursday to join the military alliance, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced at the NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania. Congratulations and welcome to our family, De Hoop Scheffer told reporters. The 26 NATO member states extended the invitation to Croatia at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which was also attended by Croatian President Stjepan Mesic and Prime Minister Ivo Sanader. A membership invitation was also extended to Albania, while Macedonia's invitation was blocked by Greece over the former Yugoslav republic's name.
