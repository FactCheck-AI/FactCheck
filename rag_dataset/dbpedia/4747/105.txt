More problems for Arizona Summit Law School, formerly known as the Phoenix School of Law. The American Bar Association has found the private school’s finances are not sufficient to meet its standards.

These findings come on the heels of the school’s being on probation for low passage rates on the State Bar exam. The ABA is asking the law school to submit a report by Feb. 1.
