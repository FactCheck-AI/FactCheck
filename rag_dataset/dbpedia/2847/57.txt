Jay Doyle Brown, Jr., breathed his last breath in the early morning of Nov. 23, 2023.

An authentic, gregarious, and sweet man leaves behind three siblings: Nicholas Brown of Jackson, Missouri (Mary), Shawn Brown of Poplar Bluff, Missouri, and Kimberly Carter of Nashville, Tennessee (Cole); seven nieces and nephews and eight great-nieces, and great-nephews.

He was preceded in death by his parents Jay D. Brown, Sr. and Thelma Mae Brown.

A private memorial is planned for a later time. The family is especially grateful for the outpouring of care and love Jay D. received from Specialty Services staff: Tina Hillis, Michael Vaughn, Heather Evans, Kelley Atchley, DJ Dennis, and Scottie Hunt. The family requests your continued prayers.
