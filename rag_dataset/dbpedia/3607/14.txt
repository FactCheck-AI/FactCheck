Updates:

I moved information about the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to the Azerbaijan page, since it now seems unlikely that it will unite with Armenia.

International standard ISO 3166-2 was published on 1998-12-15. It superseded ISO/DIS 3166-2 (draft international standard). The draft standard showed a division of Armenia into eleven provinces. Each one had a two-digit ISO code. The final standard shows the same eleven provinces, but their ISO codes have been changed to two-letter codes, and the status of Erevan has been changed from province to city. The new set of codes is listed below.

Armenia was under Russian domination for most of the 20th century. As part of Czarist Russia, it was the district of Erivan. At that time it included some territory south of the Aras (Araks) River, which it lost to Turkey in World War I. Armenia was independent from 1917 to 1920. For part of that period, it belonged to the Transcaucasian Federation, along with Azerbaijan and Georgia. Armenia became part of the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republic on 1922-03-12. This became one of the constituent republics of the U.S.S.R. later that year. In 1936 the Transcaucasian S.S.R. was split into the three republics again. The Commonwealth of Independent States supplanted the U.S.S.R. on 1991-12-08. Armenia became a member of the C.I.S. that same month.

Primary subdivisions:

Armenia is divided into ten gavaṙ (provinces) and one kaghak (city).

Province: Each division is a province, except Erevan, which is a city. There are

numerous ways to transliterate these names from Armenian. Here they are

shown as in the book "Administrative Subdivisions of Countries".

HASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes. If periods are replaced by

hyphens, these are the same as the province codes from ISO standard 3166-2.

FIPS: Codes from FIPS PUB 10-4, a U.S. government standard.

Population: 2001-10-10 census.

Areas: Total includes Lake Sevan, which is not counted in any of the provinces.

Capital: Names in parentheses are from the period of Soviet domination.

Postal codes:

Armenia appears still to be using Soviet-era postal codes, six-digit numbers always beginning with '37'.

Territorial extent:

Gelark'unik' includes the small Artsvashen exclave, containing the town of Bashkend, surrounded by Azerbaijan.

The UN LOCODE page for Armenia lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.

Origins of names:

Erevan: possibly from Armenian erevan: to appear or show, implying that it was the first place to appear after the Biblical flood.

Change history:

Under the Soviet Union, Armenia was the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (Armyanskaya Sovyetskaya Sotsialisticheskaya Respublika). According to the Atlas of Armenia, as of 1991-01-01, Armenia was divided into 37 raions, as shown in the table below. The atlas notes that Aragadz and Nairi were formed in 1972, and Baghramyan in 1983; the others are presumably older.

According to the 1995 CIA World Factbook, Armenia consisted of 37 shrjanner (regions): Akhuryan, Amasiya, Ani, Aparan, Aragats, Ararat, Armavir, Artashat, Art'ik, Ashots'k', Ashtarak, Baghramyan, Ejmiatsin, Goris, Gugark', Hrazdan, Ijevan, Kamo, Kapan, Kotayk', Krasnoselsk, Martuni, Masis, Meghri, Nairi, Noyemberyai, Sevan, Sisian, Spitak, Step'anavan, T'alin, Tashir, Taush, T'umanyan, Vardenik, Vayk', Yeghegnadzor; and 23 kaghakner (cities): Abovyan, Alaverdi, Ararat, Artashat, Art'ik, Ashtarak, Ch'arents'avan, Dilijan, Ejmiatsin, Goris, Gyumri, Hoktemberyan, Hrazdan, Ijevan, Jermuk, Kamo, Kapan, Metsamor, Sevan, Spitak, Step'anavan, Vanadzor, and Yerevan. These regions don't seem to correspond exactly with those listed in the table, but a partial key to the correspondence is probably: Ani = Aghin, Ararat = Vedi, Armavir = Hoktemberyan, Kapan = Ghap'an, T'umanyan = Alaverdi, Tashir = Kalinino, Taush = Shamshadin, Vardenik = Basargech'ar, and Vayk' = Azizbekov.

1995-07-05: Armenia re-organized into the current ten provinces and one city.
