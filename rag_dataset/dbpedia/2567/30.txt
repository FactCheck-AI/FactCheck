On Wednesday, actor and comedian Bob Einstein passed away at the age of 76. Einstein was most widely known for his creation and portrayal of goofy stuntman Super Dave Osborne, as well as his roles on shows such as Curb Your Enthusiasm and Arrested Development.

People will remember for Einstein, a two-time Emmy winner, for a wide range of his roles and other reasons, but Super Dave holds a special place among them. Today, we’re thinking of some of his best and most memorable stunts and skits.

Of course, we would have to start with his wrecking ball stunt, when the daredevil was wrecked for our entertainment.

Einstein’s first variety show with the Super Dave character got its start in Toronto. He endeared himself to Canadians very quickly with his jump from the top of the CN Tower.

The guy loved his jumps.

The piano on the top of the truck stunt is a classic. This had maybe one of the best twists to any Super Dave stunt ever!

This archery stunt had us all holding our breaths for real.

Super Dave even roped Mr. T into one of his crazy stunts, and it was everything that we could’ve hoped for.

Super Dave loved his motorsports too, of a sort. First, he roped a demolition derby car into a ridiculous stunt — and then, he would one-up himself by bringing in monster trucks.

How could we forget the balloon ball stunt? This led to some of the most memorable Super Dave imagery that we can recall.

Rest in peace, Bob Einstein.​
