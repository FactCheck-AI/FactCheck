In respect to both aspects the treatment of the lesson was a surprise, comingfrom a most busy man of secular affairs and from a Presbyterian. But so full of tenderness was the picture of Christ that it could not have been more, beautifully colored, had the painter been a devoted missionary and evangelist, whose daily occupation was to win souls and preach the glad tidings of salvation. And so devoid of legalistic, Sabbatarian cant was the instruction on Sabbath-observance, that one was led, as one seldom is when this question is discussed, to see the gift-side, the beneficent, benediction-side of the sacred Altogether the graphic picture of day.

General Peter Muhlenberg was the most distinguished of the PennsylvaniaGermans in the army. Pie was the trusted friend of Washington and other generals. He led the reserve-troops in the battle of

Long

before the North expected the close approach of the Rebellion of 1861 long before the South resolved to secede, did the foresight of the Germans in St. Louis and other places lead them to drill the members of their athletic societies in the manual of arms for the defense of the Union. When Abraham Lincoln called on Missouri for her quota of soldiers, the Governor replied indignantly that Missouri would never furnish soldiers to fight her sister States. But that Governor did not take into account the

Germans and their influence in his State. At the close of the Civil War, Missouri had given more soldiers in defense of the Union than Massachusetts, the so-called rock of anti-slavery. Four hundred thousand Germans served in the Union army and

[The object of the article from which the following extract is taken was to refute two assumptions made by a previous correspondent of the Dispatch. The first of these assumptions was that "pure German'' is a language native to the soil of Germany and the natural product of the German people; the other, that the Pennsylvania-German dialect is a corruption of this pure language of the fatherland. Rev. Stibitz's remarks confirm the assertion made editorially in our November issue, that the Pennsylvania-German originally was as good and pure a dialect as any spoken in

Germany. Ed.] Pure German is nowhere naturally spoken in Germany. It is always a language that has been directly or indirectly learned in the schools or from literature. There are as many dialects as there are petty kingdoms in Germany. These differ in some cases so much from each other as to be unintelligible to all who are not to the manner born. I have often found words and phrases in the speech of old Bavarians, Hessians and northern Germans in general, which I could not underAccording stand, though a German by birth. to a statement recently made to me by the pastor of one of the large German congregations

So-called pure German is in a sense artificial", as if is made up of the best elements of all the differing dialects and grammatically reduced to a system. The father, so to speak,

of this German literary language was Martin Luther. Before his time even the German book language vacillated between the many After his vigorous iiialects of the country and able construction of the language it was gradually adopted by all learned men. and now every one who lays any claim to education or desires a medium of intercourse with all the Germans must use this language. is therefore taught in the sch Is It Pennsylvania-Gerpreached in the pulpits. will not tolerate anvthing else in mans even It was made by the learned their churches.

Beginning with a geographical outline of the Shenandoah Valley, the author gives an account of the exploration and settlement of the country and then goes on to describe the people in their home and church life, "in their schools, fields and workshops, and in the larger relations of Church and State as affected by peace and war." An Appendix of 58 pages, giving lists of names of inhabitants, members of Congress and the Virginia Legislature, Revolutionary pensioners, etc., also an extended bibliography, adds much to the interest and value of the book.

This is a really elegant souvenir of last year's celebration of German Day in Chicago, comprising about forty quarto paa'ts of appropriate reading-matter and a number of fine illustrations. Its leading feature is a history of the Germans in America, carefully prepared from reliable sources by Emil Mannhardt, secretary of the German-American Historical Society of Illinois, and a contributor to this magazine. It also contains the oration delivered by Dr. C. J. Hexamer, of Philadelphia, president of the National German- American Alliance, at the Jamestown Exposition, on German Day, Aug. 1, 1907, in the original

Schuler, settled on this tract, which was then known as Goshenhoppen, and reared a family of four sons and two daughters. Their sons were John, Daniel, Gabriel and William, who were born on this homestead. They all served in the army of the Revolution, the first three being officers. John and Daniel afterwards became members of Congress, the former from Chester, the latter from Berks county, to which the Hiesters had removed. A number of the descendants of the family, up to the present day, have preserved the family reputation for useful activity and faithful devotion to business and political interests. On a tract of about 165 acres, the elder Hiester here carried on fanning. conducted a tannery and engaged in the manufacture of brick and tiling. He died in 1795, aged eighty-two years, and was the uncle of Governor Joseph Hiester.

The Patch-Work

Revival of

BY

THE HOME

The

revival of the old-fashioned bright colored patch-work quilt recalls many pleasant little incidents and memories of the past to those who spent the long winter evenings in framing together patches, often as a household necessity but oftener as a labor of love for those near and dear to them. It was the sentiment of grandmother's day that the boys must have several pieced quilts when they leave home, and the girls must see that they have their own pieced. This old-time handicraft, which had almost become a lost art, is becoming very popular again, and the handsome coverlets stored in the chest on the attic for years, as loving remembrances of by-gone days, can now again be brought forth to be of useful service and to replace the more modern successor, the machine-made spread which has held sway for many years. When we see the artistic designs and harmonious color blending that some of these spreads contain we look with admiration and often a little envy thereon, and realize that in spite oi the advanced ideas of the present generation, the old folks did know a thing or two in their day, and we must confess that grandmother's patchwork quilt is as- pretty and acceptable to us today as it was to her several decades ago. While it was one of her occupations thro' the long winter evenings, it was also a pastime for any idle hours of the day, and if there was a neighbor's call to be made she was likely to have a dozen or more of carefully cut .patches tucked under her arm which she took along to sew on while indulging in a little Xot always was she alone engaged social chat. in piecing, but very often the little seven-yearold tot, at her grandmother's knee, would take .

His appeal to the New England coloiiies is ignored. Its citizens, forgetting their patriotism of the early days of the struggle, are now gathering within the folds of the British hag. Congress delays, the resources of the Committee of Safety are exhausted, they, a few months previous, sanctioning the sale to the colony of Virginia of one thousand stand of arms from the Forks of the Delaware.

The Committee of Safety for the County of Northampton now passes its famous resolution which debars from participation in these armed forces now gathering, all persons possessing a knowledge of the manufacture of firearms. Among the Swiss and Palatine population of the vast territory then known as Northampton county were a great many who were gunsmiths and armorers, some of whom were descendants of the ancient armorers of the feudal period of Central Europe. These people brought with them to Pennsylvania the rifle, forty years or more before the Revolution and improved upon this German model with such ingenuity that up to within a few years oi this important event, they had produced a newtype of firearm, superior to any other in the

Abraham Berlin had taken up the vocation of blacksmithing in Easton, but was a gunsmith during the entire period of the Revolution, after which he again resumed blacksmithing. Stephen Horn lived at Easton, put in several years at gun work and then took up that of powder making. Isaac Berlin and John Young, both from the upper end of the county, took up their residence in Easton about the time of agitation. Perlin's specialty was sword making. John Young was an armorer and an engraver or decorator. The decorations on Berlin's swords and on his own rifles were very artistic. He also decorated the guns for his brother Henry. Henry Young did a large business, and his neatly engraved rifles became very popular. His f acton-

Take the associations and feelings which we form for familiar objects. A coin, a penknife, a jewel, or a pebble, which has long been carried in the pocket or worn by any one. seems to become imbued with his or her personality, and is really one kind oi fairy-lore or superstitions. Then there is a symbolism oi a higher, more patriotic or sacred impulse, and perhaps the full value of which we do not understand.
