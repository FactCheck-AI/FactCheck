The American Treasure Tour is proud to include the Music Box Society, Internationalâ€™s exclusive display of automatic music alongside our own nickelodeons, dance hall organs and the other rare and priceless pieces. Established in 1949, the M-B-S-I is an organization dedicated to preserving music boxes and other automatic music machines. They have chapters in all fifty states and in nineteen different countries, celebrating the beauty and artistry of hand-made machines that often date from before the electric age.
