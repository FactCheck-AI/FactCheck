The Symphionion Musikwerke Company of Leipzig, Germany began producing music machines in 1885, becoming one of the world’s first major producers of disc music boxes. Seeing the potential in the United States, the company established a production center in New Jersey, under the name Imperial Symphonion Manufacturing Company.
