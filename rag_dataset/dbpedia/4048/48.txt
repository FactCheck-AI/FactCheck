The town was founded in 1883 when settlers in Carnarvon drove 4000 sheep from York east of Perth seeking warmer agricultural land. Some of Australiaâ€™s largest sheep stations were set up and the jetty 1493m became the first port in Western Australia, and perhaps the world, to regularly export livestock.

Now, Carnarvon is situated approximately 904km north of Perth in Western Australia, on the west coast. This city offers an abundance of attractions such as the One Mile Jetty or the beautiful Blowholes but also some accommodation and exciting tourism products making Carnarvon a wonderful place for a truly memorable holiday.

Carnarvon is recognised for its banana plantations, tropical fruits, fine seafood, its warm and tropical climate and is situated on the mouth of the Gascoyne River where it enters the Indian Ocean. It is the largest town in the Gascoyne Region where tourists can discover the numerous sparkling beaches, brilliant displays of wildflowers and spectacular ocean blowholes.
