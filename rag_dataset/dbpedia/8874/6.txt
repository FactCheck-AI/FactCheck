Gilchrist County came together Friday night for Relay for Life of the Tri-Counties in Trenton, with a special guest. To open up the ceremony, Trenton native and famous country singer Easton Corbin gave a tribute to the fallen deputies. The relay started at 6:00 p.m. when Corbin sang the national anthem in their honor.

Trenton community members say it meant a lot for him to take time out of his tour to come back to his hometown.

"I mean, I'm a huge Easton Corbin fan, so yay!" said Paige Praet, a Trenton Middle High School student, and a Young Miss American Natural Beauty honoree. "I mean we hear him on the radio all the time like my grammy said, but it's just amazing to have him back in town."

Corbin met and took pictures with his fans after he sang. Then the Relay for Life event continued by honoring cancer survivors and caregivers with dinner and performances. Participants said it was the perfect way for the community to come together again after the tragedy.

"We live in a community where we all bond together," said Sherry Tiley, Trenton resident and cancer survivor. "Weâ€™re a small town community who support each other, and I feel like coming together today will also be a coming together of the officers, all our law enforcement, and their families."

The event continued with festivities like a luminaria, Zumba dancing, and haircuts to honor those affected by cancer.
