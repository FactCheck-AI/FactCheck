Inge Morath, the photographer wife of playwright Arthur Miller, died of lymphoma Jan. 30 in Manhattan, according to The New York Times.

Ms. Morath's photographs — posed shots, candids, celebrities, passersby, environments, interiors — appeared in a wide variety of international newspapers, magazines and publications over the years. She took a memorable shot of Miller and his then-wife Marilyn Monroe in 1960, The Times reported. Ms. Morath and Miller were married two years later.

According to the Magnum Photos website, Ms. Morath was born in Graz, Austria. Her parents were scientists and took her on their many European assignments. After studying languages in Berlin, she became a translator, then a journalist and the Austrian editor for Heute, an Information Service Branch publication based in Munich.

The photographer was a lifelong diary writer and letter writer. She wrote articles, as well, and became an editor at the Magnum Agency. She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953-54.

A world traveler, she was especially interested in the arts and world cultures. After her marriage to Miller, she settled in New York and Connecticut. She spoke Chinese and made a number of trips to China, where she photographed an array of subjects. Her photographs appear in the nonfiction account of the Chinese debut of Miller's play, Death of a Salesman, "Salesman in Beijing" (1984). Her selected published works include "Bring Forth the Children" (1960), "In Russia" (1969), "Inge Morath" (1975) "Country Life" (1977), "Chinese Encounters" (1979), "Portraits" (1986), "Russian Journal" (1991), "Inge Morath: Portraits" (1999), "Inge Morath: My Life as a Photographer" (1999).
