We are accepting applications for the Inge Morath Award, a grant given to a woman or nonbinary photographer under the age of 30 to support the completion of a long-term documentary project. The selected recipient will receive a grant of $7,500, and one finalist will also receive a $1,000 grant in support of their project.

The recipient and finalist are selected by a jury composed of Magnum Photos members, the Inge Morath Estate, and the Executive Director of the Magnum Foundation.

Inge Morath was an Austrian-born photographer who was associated with Magnum Photos for nearly fifty years. After her death in 2002, the Inge Morath Foundation was established with a limited-term mission to manage Morath’s estate and facilitate the study and appreciation of her contribution to photography. With the closure of the research space in 2014, Inge’s archive was acquired by the Beinecke Library at Yale University, and a set of Morath’s master prints by the Yale University Art Gallery, where they are now available to scholars.

Because Morath devoted much of her enthusiasm to encouraging women photographers, her colleagues at Magnum Photos established the Inge Morath Award in her honor. The award is administered by the Magnum Foundation as part of its mission to expand creativity and diversity in documentary photography, in cooperation with the Inge Morath Estate. For more about Morath’s enduring endurance and influence in a male-dominated industry, read Sumeja Tulic’s piece in the British Journal of Photography in honor of the award’s 20th anniversary.
