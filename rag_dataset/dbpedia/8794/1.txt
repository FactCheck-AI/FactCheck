Violet is named after the flower that bears its shade. Violet lies at the end of the visible light range and is parked between the wavelengths of invisible ultraviolet light and blue light. A combination of the stability and calmness of blue with the energy and passion of red, the color Violet represents royalty and luxury.

Violet pairs well together with its complementary color, yellow. You can include blues and greens to add depth to your illustration. The stronger blue hue in Violet also makes it a great color to add to oranges and pinks for contrast.
