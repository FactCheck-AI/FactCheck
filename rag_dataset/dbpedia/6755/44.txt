The Irish Arts Center (IAC) film series screens Jim Sheridanâ€™s classic film, In The Name Of The Father. Daniel Day Lewis portrays Gerry Conlon, purported ringleader of the Guildford Four, a group of three Irishmen and one English woman wrongly imprisoned for the 1974 IRA bombing of a pub in Guildford, England, that left five people dead. Emma Thompson stars as the lawyer who works tirelessly to gain their release in this searing, passionate film.
