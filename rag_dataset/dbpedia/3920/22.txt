A funeral service will be held at Hillside Memorial Park Thursday for Irving Brecher, a comedy writer who created the radio and TV series “The Life of Riley.”

Brecher, whose career in radio, television and the movies also included writing two Marx Brothers comedies and co-writing the Judy Garland musical “Meet Me in St. Louis,” died of age-related causes Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, his wife, Norma, told the Los Angeles Times.

Brecher wrote the screenplays for the Marx Brothers’ “At the Circus” (1939) and “Go West” (1940) and shared an Oscar nomination for the screenplay for “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944).

His other screenwriting credits include “Shadow of the Thin Man,” “Du Barry Was a Lady,” “Yolanda and the Thief,” “Cry for Happy” and !Bye Bye Birdie.”

Brecher also created, wrote and produced the radio series “The Life of Riley,” starring William Bendix, in the 1940s.

He wrote and directed a 1949 feature film version of “The Life of Riley,” and the show became an Emmy Award-winning TV series with Jackie Gleason as bumbling working-class everyman Chester A. Riley before Bendix took over.

Brecher was preceded in death by his first wife, Eve Bennett, and his two children, Joanna Giallelis and Keon Brecher, according to The Times. In addition to Norma, his wife of 25 years, he is survived by three stepchildren and eight grandchildren.

Thursday’s funeral is scheduled to start at 1 p.m.
