The 8th Doctor : Paul McGann (1997 - 2005) Books Only

From 1997, BBC Books published 74 books of the continuing adventures for the 8th Doctor. In 2005 a long awaited new series of Dr Who meant the end of the range, any further 8th Doctor stories being moved to the "Missing Adventures" range to make way for the 9th Doctor novels.

All of these are in my collection
