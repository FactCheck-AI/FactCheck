Following the major staff cuts at Cox Media Group yesterday, one of the company’s stations is on its way to a new format.

After stunting for six hours with a loop of five songs with “Rhythm” in the title, Cox Media Group flipped CHR “Hits 97.3” WFLC Miami to Rhythmic Hot AC keeping the “Hits” name and now positioning as “The Rhythm of Miami”.

Relaunching with 5000 songs commercial free, the new format debuted with DJ Sammy & Yanou “Heaven”, Marshmello/Jonas Brothers “Leave Before You Love Me”, Mary J. Blige “Real Love”, Harry Styles “Golden”, and Lana Del Rey x Cedric Gervias “Summertime Sadness (Remix)”

WFLC was one of three CHRs in Miami, registering a 2.6 share in the August 2021 Nielsen Audio ratings. That trailed iHeartMedia’s “Y100” WHYI’s 3.8 share, but was ahead of Audacy’s “Power 96” WPOW-FM’s 2.0.

KNOU-FM NOW 97.1 Flip to News/Talk

Audacy has announced it will flip CHR “97.1 Now” KNOU Los Angeles to News simulcasting 1070 KNX at 3pm today.

The move marks the second time this year that the company has revamped 97.1. The station dropped its “Amp Radio” KAMP branding in April to relaunch as “97.1 Now“. KNX joins its All-News sister stations in Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco simulcasting on full-powered FM signals. Only 950 WWJ Detroit and the duo of 880 WCBS and 1010 WINS New York remain AM only.

With the move to FM, KNX is removing the word “radio” from its brand in favor of “KNX News” to emphasize its multi-platform distribution.

KNX currently ranks tenth in the Los Angeles market with a 2.9 share. KNOU goes out tied for 28th place with a 1.4 share.

WPYO (Power 95.3)/Orlando Signing Off On Friday

COX MEDIA GROUP Top 40 WPYO (POWER 95.3)/ORLANDO, divested along with Alternative WSUN (97X)/TAMPA to SPANISH BROADCASTING SYSTEM (SBS) to comply with FCC ownership caps, has announced that THURSDAY (3/31) will be its last day on 95.3 FM. The station will continue as a commercial-free stream, “POWER ORLANDO,” but will cease broadcasting over the air.

An announcement on the stations' FACEBOOK page said, "POWER 95.3, as you know it, is coming to an end. What does this mean? Well, when you turn us on via ALEXA or GOOGLE play, or when you get into your car and turn the dial to 95.3, you currently hear us. Starting FRIDAY MORNING, that will no longer be the case. There will be no more POWER 95.3, there will on no more DANIE AND KEVIN MORNINGS, '5’ o clock Traffic Jam' etc. Long story short, another company has purchased the station, so what does this mean for us? Unfortunately, we’re all out of a job, and something else will be broadcast on 95.3. This is a business, and these sorts of things happen. The last day of POWER 95.3 programming will be this Thursday. However, you will be able to hear a commercial free version of POWER at POWER ORLANDO.com."

The post went on to say,"THIS IS NOT AN APRIL FOOL’S JOKE. This is really happening.We don’t know what’s next, but we thank you, and we love you, always… - @danieandkevin @itscjonair."

SBS has not announced what it will be airing on 95.3 once it takes over.

The station is promoting it will launch with a “massive playlist” of Hip Hip, R&B, Classic Hip-Hop, and Classic Soul in the spirit of an Adult Hits station under the oversight of VP/Operations & Programming Eddie Haskell and Program Director Anthony ‘Tone Hollywood’ Wheeler.

Wheeler joins WVHT from SummitMedia Adult R&B “107.3 Jamz” WJMZ Anderson/Greenville SC where he was most recently APD/MD/midday host. The Hampton VA native spent his entire career in Greenville at WJMZ and sister Rhythmic CHR “Hot 98.1” WHZT until departing last week.

The station’s first hour consisted of:

Stevie Wonder – Sir Duke

Nas ft. Lauryn Hill – If I Ruled The World

Luther Vandross – Never Too Much

Trey Songz – Can’t Help But Wait

Blackstreet – No Diggity

Aaliyah – Rock The Boat

Rick James – Super Freak

Soul For Real – Candy Rain

Nelly – Hot In Herre

Tom Tom Club – Genius of Love

Childish Gambino – Redbone

Brandy – Have You Ever

Sugarhill Gang – Rapper’s Delight

Al Green – Let’s Stay Together

The move also sees the departures of former WVHT PD/midday host Paul McCoy and afternoon host Alex Waters. McCoy programmed WVHT for its entire thirteen year run as a Top 40. Waters joined the station in 2019 from “Hits 96.5” WDOD-FM Chattanooga, where he recently began co-hosting the “Gluten Free Radio Show” as a night show for syndication with Calista Liew.

KISS-FM MOVES IN TRI-CITIES

Townsquare Media has moved its CHR “Kiss-FM” brand from 97.5 KOLW Basin City to newly acquired 105.3 KONA-FM Kennewick WA.

The move upgrades the brand from the 50kW Class C1 signal to KONA-FM’s 100kW Class C signal as it replaces Cherry Creek Media’s former AC “Mix 105.3” brand. “105.3 Kiss-FM” continues to feature The Jubal Show in mornings, WJLK Asbury Park NJ’s Matt Ryan in middays, Brand Manager Dan Roberts in afternoons, and PopCrush Nights in evenings.

In the Fall 2021 Eastlan Ratings, “Kiss-FM” was fourth in the Kennewick/Richland/Pasco market with a 6.6 share, but trailed Stephens Media Group’s competing CHR “Power 99.1” KUJ-FM’s second ranked 8.0 share. KONA-FM was tenth with a 4.5 share.

As KOLW moves into the Allen N. Blum led Tri-Cities Divestiture Trust, it has flipped to Classic Hits as “97.5 Kool-FM” resurrecting the format and branding heard on the station from 2004 to 2013. It becomes the second Classic Hits station to launch in the market in as many weeks following Stephens Media Group’s launch of “Big 95.7” KKSR Walla Walla/Kennewick on June 17.

WNOW-FM CHR TO URBAN

HOT 96.3 INDIANAPOLIS MAKES ITS MOVE TO 100.9

The format move brought on by Radio One’s upcoming acquisition of Emmis’ Indianapolis properties has begun.

Hip Hop “Hot 96.3” WHHH Indianapolis began simulcasting on 100.9 WNOW-FM Speedway at midnight as it prepares to shift its audience ahead of its permanent move. The move marks the end of the 22 year old CHR “Radio Now” brand. Radio Now debuted on Emmis’ 93.1 in October 2000. Following the move of News/Talk WIBC from 1070 to 93.1 in 2007, Radio One acquired the station’s IP and immediately relaunched it on 100.9.

Radio One is divesting 96.3 WHHH to Bible Broadcasting, which will launch their Christian Preaching network under new WYHX call letters upon the closing of the Radio One/Emmis deal. The WHHH calls will move to 100.9 with the “Hot” brand.

WHHH currently ranks twelfth in the Indianapolis with a 2.5 share. WNOW-FM goes out with a 1.7 share in the July 2022 Nielsen Audio ratings.

97.1 KISS-FM BILLINGS GETS MIXED

Townsquare Media flipped CHR “97.1 Kiss-FM” KKBR Billings MT to Hot AC “Mix 97.1” on Friday afternoon.

Now positioning as “Billings’ Best Mix of 2K to Today”, the move shifts KKBR from directly competing with Radio Billings’ CHR “Hot 101.9” KRSQ to Desert Mountain Broadcasting Hot AC “Planet 106.7” KPLN. In the July 2022 Eastlan ratings, KKBR was third in the market with a 9.5 share, while KRSQ was second with a 15.0 and KPLN was ninth with a 3.6 share.

With the flip, KKBR has replaced the syndicated Brooke & Jeffrey show in mornings with a locally originating show hosted by Michael Foth and Nikki Vega. Foth has been with Townsquare Billings since 2019 as PD/afternoon host at Classic Rock “103.7 The Hawk” KMHK, and has previously worked at KRSQ, KPLN, and Rock “96.3 The Zone” KRZN in the market. He has also programmed “94.9 The Blaze” KHTB Salt Lake City. Vega previously hosted nights for Westwood One’s Country network as Nikki Walker from 2017 until January 2022.

The remainder of the new “Mix 97.1” lineup will feature WPST Trenton NJ afternoon host Austyn in middays, WJLK Asbury Park NJ midday host Nicole Murray in afternoons, while switching from the CHR to Hot AC version of Townsquare’s “Pop Crush Nights” in evenings.

Original Report 8/29: Changes appear to be amidst at Townsquare Media CHR “97.1 Kiss-FM” KKBR Billings MT.

KKBR’s social media pages (which feature an Under Construction banner) have begun teasing the recruitment of “The Big J Show”, which has anchored mornings on Radio Billings’ “Hot 101.9” KRSQ Laurel MT for the past two decades.

Luminate and Mediabase Announce New Airplay Monitoring Partnership

Luminate has announced a new partnership with airplay monitoring service Mediabase. Effective December 2022, Mediabase’s radio tracking data will fuel Luminate’s reporting on radio’s music activity in the U.S. and Canada. This essentially merges Mediabase and BDS Radio into one monitoring system, with all BDS subscribers being transferred to Mediabase.

Along with today’s announcement, Luminate also officially revealed plans for a new, modernized client and user platform, which will house all of the company’s data offerings. Mediabase is the first of many new data partners that will contribute intelligence to the new Luminate platform, which is slated for launch in 2023.

Luminate CEO Rob Jonas said, “Mediabase has proven itself to be the most trusted and referenced radio data provider in today’s fast-moving, ever-changing music industry. At Luminate, we pride ourselves in being able to provide our clients – whether they be major record labels, tech companies, film studios, TV networks or indie music powerhouses – with the absolute best information they need to operate and grow their businesses. This new partnership allows us to do just that.”

Philippe Generali, President/CEO of Mediabase, added, “This new strategic partnership allows us the opportunity to be innovative in our approach to radio monitoring and to further ours and Luminate’s positions as undisputed experts in music data.”

Currently, Luminate, formerly known as P-MRC Data, and before that Nielsen Music, owns and operates the radio tracking service BDS, which is used to service its clients’ radio data needs, including powering Billboard’s radio charts and other charts incorporating radio data, including the Billboard Hot 100. The company will be transitioning from BDS to Mediabase over the coming months in preparation for the new arrangement, which will take effect by year’s end.

The company notes that “there will be no disruption in radio services provided by Luminate during the transition period.” Additionally, Luminate is also currently expanding operations in its New York, Los Angeles and Tampa offices and continues to add to its global team.

BDSRADIO MONITORING TO BE FOLDED INTO MEDIABASE

BDSradio subscribers were notified early this morning that the service will shut down on November 1 with all subscribers transferred to the iHeartMedia owned RCS’ Mediabase.

The MRC and Penske Media owned Luminate (formerly MRC Data and P-MRC), which has operated BDSradio since it acquired it Nielsen’s music data business in late 2019, states that “Effective November 1, 2022, Mediabase’s radio tracking data will fuel Luminate’s reporting on radio’s music activity in the U.S. and Canada and BDSradio will be retired.”

The note continues, “As a current BDSradio customer, your account will be moved to MediaBase. A MediaBase rep will be contacting you to give you access to the complete MediaBase Radio Play dataset via their platform for the remainder of your BDSradio contract. Additionally, you will also have access to Metro Streaming/Airplay in Luminate Music Connect where you can continue to compare airplay and streaming data side by side.”

The public FAQ sheet for the deal notes that it is not a merger of the two brands, but “a partnership to provide mutual clients with the best data and product offerings possible”. It does not provide information on whether stations which are monitored by BDSradio, but not Mediabase will be added noting that the stations should reach out to Mediabase for information.

Luminate states that it will continue to integrate radio airplay into its broader music consumption offerings with details on specific products and features in the near future. It also notes that the Billboard charts will continue to utilize different panels than Mediabase’s charts, however there may be an adjustment period within Billboard based on the stations that are currently monitored.

WAVE CRASHES INTO EASTERN NC

Curtis Media Group has flipped CHR “The Hot FM” 99.5 WXNR Grifton/New Bern and 97.5 W248BS Jacksonville NC to Hot AC “99.5/97.5 The Wave“.

New WMJV call letters took effect at the end of September ahead of the change, which was first indicated in our 9/16 Domain Insight report.

The station will utilize programming from Westwood One’s 24/7 Hot AC feed including The Bert Show in mornings, Jay Cruze in middays, Kelsie Paige in afternoons, and Elliot & Nina at night. The flip moves the station from being a younger skewing competitor to Dick Broadcasting CHR “Bob 93.3” WERO to attacking the station from the opposite side. While Curtis Media does not subscribe to Nielsen’s monthly ratings in the market, WERO had a 5.5 share in the August 2022 ratings.

Are further changes on the way in the Greenville/New Bern/Jacksonville market?

WXNR-FM Move To Top 40 Activator Panel

Post by ChartReporter on

Cumulus Media has flipped CHR “Hot 93.3” KLIF-FM Haltom City/Dallas to 90s/2000s hits.

Positioning as “DFW’s 90s & 2000s”, the move takes KLIF-FM out of direct format competition with iHeartMedia’s “106.1 Kiss-FM” KHKS and closer to Hot AC “102.9 Now” KDMX. The move has the station emphasizing music from the 1990s through 2010s with a handful of currents and recurrents remaining.

KLIF-FM had fallen below a one share in recent months registering a 0.8 in the last two Nielsen Audio ratings monthlies. KHKS currently ranks sixth in the market with a 4.3 share.

The 6am hour n the revamped Hot 93.3 featured:

Fergie – Big Girls Don’t Cry

Kid Laroi & Justin Bieber – Stay

Fun – We Are Young

Mariah Carey – Fantasy

No Doubt – Sunday Morning

50 Cent – Candy Shop

Vengaboys – We Like To Party

Nickelback – How You Remind Me

Fugees – Ready Or Not

Billie Eilish – Bad Guy

CURTIS MEDIA SHUFFLES MULTIPLE RALEIGH/DURHAM FORMATS

Curtis Media has realigned its frequencies at multiple stations in the Raliegh/Durham market.

The biggest move was upgrading the Classic Hits format of “Kix 102.9” WKIX-FM Raleigh to a trimulcast branded as just “Kix 102“. Recently acquired 102.3 WKJO Smithfield will expand WKIX-FM’s coverage to the southeast of Raleigh. 102.5 WPLW-FM Hillsborough drops its CHR “Pulse-FM” format to expand the Kix format’s coverage in areas around Durham and Chapel Hill.

“Pulse-FM” will continue to be heard on 96.9 WWPL Goldsboro while adding 104.7 W284CP Raleigh and 104.7 W284CD Youngsville to provide better coverage within Raleigh itself, while the loss of WPLW-FM takes the station’s coverage away from Durham and the western half of the market.

The two 104.7 translators had been rebroadcasting Oldies 850 WKIX Raleigh. That brand now becomes “Oldies 93.5” adding 93.5 W228CZ Cary.

Despite the Class A signal that only covered part of the market, WKIX-FM ranked fifth in the November 2022 Nielsen Audio ratings with a 5.1 share. WWPL/WPLW-FM were seventeenth with a 2.0 share, while 850 WKIX was right above it with a 2.1.
