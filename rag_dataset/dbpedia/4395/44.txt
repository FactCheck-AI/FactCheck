History

WFBC-FM signed on in May 12, 1947 as a sister station to WFBC-AM, owned by The Roger Peace family who also owned the Greenville News/Piedmont. The programming was 90% simulcast for the first 8 to 10 years featuring block local programming and NBC Network programs. The early management team included people like: Bevo Whitmire, Ken Beechboard, R. A. Jolly and Bruce Buchanan. During the late 40's and early 50's, WFBC-FM featured the Esso Reporter each 30 minutes during the morning hours with Norvin Duncan as host. Other early morning shows; Housekeeping-a-hobby with Alice Wyman, Kitchen Klatter with Claude Freeman and The "Aristocratic Pigs" with Baby Ray. WFBC-FM's later morning shows featured "Shelley's Shenanigans" with Bob Shelley (1953-1956), Bob Poole and "Pooles Party Line" (1957- 1961). In 1962, Monty Dupuy became the long running host of the simulcast morning show which was one of the most popular shows in Greenville Radio History garnering more than 50% of the audience for more than 15 years. Dupuy was the morning host on WFBC-FM from 1962 to 1977. In 1965, WFBC-FM began independent programming of "light music" and "Music with McMasters" only simulcasting during the Dupuy morning show and special events. WFBC-FM started programming Drake Chenaults (Hit Parade) format in early 1971 becoming one of the most popular radio stations in the upstate. Past personalities during the 60's and 70's on WFBC-FM include: Norvin Duncan, Johnny Wright, Bob Poole, Bob Shelley, Monty Dupuy, Stowe Hoyle, Ben Greer, Bill Kregar, Verner Tate, Alice Wyman, Claude Freeman, Wilfred Walker, Billy Powell, Lee Kanipe, Max Mace, Jeff Fields, Ray Clune, Johnny Batson, Andy Scott, Ken Rogers, Dan Kelly, Jerry Haynes, Jim Burnside, Eston Johnson, Scott Shannon, Dale Gilbert, Dave Partridge, Jim Phillips, etc. WFBC-FM was an adult contemporary station during the 70's, 80s, and an oldies station in the early 1990s, with the name "Oldies 93.7". When the switch to the current format was made, the station stunted by having a disc jockey read the phone book. Someone called the station to complain about his name being mispronounced.Fact|date=June 2007 In April 1995, the station changed to a CHR format.

The call letters WFBC were taken from a station in Knoxville, Tennessee that had gone off the air in the early 1930's and reassigned to Greenville. Former WFBC program director (in 1937) Norvin Duncan said that W.F.B.C. stood for First Baptist Church.Three other stations in the Greenville market had used the WFBC call sign: The original AM station owned by the Peace family, owners of the "Greenville News" and "Greenville Piedmont", and broadcasting on 1330 kHz, now WYRD; television channel 4, signed on by the family in 1953, which used the calls until 1983 (when it became WYFF); and TV channel 40 in Anderson, which changed its calls to WFBC from WAXA after an ownership change. The WFBC call sign was used on channel 40 until 1999; it is now WMYA-TV.
