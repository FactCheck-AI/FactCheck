Alsace-Lorraine, officially the Republic of Alsace-Lorraine is a landlocked country located in Western and Central Europe. It is bordered by Switzerland to the south, France to the west, Germany to the east and Wallonia-Luxemburg to the north.

Historically, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine became a land of competition between the germans and the french, passing through the control of both, until its independence right after the Fourth Great War, on June 21, 1946.

Thanks to the influence of its neighbours, Alsace-Lorraine is a multicultural country, with both German and French as the main languages, spoken countrywide and taught in schools.
