I’ve been practicing the art and craft of journalism in Southern California for the better part of two decades. Most recently I was the editor of Voice of OC, a nonprofit news organization based in Orange County. I helped found the organization in 2009 and under my stewardship the newsroom established itself as the preeminent source for accountability journalism in Orange County.

Prior to joining Voice of OC, I was a senior reporter and assistant editor for Voice of San Diego, one of the most successful independent, nonprofit local news websites in the nation. My time at VOSD included stints covering San Diego City Hall and the local scientific community. I was also the lead editor of an award-winning investigation into a charter school administrator.

Before becoming a nonprofit journalist, I spent eight years as an enterprise and investigative reporter for The San Diego Union-Tribune. My work at the U-T included award-winning stories on financial elder abuse, lack of oversight of contractors in Iraq, San Diego’s high rate officer-involved shootings and mismanagement at the San Diego Red Cross.

Early in my career I worked as a reporter at the Allentown (Pa.) Morning Call and as a researcher for Dateline NBC. I have a bachelor’s degree from the University of Missouri School of Journalism, and I’m inching toward a master’s in film and new media.
