Deadstring Brothers were an alt-country/rock band from Detroit, Michigan fronted by guitarist/vocalist Kurt Marschke.

The Deadstring Brothers artist page on Bloodshot Records website lists the status of the band as no longer on tour, stating "The brutal and indifferent whims of the world drove these guys out of the business. It is to all our losses."[7] In 2018, Bloodshot Records released a digital-only compilation titled Best of... Deadstring Brothers[8].
