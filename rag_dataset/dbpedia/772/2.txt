John D. Richardson, RICP, LACP, has received the 2023 President’s Citation from the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (NAIFA) for his extraordinary service to the association.

The NAIFA President’s Citation recognizes an association member who exemplifies NAIFA leadership and has gone above and beyond in their support for NAIFA and the industry. NAIFA’s 2023 President Bryon Holz selected Richardson to receive the President’s Citation to acknowledge his exemplary work in political advocacy and membership recruitment. The award was presented at NAIFA’s National Leadership Conference in Washington, D.C., in December.

“It’s my honor to recognize a NAIFA member who especially exemplifies NAIFA leadership,” Holz said. “John, affectionately known to his friends as JDR, is best known for his passionate, thoughtful, dedicated servant leadership. I cannot think of anyone more deserving of the NAIFA President’s Citation.”

He has been a member of NAIFA’s Young Advisor Team (YAT) Working Group and is a past recipient of NAIFA’s YAT Leader of the Year award. He served on the 2023 NAIFA-Tennessee Board of Directors, where he was IFAPAC Co-Chair. He was the President of NAIFA-Nashville in 2012 and of the state association in 2019.
