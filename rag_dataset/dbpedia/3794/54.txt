Notes:

* Augustine and Mary Ball Washington are the parents of George Washington, the first President of the United States of America. Mary was the second wife of Augustine and helped him raise his eldest children.

* Augustine first married Jane Butler (1694-1729), an orphan, in 1715. The couple had four children, only two lived to adulthood. Butler, an infant, died in 1716; Lawrence (1718-1752) renamed the family home 'Mount Vernon', Augustine II (1720-1762) was to inherit Mount Vernon - if he would give his own estate to George, and Jane (1722-1735) who died during an epileptic seizure.

* Augustine Washington died from "gout of the stomach" on April 12, 1743, at approximately 49 years of age, in King George County, Virginia.

* Mary Ball Washington may have died from breast cancer, but there is no proof. She was buried, as she desired, on the Fielding Lewis plantation, near "meditation rock" that was close to the Lewis Fielding home. Tradition has it that this was her favorite retreat for reading, prayer, and meditation. Her mother's maiden name and family are unknown at this time.
