A warm welcome from the Headteacher

West Ham Church School, founded in 1723, is a Voluntary Controlled Church of England School in the London Borough of Newham and the Diocese of Chelmsford.

The school has a strong Christian ethos but also celebrates the many cultures and backgrounds from which the children, families and staff have come.

Children matter at West Ham Church School and pupil voice is strong through the School Council and through the more direct means of an open door policy. Children are always free to speak of what is troubling them so we are then able to best deal with their concerns and their requests. We work to provide a happy, safe and stimulating environment.

I believe that parents and carers have a crucial role to play in their children’s education as children learn best when parents are fully involved in their children’s learning and when they work successfully in partnership with the school. As a school we strive to build and improve on these links with the many events that are held such as, parents’ meetings, class visits, parents’ courses and open days.

Our aim is to truly work to create an education system that enables each child to achieve his/her full potential.

Children participate in a wide range of extra-curricular activities both inside and outside of school to broaden their experiences, education and curriculum and also to allow them to make a positive contribution to the life of the school and to the community.

I hope that you enjoy viewing our website and that you get a feel of what we are like as a school. If you are a prospective parent and you are interested in visiting to meet staff and children, please contact the school office.
