A new artist's exhibition has arrived at the Jody Klotz Fine Art gallery in downtown Abilene.

"Alice Baber: Colors of the Rainbow" is open and is the galleryâ€™s first solo exhibition of Baber, according to a recent gallery press release.

Baber "counts among female Abstract Expressionist artists who were marginalized by art history and the societal mores of their day, who are now being rediscovered with vigor by the art world," according to Jody Klotz.

Klotz also said that her sublimely colorful work is "increasingly sought after by collectors internationally."

Humble beginnings of a world-class artist

Alice Baber was born in rural Illinois in 1928 and ended up a world traveler in later years. She spent half of her years in Paris and the other half traveling the globe until her death in 1982.

Baber's exhibition at Jody Klotz Fine Art features abstract oil paintings and works on paper, according to the gallery. These works offer a look into her artistic evolution, as well as her broad use of color and form.

Baber's works are world-renowned. Baber has permanent collections at such museums as the Museum of ModernArt, the Guggenheim and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City alone.

Jody Klotz Fine Art is open 9 a.m.-5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and by appointment.
