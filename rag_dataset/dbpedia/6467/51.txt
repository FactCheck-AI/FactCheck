Why a Monarchy?

High living standards

Most contemporary European Monarchies have high living standards and are generally good countries to live in and more democratic than most Republics.

Political stability

As there are no elections to worry about, the Head of State does not have to worry about the end of his term after 5 years and can look at the bigger picture.

Anointed by God

Monarchy and the Church are since the time of St. Volodymyr the Great related. The Monarchy of Kyivan Rusâ€™ have since 987 supporting the Christian religion.

Rus' culture

The Monarchy is a national symbol, as much as other parts are. In this way the Monarchy is as much part of the Ukrainian culture as the Tryzub.

Impartiality

No politician is liked by the entire nation. The Monarch is above ideology, and as such can be an impartial mediator and a symbol of unity.
