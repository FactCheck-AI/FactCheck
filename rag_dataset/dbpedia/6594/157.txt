Massie/Joyce/Purcell/App take first-place at Lake Forest.

LOUISVILLE, KY (October 5, 2023) – After battling rainy weather a majority of the day, victory at the final pro-am of the Kentucky PGA’s 2023 tournament season belongs to Jesse Massie, PGA, Director of Instruction at Woodhaven Country Club, and his team - Trae Joyce, Kevin Purcell and Alex App.

The triumphant foursome won by one stroke at Lake Forest Country Club. The teams competed in a shamble format with the two best net scores used on every hole to determine the results. The winning team fielded under-par scores on a majority of the holes, with the net format helping add six eagles to their card en route to shooting a 24-under total.

The day also included low pro and low senior pro competitions. Blake Watts, PGA, and Sara Stephens, PGA, tied at the top of the low pro leaderboard after rounds of 3-under 69 that included a combined seven birdies and an eagle from Stephens on hole 2. Steve Cox, PGA, claimed the low senior pro honors by five with a round of 2-under 70. Cox fired six birdies, with three in a row on holes 6, 7 and 8.

Finally, the tournament saw a closest-to-the-pin contest on the 13th hole with proceeds benefitting the PGA HOPE Kentucky chapters. Congratulations to Bob Bender for sticking it to 4'3" to win and thank you to all who participated!
