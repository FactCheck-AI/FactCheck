We're in for an Easter treat with the BBC's latest adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel, Jamaica Inn.

Downton Abbey's Jessica Brown-Findlay stars as the heroine, Mary, in the gothic drama set on the windswept Cornish moors in 1821. Mary is forced to move into Jamaica Inn with her aunt Patience after her mother dies. But her aunt is under the spell of her brutal husband, Joss, and Mary soon discovers Jamaica Inn is the centre of a smuggling ring.

The three-part series airs over consecutive nights and also stars Joanne Whalley, Shirley Henderson, Sean Harris and Matthew McNulty.

Jamaica Inn is on BBC One on Monday 21, Tuesday 22 and Wednesday 23 April at 9pm.
