Rimbaud is a collaboration between three singular voices on the Polish scene: 80s punk-legend vocalist Tomasz Budzyński, member of such bands as Armia and Siekiera; the equally legendary sax player Mikołaj Trzaska, a figurehead on the Polish avant-garde scene; and well established electronic artist Michał Jacaszek, known internationally for his spiritual electroacoustic music. As Rimbaud, they interpret the poet’s texts in a truly unique way, combining forces as a slow-rolling, heavy jazz/noise outifit. Their brutal, densely textured sound was captured on an excellent self-titled album released earlier this year on Gustaff Records.
