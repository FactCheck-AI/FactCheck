When is Osmeña Day?

In honor of the late Governor of Cebu and the 4th President of the Republic of the Philippines, Sergio Osmeña, Sr., September 9th is Osmeña Day, considered a Special non-working holiday in the whole province of Cebu and its component cities.

It was made official through the declaration of Republic Act 6953 in May 1990.

The Grand Old Man of Cebu, Sergio Osmeña, was born on September 9th 1878.

On the death of President Manuel Quezon in 1943, Osmeña succeeded to the presidency and took his oath of office on the same day before Associate Justice Robert H. Jackson of the United States Supreme Court. As the new head of the Philippine Commonwealth-in-exile, Osmeña was invited to be with Gen. MacArthur during the landing at Leyte.

When the liberation campaign came to an end, after the unconditional surrender of Japan, Osmeña faced a formidable job of reconstruction with all the energy, wisdom and dedication of which he was capable.

Osmeña was defeated by Manuel Roxas in the elections held on April 23, 1946.

Osmeña then retired to his home in Cebu, where he spent the remaining years of his life until his death on October 19th 1961.
