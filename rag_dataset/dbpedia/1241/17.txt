Le Fantastique Bazar

Le Fantastique Bazar is a project that was built by listening to associations and their issues: we support them in their projects of digitization, structuring of databases, recruitment of volunteers, animation of community... and so on! Le Fantastique Bazar is a versatile, dynamic and accessible team which, by vocation, puts all its entrepreneurial qualities at the service of associations and their fight, which accompanies their growth and helps them improve their impact. Le Fantastique Bazar is also a "tailor-made" support program offered to associations at all stages of their growth: from the diagnosis of their problems (strategic, organizational and digital), to the implementation of the appropriate tools. to solve them. We work daily with associations of all sizes and all types of activity: Makesense, Between the Lines, Refugees Food Festival, Les Talents d'Alphonse, Epidemium, etc. Contact us > [email protected] Website >fantastiquebazar.com
