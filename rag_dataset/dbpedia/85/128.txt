CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The National Weather Service in Cleveland has issued a lake effect snow warning for Cuyahoga, Geauga, Lake and Ashtabula counties in effect from 10 p.m. Wednesday to 6 p.m. Saturday.

Total snow accumulation through Saturday is expected to be between 6 to 12 inches, with higher amounts in areas hit hardest by lake effect snow or at higher altitudes, according to NWS.

Rain will transition to lake effect snow Wednesday evening, with an accumulation of about 3 to 5 inches. Another round of lake effect snow is expected to roll into the area mid-morning Thursday through Thursday night, and again on Friday night into Saturday, NWS said.

Winds may gust as high as 50 mph Thursday and cause blowing and drifting snow. Wind chill temperatures will be in the single-digits through Saturday morning, NWS said.

Travel could be hazardous, and the weather could impact morning and evening commutes, NWS said. High winds may reduce visibility and could bring down tree branches.

A gale warning is also in effect from 7 a.m. Thursday to 7 a.m. Friday for parts of central and eastern Lake Erie. Expect west winds of 30 to 40 knots with gusts up to 45 knots, and 8- to 13-foot waves, NWS said.
