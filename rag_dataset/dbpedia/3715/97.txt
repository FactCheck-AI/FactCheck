Number one again

With her new album »Music«, released on March 9, young singer Mika Nakashima has maintained her status as one of the top artists of Sony Music Japan. Like her first two albums »True« and »Love« her new album stormed to the top of the japanese album charts.

On »Music« Sony Music Japan and Mika Nakashima stuck with the succesful recipe of the first two albums. »Music« contains primarily slow and mid-tempo pop songs with excursions into R&B, Jazz and Reggae.

People who bought last year's five single releases »Seven«, »Sakurairo maukoro«, »Oborodukiyo-Inori«, »Hinotori« and »Legend« already own more than half of the songs on »Music« (seven out of 13). But the six new tracks, with the slow songs »Kumo no ito« and »Hitori« as well as »Hemlock« (R&B track with a late 70's appeal) as highlights, make this album worth buying.
