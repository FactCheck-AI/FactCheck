Young Japanese starlet Mika Nakashima releases her second compilation album of popular hits, showcasing her talents for a number of different genres.

Nakashima blasted onto the music scene eight years ago and has accomplished a lot in that time, from releasing albums that shot to number one and starring in the Nana films, to performing in a New Orleans charity tribute show.

Nakashima's newest release is compilation album No More Rules that comes with a 15-track CD and a bonus DVD featuring 11 music videos. As well as new song Game, the CD features the jazzy songs Love Addict, Venus in the Dark and Fake, rock numbers Isolation and I Don't Know, and pop songs Seven and It's Too Late.

Disturbingly, 15 ads for Kanebo Kate Cosmetics have been included on the DVD. And unfortunately, this is what this album is really about. The compilation only features tracks that have been used in ads for the cosmetics company. What's even worse is that the album name is also the company's slogan. Then again, if an artist is going to sell out, she might as well go all the way.

If you already own Nakashima's previous albums, give this compilation a miss. But if you don't, as much of a sell-out as this is, she is a great singer, and this is a fantastic collection of her hits.
