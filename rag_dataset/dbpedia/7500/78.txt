One of the seven colours that sits between arancione (orange) and verde (green) on the spectrum is giallo (yellow). It is also one of the three primary colours along with rosso (red) and blu (blue).

It comes from the Latin word galbĭnus which means greenish-yellow or yellowish.

When used as an adjective, the ending changes according to the gender and number of the subject.

In Italian, the colour isn’t the only thing the word giallo denotes. It is also the word for any film or novel with an exciting and mysterious plot, typically involving crime or espionage. A few possible translations in English include thriller, crime novel or detective story.

By extension, it can also refer to real life events shrouded in mystery.
