Silas Lillard Bryan, of Scots-Irish and English descent, was an avid Jacksonian Democrat. Silas won election to the Illinois State Senate in 1852 and again in 1856, but was defeated for re-election in 1860. He did win election as a state circuit judge for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, and moved to a 520-acre (210.4 ha) farm north of Salem in 1866, living in a ten-room house that was the envy of Marion County. He retained his position on the bench through 1873.
