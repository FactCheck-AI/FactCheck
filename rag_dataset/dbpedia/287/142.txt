Billed as the first sustainable high-rise in Boston, the Atlantic Wharf complex is a new addition to the Boston skyline, built upon a historic base of turn-of-the-century buildings. Using several existing structures to serve as the podium of the tower minimized building materials and construction time. The new addition blends in with the existing urban fabric and creates a dynamic pedestrian experience. The entry to the tower is through a slender crystalline atrium placed between two of the historic base buildings.

The mixed-use tower comprises residential, office, and retail spaces which bring a variety of amenities to the community, including one of Bostonâ€™s few waterfront restaurants. The overall design reflects its nautical surroundings, with structural references to masts and the cladding alluding to sails. The building is also LEED Platinum-certified (Core & Shell), utilizing rainwater harvesting and a 1,670 square meter green roof on top of the podium. It is estimated to use 42% less energy and 69% less domestic water than a comparable building.
