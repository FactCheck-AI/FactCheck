Sampson Jack

2014-15 to 2016-17 Forward

NC League 49(15)6 Cups 8(3)2

Debut 28 March 2015 sub Bristol Rovers (Home)

A member of the Wigan Academy from 2006 to 2008 and the youth section at Bolton Wanderers from 2008 to 2011, Jack signed his first professional contract with Bolton in August 2011. Although he made no senior appearances for Bolton, he spent time on loan at Southend United from January to April 2012 (nine league appearances), where he made his Football League debut, and then Accrington Stanley from October to November 2012 (five appearances). Jack moved to Morecambe in June 2013 (58 appearances, five goals).

Whilst at Morecambe signed a loan deal with Macclesfield Town from March to May 2015, signing permanently for the Silkmen in July 2015. Brought in to give manager John Askey an alternative option in the forward line at a time when the recognised forwards had not featured on the score sheet for several matches. Jack's two goals came in the 2-2 draw at Halifax at the beginning of April.

During the 2015-16 season Jack featured in the majority of the matches in different roles: as sole striker in a 4-5-1 formation, in a double strike force in a 4-4-2 formation and for several matches on the left wing. Whilst only scoring four goals, all in the second half of the season, he brought other skills to his game by using his physical presence and held the ball up well. In the home match against Dover Athletic on 12 April 2016 when goalkeeper Richie Branagan was dismissed, Jack took over the gloves for the majority of the match keeping a clean sheet and was Man of the Match in recognition of his excellent performance.

Involved in the majority of matches in the first half of the 2016-17 season Jack was used both as a striker and in a wide left midfield position and scored three goals. With manager John Askey preferring a sole striker (filled by Chris Holroyd) in his formation and other players available capable of filling the left midfield position, in January 2017 Jack went out on loan to Chorley (16 appearances six goals) until the end of the 2016-17 season.

Released by Macclesfield in the summer of 2017, Jack signed for Southport where he was the Supporters' Player of the Year in 2017-18 and Manager's Player of the Year in 2018-19. Moved to AFC Fylde in October 2020 for an undisclosed fee on a one-year contract with the option of a further year at the club's behest. AFC Fylde exercised the one-year extension to Jack's contract for the 2021-22 season. Returned to Chorley in February 2022 on a permanent contract which was extended to the end of the 2022-23 season in the summer of 2022.

Signed for Macclesfield Town in the summer of 2005, Kevin immediately went into the starting line-up, but after a rather uncertain time he was rested. However, when he was re-instated in November he returned a much more determined player and was virtually ever present for the remainder of the 2005-06 season at left-back or left wing-back. He took many of Macclesfieldâs free-kicks from which he scored three goals and also netted two goals from open play, one of which, much to his delight as a left-footed player, was scored with his right foot.

Having been transfer listed during the 2005-06 season, Kevin moved to Chester City in July 2006 (54 appearances, three goals). Subsequently has played for Weymouth from July 2008 (30 appearances), Oxford United from February 2009

Having been released by Buxton he played one match for AFC Wulfrunians in 2014 after which he retired from playing football.

In January 2018 Kevin, along with Jamie Haynes, were appointed as the new management team at Ellesmere Rangers (West Midlands League Premier Division).

He could not establish himself in the senior side only making one league appearance and asked for a transfer during his second season at the club which resulted in him spending two months on loan at Wigan Athletic. Roy Chapman, manager of Stafford Rangers, spotted him with Ben signing for Stafford in March 1974. In his first full season he was involved in their magnificent run of 12 matches in the FA Cup and gained a FA Trophy winners' medal in 1979.

Ben then signed for Macclesfield Town in the summer of 1982 where he was a tower of strength in the back line and scored two goals on two occasions: firstly, in the 4-3 away win at Gainsborough Trinity early in the season and, secondly in the 3-1 win in the Cheshire Senior Cup Semi-final against Witton Albion in 1983 and went on to gain a winners' medal in the final.

Debut 21 March 1998 Shrewsbury Town (Home)

Wanting to complete his secondary education, Ben initially refused an apprenticeship at Barry Fryâs Birmingham City, but continued to play for their Youth team and made five appearances for England Schoolboys. Eventually he accepted an apprenticeship with Birmingham where he signed his first professional contract in May 1993, although it was at Northampton Town whilst on loan that he made his Football League debut at the age of 19 in his sole appearance.

Despite always playing with enthusiasm, having a good turn of pace and adept at finding space, Ben found it difficult to command a regular place. However, in his final season at the club, he received his just rewards and was virtually ever present in his accustomed role as a right-sided central midfielder, and even took over in goal when Tony Bullock was dismissed at Southend. Always adopting an attacking stance, Ben scored some important goals, including one against Bolton in the Worthington Cup victory. Whilst at Macclesfield Ben gained a winners' medal in the Cheshire Senior Cup in 2000.

Ben was appointed Chief Executive officer and Head of Commercial Development and Events, World Corporate Games in July 2010, a position he held until moving to MM Flowers, based in Cambridgeshire, as Head of Commercial in May 2018.

Seed Rev W

1880-81 to 1882-83 Forward

Debut - unknown due to missing match information

From the information available appeared fairly regularly in the 1880-81 season, a single match in the 1881-82 season and only in the opening matches of the 1882-83 season. Perhaps his lack of appearances may be due to the fact that on occasions he acted as a referee, including the final of the Macclesfield Association Silver Medal Competition in April 1882 against the Baptists. A Curate at St George's Church he is said to have been a fine footballer confirmed in his first match for the club when he scored a hat-trick in the 6-0 home win against Cocknage. He also scored a brace against the Bolton side Eagley in January 1881. Represented Cheshire at County level.

Simpson Gary

2009-10 to 2011-12 Manager

Matches 111, Won 33, Drawn 47, Lost 31, %Win 29.72

Started his career as a midfielder at Stoke City where he made over 100 appearances for the reserve team. However, the rest of his playing career came at non-league level. First at Boston United (1980-85), then Stafford Rangers (1985-86), Weymouth (1986-87), Stafford Rangers (1986-87), Boston United (1988-90), Altrincham (1989-91), Gainsborough (player/manager 1991-93), Arnold Town (1993-94) and Hyde United (1994-95). He won nine England semi-professional caps and also captained the Middlesex Wanderers touring side playing games in Indonesia, Holland and Hungary.

On retiring from playing, Simpson teamed up with Keith Alexander, who he first met when they were both players at Boston United, acting as assistant at Ilkeston Town (1996-2000), Northwich Victoria (2000-01), Lincoln City (2002-06) and Peterborough United (2006-07). In May 2007, when Keith Alexander was appointed Director of Football at Bury, Simpson joined the club as a coach with responsibility for the reserve side and scouting.

Simpson moved to Macclesfield Town as Keith Alexander's assistant at the end of February 2008. He was appointed manager on the death of Keith Alexander in March 2010, the team completing the season in 19th position in Coca-Cola League Two. In the 2010-11 season in the renamed npower League Two the team completed the season in 15th position , their best finish since the play-off season of 2004-05. 2011-12 proved to be a difficult season (which resulted in them losing their Football League status) although Simpson guided his side to the third round of the FA Cup. Having drawn non-league opposition in the first two rounds, Macclesfield were given a home tie against Premier League Bolton Wanderers. Macclesfield held Bolton to a 2-2 draw at the Moss Rose but lost the replay 2-0 at Bolton. With only one win in 24 league matches, including defeat by the bottom team in League Two on 17 March, Simpson was sacked from his position the following day. During his time as manager at Macclesfield, on match days he always wore yellow socks as a tribute to the late Keith Alexander and following the death of player Richard Butcher he wore shirt with squad number 21 again as a tribute. (The 21 squad number was retired by the club following Richard's death.)

On 27 February 2013 Simpson returned to Lincoln City as manager but in November 2014, having spent time on gardening leave, he was dismissed. During the 2015-16 season he was appointed assistant manager at Barrow. As Gary is no longer listed as a member of the management team at Barrow, whilst there has been no official announcement, it is assumed that he has left the employment of the club.

Born: 10 June 1959.

Debut 4 August 2018 Swindon Town (Away)

His youth career took him to Brentford, Chelsea and Gillingham before dropping into the Non-League scene when he signed for Sevenoaks Town for the 2013-14 season. Next he signed for Sittingbourne in July 2014 remaining there until December 2015 but during the first half of the 2014-15 season he featured for Tunbridge Wells.

Returning to Millwall he spent time away from the game in early 2018 to receive help for mental health and addiction issues and was released by them at the end of the 2017-18 season.

Signed a one year deal with Macclesfield Town in July 2018. Harry had rather a slow start to the season, getting more into his stride from November 2018 completing the season as second top-scorer with 10 goals. Three of his goals came in the two league matches against Exeter City over whom the Silkmen gained a rare season double victory. He used his physical presence well although he accumulated more cautions than any other team player including one red card.

Left Macclesfield Town in May 2019 when he signed a three-year deal (to the end of the 2021-22 season) with Northampton Town, moving for an undisclosed fee. In January 2021 moved to Scottish Premiership side Motherwell on loan to the end of the 2020-21 season. Departed from Northampton a year early in the summer of 2021 when he signed a two-year deal with Leyton Orient, going on loan to Exeter City for the 2022-23 season. On 22 October 2022 it was announced that Harry had cut short his loan spell as he had found it difficult to settle in the area. Subsequently, in early February 2023, Barnet announced that he had joined them on loan for the remainder of the 2022-23 season. Having been released by Leyton Orient in the summer of 2023 signed for EFL2 side Sutton United. Following Sutton United's relegation from the EFL at the end of the 2023-24 season, Harry decided not to take up the offer of a contract extension, signing for EFL2 side Swindon Town.
