Step into the heart of adventure with this High Five Adaptive Camp! From July 24th to 27th, 2023, in Glenwood Springs, CO, we celebrated our 100th camp. Eight inspiring athletes, six hand-controlled vehicles, and 75 miles of open road embody the essence of empowerment. Join us in commemorating this milestone as we continue to uplift lives and break barriers together.

Reaching a remarkable milestone of 100 High Five Adaptive Camps is an accomplishment worth celebrating. The recent CO DIRT Camp held in picturesque Glenwood Springs, Colorado, was a shining example of the impactful work that the Return to Dirt and High Fives Foundation have been doing. From July 24th to 27th, 2023, eight inspiring athletes came together for an extraordinary experience that combined adrenaline-pumping adventures, camaraderie, and a deep connection to nature.

Access to Adventure and Renewed Passion

Allyson Mallory, another participant, shared how the DIRT Camp provided not only access to adventure but also rejuvenated her mental and physical well-being. The weight of living with a disability was lightened, and her passion for the outdoors was reignited. Allyson’s gratitude extended to the DIRT and High Fives crews for creating a vibrant community and offering these transformative opportunities.

Community and Connection

For Erica Smith, the camp marked a series of firsts: her first time riding in a side by side, let alone driving one. Overcoming rough terrain and taking in stunning vistas was an exhilarating experience. However, the cherry on top was the deep sense of community she felt. Connecting with fellow athletes and sharing in their triumphs and challenges enriched her journey.

Celebrating the Community

Soren Lindholm emphasized the significance of community in these camps. For members of the spinal cord injury community, the DIRT Camp provided not only a chance to explore the wilderness but also an opportunity to connect with others who share similar experiences. The High Fives/Return to Dirt community radiated positivity, and the volunteers’ dedication was deeply appreciated by all athletes involved.
