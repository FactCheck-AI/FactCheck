Images of the CN Kingston Subdivision from Oshawa to its ending in Toronto, ON, a distance of 31 rail miles. From there the CN (as used almost exclusively by VIA and GO passenger trains) proceeds west and north on the Weston, Newmarket and Oakville Subdivisions. West of Oshawa, GO Transit Lakeshore East commuter trains operate on the GO Subdivision as far as Pickering Jct., where they assume trackage of the Kingston Subdivision joint with VIA passenger trains. CN freight traffic uses the Kingston Subdivision from Oshawa to Pickering Jct., where it diverges to the York Subdivision and MacMillan Yard. VIA passenger trains remain on the Kingston Subdivision for the entire distance between Oshawa and Toronto. Images consist of scanned 35mm slides taken between 1980 and 2000, with a few newer digitals taken in 2013. Maps and Timetables are also included for geographic reference.
