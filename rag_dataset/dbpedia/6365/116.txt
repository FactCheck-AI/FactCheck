Best movies on TV (June 28-30)

Here are our picks for the best movies on TV this weekend (June 28-30, 2024). All of them will air on Freeview channels like BBC, ITV, Film4 and Channel 4.

A Quiet Place: Part II

With the prequel A Quiet Place: Day One now in cinemas, it's a great moment to freshen your mind and check what happened in A Quiet Place: Part II — both movies share an important connection!

This sequel to A Quiet Place picks up from where the story finished in the first movie, following the Abbott family (led by Emily Blunt's Evelyn) as they fight for survival in an alien-infested world with the help of old family friend Emmett (Cillian Murphy).

A Quiet Place: Part II is airing on Film4 at 9pm on Friday (June 28)

Spencer

Kristen Stewart was nominated for an Oscar for her terrific performance in Spencer, a very unique portrayal of Princess Diana. Don't expect a straightforward biopic (Netflix's The Crown would work better for that), as this is more of a psychological nightmare.

Directed by Pablo Larraín, the movie takes place over four days around Christmas, during which Diana is navigating her life on the Sandringham estate.

Spencer is airing on Channel 4 at 9pm on Saturday (June 29)

Little Women

Greta Gerwig ruled the world with Barbie last year, but one of her best movies is still Little Women, a beautiful adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel. The book has been adapted many times before, and still Gerwig managed to turn it into something unique and exciting.

With an all-star cast (Saoirse Ronan, Florence Pugh, Timotheé Chalamet, Emma Watson, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep, Bob Odenkirk, James Norton), the movie follows the lives of the March sisters as they march into womanhood in the midst of a war-torn country.

Little Women is airing on Channel 4 at 3.20pm on Sunday (June 30)

Cyrano

Peter Dinklage is phenomenal in this new adaptation of the classic Cyrano de Bergerac. Joe Wright, known for romantic masterpieces like Atonement and Pride and Prejudice, re-imagined this tale through music and a modern-day freshness.

You know the story — it follows the bright poet Cyrano de Bergerac as he helps a clueless man to capture the affections of Roxanne, who Cyrano is secretly in love with.

Cyrano is airing on BBC One at 10.40pm on Sunday (June 30)

Calm With Horses

Barry Keoghan and Shogun star Cosmo Jarvis star in the brutal crime thriller Calm With Horses, which is airing on TV this weekend.

Set in rural Ireland, the story follows ex-boxer Douglas 'Arm' Armstrong as he becomes the feared enforcer for the drug-dealing Devers family. He is also trying to be a good father to his autistic five-year-old son, but soon things get more dangerous than he anticipated.

Calm With Horses is airing on Film4 at 11.35pm on Sunday (June 30)
