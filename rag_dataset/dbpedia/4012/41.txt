Julio Jones is back in the NFL.

The Philadelphia Eagles signed the veteran wide receiver to a one-year deal, the team announced Tuesday.

The Eagles are Jones’ fourth team in as many seasons.

Philadelphia had been looking to add depth at wide receiver behind A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith after recently placing Quez Watkins on injured reserve because of a hamstring injury. In the Eagles' first loss of the season Sunday to the New York Jets, quarterback Jalen Hurts threw three interceptions as the team was held under 20 points for the first time this season.

Jones, 34, appeared in 10 games for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2022. In 2021, he played 10 games as a member of the Tennessee Titans.

Jones’ best years came with the Atlanta Falcons, the franchise that originally selected him No. 6 overall in the 2011 NFL draft. He was named a first-team All-Pro twice and selected to the Pro Bowl seven times in 10 years with the team.

The Falcons traded Jones to the Titans in 2021. Jones left Atlanta as the franchise’s all-time leader in catches (848) and receiving yards (12,896).

Jones' 13,629 career receiving yards are the most of any active player in the NFL.
