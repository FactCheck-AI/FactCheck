Taking on a more alternative rock energy with a splash of Brit pop, Mick J Clark opens It’s Over with his signature brand of narrative-driven storytelling and a captivating vocal, coupled with a fierce guitar soundscape.

Naturally, the composition is full of intentional nuance, both lyrically, metaphorically and sonically. The opus is dripping in genius timelessness, with charm and memorable riffs. We appreciate the relatability of the tale, and connect with this love forlorn version of Mick J Clark.

The guitar solo is simply out of this world, evoking a power pop adjacent emotion which is something that runs through Mick’s artistic core. It certainly reminds us of why Mick is such an awarded artist with a fantastic background of synch deals for his well produced and screen friendly releases.

Speaking candidly on the release of It’s Over, Mick simply says, “This song’s a bit of a giggle, just a laugh, with one important point!” We love how easy going the star is and the confidence that he has with his artistry is tangible.

With reference to his wider philanthropic purpose as a creator, and elaborating on a passion close to his heart, Mick brings up another one of his songs, Me My Body And I.

The empowering song for children against self harming and bullying is already being showcased at schools in the UK, and Mick re-iterates his conscious artistry by saying, “If you’ve been bullied, you now need ‘a voice’ picking you up, giving you back your confidence, self worth, and getting you back thinking positive.”

The empowering song is designed to empower us all and “ignore the bully”, which Mick says can be “life itself.”
