Gold Medal- The 50 Best Bourbon 2023

The U.S. Coast Guard is our nation’s oldest continuous operating maritime service. Both a law enforcement agency and a military service, these ‘Guardians’ support, protect, and defend our country’s coasts and waterways, and rescue those in need. Our Guardian Bourbon represents the United States Coast Guard in its bright life vest orange label.

Aged for three years, the Guardian Bourbon will definitely ‘wet your whistle’ after a treacherous day in the office. Unlike a majority of bourbons, our mash build is 99% corn and proofed with fresh Colorado Rocky Mountain water providing a smooth, almost sweet, well-tempered whiskey. Neat, over a rock, or with your favorite mixer, this bourbon, just like the Coastie’s motto, ‘Semper Paratus’ is ‘Always Ready’.
