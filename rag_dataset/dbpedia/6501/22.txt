Hint: Stratified columnar epithelium tissue is mostly found in ducts and glands. It is formed by column cells. It is mainly found in eye, esophageal gland and excretory parts. Stomach and gallbladder have simple columnar tissues in them.

Complete answer:

Stratified columnar epithelium is the epithelium tissue. It is composed of column shaped cells that are arranged in multiple layers. This type of tissue is mainly found in the conjunctiva of the eye, in parts of the pharynx, anus, the uterus, and the male urethra and vas deferens. Lobar ducts in salivary glands also have stratified columnar epithelium. They perform the main function in secretion and protection. Epithelial tissues can be of different types: simple squamous, simple cuboidal, columnar, pseudostratified columnar, stratified squamous, cuboidal and columnar epithelium. It has many layers of cells; the apical layer is made up of columnar cells. The location and function of epithelial tissues helps in the modifications of the cells.

This tissue forms the lining of a small area of the mucosal membrane of the anus and some parts of the male urethra. It is found in the large excretory ducts of glands like esophageal glands. Simple columnar epithelium is found in the stomach, small intestine and large intestine. Gall bladder consists of simple columnar cells which are specialized for absorption.

From the above information we have found that stratified columnar epithelium is found in salivary glands.

So, the correct answer is option C.

Note: In this type of tissue only the basal layer is attached to the basement membrane. In the excretory system, it helps in the secretion of waste materials into the ducts and out of the body. In the eyes it helps in the secretion of mucus. It provides protection for the internal organs against several physical and microbial damages. It also creates an impermeable layer preventing the entry of foreign particles. It can also act as gatekeepers.
