The 2024 French Open women’s singles bracket has already experienced some upsets, including #19 Victoria Azarenka losing to Mirra Andreeva during their second round match. Andreeva is only 17 years old, which makes her one of the youngest competitors at the event. Despite being relatively inexperienced, Andreeva is only two games away from the French Open final.

A high level United States competitor is also competing in the quarter final round tomorrow, as Coco Gauff is trying to win her first French Open. She was able to reach the championship game two years ago, but lost to the first seed. So, she is trying to avenge that loss in this year’s event.

Since that defeat, Gauff has greatly improved and obtained some hardware in women’s singles. This includes a 2023 US Open championship, which was her first major title.

Gauff is currently one of the best female tennis players in the world, as she entered the 2024 French Open as the third seed. Fans can watch her compete in the quarterfinal round tomorrow for free online by using DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV.
