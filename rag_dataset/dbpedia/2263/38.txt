According to the paper, Eva O’Brian died peacefully and was surrounded by family and friends. She had severe injuries to the brain and pelvic region following the accident. The Berwyn native had been enrolled in Penn State’s summer session and was in the College of Health and Human Development.

O’Brian, 18, was struck by the vehicle on July 3 at the intersection of Park Avenue and Atherton Street, and was flown to a trauma center.
