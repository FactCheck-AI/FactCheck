Paessler PRTG Network Monitor offers a free 30-day trial that includes all monitoring, alerting, and reporting features as well as historical data analysis. There’s also a freeware edition of PRTG Network Monitor that is free of charge for up to 100 PRTG sensors (or monitored aspects). If your trial period expires or you need more than 100 sensors, you will need to purchase a PRTG Network Monitor subscription.

You can use Paessler PRTG Network Monitor to monitor the health and performance of your physical and virtual IT, OT, and IoT infrastructures – on premises or in the cloud. Monitor, for example, network devices (servers, switches, routers, firewalls), virtual environments, applications, services, websites, operating systems, network traffic, environmental parameters, entire data centers, resource consumption, and much more.

In PRTG, “sensors” are the basic monitoring elements. One sensor usually monitors one measured value in your network, for example the traffic of a switch port, the CPU load of a server, or the free space on a disk drive.

On average, you need about 5-10 sensors per device or one sensor per switch port.
