In-Depth Reporting

PRTG monitors the availability of the devices involved (sensors, actuators, hubs, software, hardware), display the actual state in individually created dashboards, and notify in case of failures. It will read and display data collected by sensors as well as device availability, and apply notification mechanisms.

In addition, PRTG stores the collected data indefinitely in the original interval, thus allowing long-term evaluations.
