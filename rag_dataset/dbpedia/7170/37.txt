WHEN the Nobel Prize jury described him as the "Isaac Newton of our time", Pierre-Gilles de Gennes put the description down to "Nordic lyricism".

The modest French physicist, who has died aged 74, won the 1991 Nobel Prize in physics for research which led to the development of liquid-crystal displays; he also carried out research on liquid adhesion that led, among other things, to the development of more effective vineyard fungicides.

Liquid crystals are not quite liquid and not quite solid. One of de Gennes's achievements was to show how liquid crystals could, under electrical or mechanical stimulus, change from a transparent to an opaque state. It is this phenomenon which is exploited in the liquid-crystal displays now in widespread use in such products as flat-screen televisions, computer screens, watches and calculators.

The son of a doctor, de Gennes was born in Paris and attended the Ecole Normale Superieure. After graduating he began research on neutron scattering and magnetism, taking a doctorate in 1957. In 1959 he studied with the physicist Charles Kittel at the University of California, Berkeley.

After 27 months of service in the French navy in 1961 de Gennes was appointed assistant professor of physics at the University of Paris, Orsay, where he founded a research group studying superconductors. In 1968 he switched to studying liquid crystals.

In 1971 he became a professor at the College de France, where he led research on polymers. From 1976 until his retirement in 2002 he was director of the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris.

The commercial spin-offs from his work on liquid crystals spawned a multibillion-dollar international industry, and de Gennes regretted that he and other theoretical scientists had derived little financial reward from intellectual property rights.

As well as the Nobel Prize, the charismatic de Gennes won several major awards and was a foreign member of the Royal Society.
