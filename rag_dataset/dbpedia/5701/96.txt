HAROLD LLOYD in SPEEDY (1928) 86 minutes

Lloyd's last comedy to be released in the silent era was shot on location and is a valentine to New York City. He plays Harold "Speedy" Swift, who is baseball-crazy and can't seem to hold a job, but he does find the time to take his girlfriend to Coney Island, drive legendary baseball player Babe Ruth to Yankee Stadium, and save the city's last horse-drawn trolley in a climactic chase, and film, that is the culmination of his silent movie career.

Directed by Ted Wilde
