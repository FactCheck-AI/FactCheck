Ten Comedy Classics from The Hal Roach Studios

In this two-DVD collection of ten films, Harold Lloyd (Safety Last) demonstrates why he is ranked alongside Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton as slapstick cinema's preeminent funnymen. Lloyd is most famous for his aerial acrobatics, dangling from skyscrapers in High and Dizzy and Never Weaken. But his legendary status was earned mostly on the ground, where he crafted the persona of an endearing Everyman, whose pluck and determination rescue him from life's ordinary (and often extraordinary) pitfalls. Whether portraying a pampered socialite (Captain Kidd's Kids), a lowly bellhop (Among Those Present) or a silly stagehand (Ring Up the Curtain), Lloyd pursues romance and prosperity at a dizzying pace. His unwavering confidence and optimism, combined with his remarkable speed, agility and impeccable comic timing, made him one of the most beloved figures of the silent era.
