History: (Devilman series, modified origin) Akira Fudo is a shy boy who is staying with his friend Miki Makimura while his parents are away on a business trip. One day another friend of his, Ryo Asuka (secretly the son of Satan), informs Akira of the existence of demons and how they once ruled the Earth. Ryo tells his friend that the only hope of defeating a demon is to bond with one, thus gaining its powers, and he convinces Akira that he should allow this to happen. The two go to a satanic nightclub, and Ryo launches into murderous assaults on the clubbers, hoping to draw a demon to them. As various party-goers transform into demons, Amon the Lord of Darkness turns up. He attempts to possess Akira, but the youth's pureness turns the tables, and Akira gains control rather than the other way around, becoming Devilman.

Devilman proceeds to battle and kill demons wherever he finds them, including Amon's former lover Shirenu. Eventually Devilman and Satan himself clash during Armageddon.
