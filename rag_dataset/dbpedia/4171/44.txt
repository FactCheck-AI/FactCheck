Anyone have an original pressing of this album? I scored a nice copy but it's on the light blue MCA rainbow label and it has a MCA 1617 gold stamped on the cover. The spine and back of the cover reads MCA-37070.

The LP itself is a MCA-1617.

I guess I would like to know what did the first press label look like, what was the MCA number and matrix numbers too if you got em. Love this album!

TIA

Good taste by the way.

I've got the in-store promo poster framed from then, and was Blessed enough to see Ronnie and Allen and Gary play a good portion of the album a few weeks before it's release.

It always sounded muddy to me, through the vinyl releases, through the CDs, up until the Deluxe Edition, when the veil was lifted !!! Sounds clear as a bell there, and you get that great DVD of their appearance on The Old Grey Whistle Test.

You googled 2/2/76 as a Monday- ? I don't know when release day became Tuesdays. But reading the cd booklet from the Deluxe edition. MCA 2170 2/2/76 is the correct release info.

Edit: MCA 3022 is listed as either a Tan label or Cloud label, but both mine are on the Black Rainbow Label. Record club pressings can be weird that way.
