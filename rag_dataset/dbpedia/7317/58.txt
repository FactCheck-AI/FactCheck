France is considering cutting its stake in Aeroports de Paris to below 50 percent to raise funds as it seeks to bolster troubled nuclear reactor builder Areva SA, people familiar with the plan said.

The government, which oversees the Agence des Participations de l’Etat, or APE -- the state shareholding agency that owns 50.63 percent of Aeroports de Paris -- is studying the divestment of a stake in the operator of Paris’s two main airports, the people said, asking not to be named since the plan isn’t public. The state has overcome its long-held reluctance to relinquish its controlling stake in a company it considers strategic, one of the people said.
