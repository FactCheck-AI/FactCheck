I have to admit, I am a real sucker for a good detective story with mystery, twists and turns. Thanks to Warner Bros. Home Entertainment they are bringing us four great films from the Charlie Chan Collection. The films included are “Shadows Over Chinatown”, “Docks of New Orleans”, “Shanghai Chest”, and “The Golden Eye” dating from 1946-1948″. The character of Charlie Chan was created by writer Earl Derr Biggers dating back to 1923 and over 50 films featuring the character. If you are into classic sleuth films then this release is definitely for you.

These films have never-been-released and are making their DVD debut. They come in a large slipcase with four individual DVD case inside for each film. They are newly remastered for this release. They are not perfect but especially for films nearing over 60 years old, they look stunning. Warner really gave these some love and it shows on the screen. I hope that Warner is planning to continue this collection because I would like to see further releases with these great films.

Official Premise: The most popular American films in 1930s China, the Chan movies were based on a fictional Chinese-American detective originally created by Earl Derr Biggers in 1923. Over four dozen films featuring Charlie Chan have been made since 1926. In 1931, the Fox Film Corporation cast Swedish actor Warner Oland as Chan in Charlie Chan Carries On; the film was a success, and Fox went on to produce 15 more Chan films with Oland in the title role.

Following Oland’s death, Scottish American actor Sidney Toler was cast as Chan; Toler made 22 Chan films, first for Fox and then for Monogram Studios. After Toler’s death, six more films were made, starring Roland Winters. The character has also been featured in several radio programs, two television shows and a number of comics.
