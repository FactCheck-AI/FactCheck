Next January 1 300 learners will start recorder training during school hours with the lessons forming part of their Life Skills subject.

The training is thanks to the West Coast Youth Orchestra (WCYO) in partnership with Musiquelaine S.A.

The programme was officially launched on Saturday 9 November 2019 and started with a full day training of teachers from Langebaan Primary, Jurie Hayes, Diazville and Vredenburg Primary schools.

These schools are the first to be part of the programme and according to the WCYO team the idea is to have more local schools join in time.

Carina Brown, executive director of WCYO, and her team helped the educators learn the basics. All participants received a recorder and book for free and by the end of the day they could read music and play the recorder.

“This is a fantastic way to bring back music into our schools especially in schools serving needy communities where parents cannot afford music lessons for their children,” said Brown.

She says all that is now needed is for someone or a West Coast business to make a big enough donation to buy recorders for the learners in 2020 who cannot afford one.
