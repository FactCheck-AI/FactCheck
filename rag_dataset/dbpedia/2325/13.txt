The First Minister Arlene Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill have sent their best wishes to the Anglican Archbishop John McDowell as he takes up his role as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All-Ireland.

The First Minister Arlene Foster said: “I send my congratulations to Archbishop John McDowell as he takes up his new role. I have known John for many years in his role as Bishop of Clogher. He is a man of immense wisdom, intellect and deep spirituality.

“I welcome his words of encouragement on working together for the common good, which are so relevant during these difficult times. I look forward to engaging with him and all Church leaders in the time to come.”

The deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said: “I offer my warmest wishes to Archbishop John McDowell as he takes up the office of Primate of All-Ireland.

“I was really encouraged by the Archbishop’s recent message where he spoke about reconciliation, saying that ‘reconciliation is always unfinished’. I think this is an important and timely message to us all; and something we should all be mindful of as we seek to build an inclusive and peaceful society for all by working together.”
