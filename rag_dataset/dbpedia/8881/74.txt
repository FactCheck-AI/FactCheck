North Korea is a country that keeps to itself and doesn’t share much. It’s ruled by a family called the Kim’s, who control everything. The leader, Kim Jong-un, is mysterious, and people don’t know much about him. In this article, we will learn about what is the capital of North Korea, its former capitals, and much more.

The capital city of North Korea is Pyongyang. Pyongyang has famous places like the Juche Tower, which shows the country’s belief in doing things on its own, the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the bodies of past leaders Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il are kept, and the Arch of Triumph, which commemorates Korean resistance to Japan.

Pyongyang has many important government buildings, like the Workers’ Party of Korea Headquarters and the Supreme People’s Assembly. The city has wide streets, big monuments, and clean public areas. These places often show off how strong and important is the regime’s power and prestige.

Where is Pyongyang?

Pyongyang is situated in the western part of the country. It’s by the Taedong River, which runs through the city from north to south eventually reaching the Korean Bay. Around Pyongyang are mountains, like the Moranbong and Ryongak ranges, making the place look nice. Pyongyang lies on the Korean Peninsula in East Asia. North Korea occupies the northern half of the peninsula and the city is built on a flat plain roughly 50 kilometers east of Korea Bay, an inlet of the Yellow Sea.
