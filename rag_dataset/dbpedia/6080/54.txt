HTHB HydroBoost® bottle filling stations help reduce our dependency on plastic water bottles which often end up as landfill waste. The innovative Green Counter™ tracks the number of plastic bottles saved from waste. Bottle filling stations are offered with our optional WaterSentry® filtration system.

Halsey Taylor also carries a line of Marblyte™ composite fountains which have been awarded with the U.S. Department of Agriculture BioPreferred designation. These fountains are produced from corn and soy which are rapidly renewable agricultural materials. The HRFG fountains are durable, attractive, and a responsible choice. filtered models give you extra peace of mind, knowing they are removing lead from the water to the NSF/ANSI 53 certification standards.

Halsey W. Taylor made the decision to dedicate his life to providing a safe drink of water in public places in 1912, when he developed the Puritan sanitary drinking fountain.

The rest, as they say, is history, and while we are extremely proud of the many innovations that are associated with the Halsey Taylor name, we have never lost focus of our original mission of providing the safest drink of water possible.
