The Prison Service Journal (PSJ) is a peer reviewed journal published by, but editorially independent from, HM Prison and Probation Service of England and Wales.

The purpose of the PSJ is to provide a platform for exchanging knowledge on issues relating to the Prison Service. Its scope includes imprisonment, the wider criminal justice systems, and other related fields. It aims to present good quality, evidence-informed, and practice-focused publications to encourage discussion and debate on topics at the forefront of research, policy, and practice.

The Centre for Crime and Justice Studies hosts the online edition.
