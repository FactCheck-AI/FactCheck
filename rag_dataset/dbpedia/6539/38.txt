The University of Kentucky Urban Forest Initiative (UFI), in partnership with the Appalachia Service Project and Team Kentucky, celebrated a significant milestone with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Governor Andy Beshear and other state dignitaries. The event marked the completion of 11 new homes for families displaced by recent floods in Eastern Kentucky and highlighted UFI’s commitment to reinforcing urban tree canopies and promoting green infrastructure.

Wayland, a small community in Floyd County with a population of 360, is recovering from severe flooding that impacted many homes and residents. The flooding significantly affected the town's governance and community fabric, FEMA has condemned several homes, including those of two city council members. The Appalachia Service Project, an organization dedicated to rebuilding houses, teamed up with Team Kentucky to construct new homes.

Governor Beshear and Lieutenant Governor Jacqueline Coleman were among the event attendees. Beshear emphasized the importance of community support and resilience.

“We are celebrating another significant milestone in our commitment to rebuild every home and every life after floods devastated some of our Eastern Kentucky communities,” Beshear said. “From the moment flood waters started rising, it’s been neighbors helping neighbors and everyone living out their faith and values, with a shared goal of making our Kentucky home better and stronger.”

The Urban Forest Initiative, part of the UK Martin-Gatton College of Agriculture, Food and Environment, is contributing to this effort by planting trees around the new homes and throughout Wayland. UFI aims to create a more resilient and connected community by utilizing trees as green infrastructure. This includes planting trees on the home sites, then establishing a walking path connecting the new development with the existing town.

“Our goal is to strengthen the community and mitigate the impact of future climatic extremes through urban forestry,” said Lynn Phillips, UFI co-leader. “We want to create a sense of neighborhood using trees as connectors and to educate residents on the benefits of trees beyond their natural surroundings.”

UFI plans to plant at least 22 trees in the new development and additional trees in other parts of the town. The walking path will feature trees with educational signs, encouraging residents to engage with and appreciate their environment.

“The ribbon-cutting ceremony marks just the beginning of a revitalization effort in Wayland, with plans to complete the walking path and additional tree plantings by October,” said Ignazio Graziosi, UFI coordinator. “The Urban Forest Initiative hopes this project will serve as a model for other communities in Eastern Kentucky.”
