Verse 1

Sing it louder God is with us

We're surrounded by His goodness

Sing it louder if you found grace

As you walk into a new day

Verse 2

In the valley or the victory

No He's never gonna leave me

Sing it louder through the failure

Aren't you glad we got a Savior

Chorus

Nothing's gonna stop us

Singing Your praise

Nothing in the world

Can stand in the way of

All God's people lifting Jesus up

You're never gonna silence hearts ablaze

Shout a hallelujah to His name

All God's people come on lift Him up

Verse 3

Sing it louder He is faithful

In the waiting in the breakthrough

Sing it louder let it roar out

Raise a shout from every rooftop

Verse 4

In His presence there is freedom

It's where anything can happen

Sing it louder 'til we see Him

Aren't you glad we're gonna see Him

Chorus

Nothing's gonna stop us

Singing Your praise

Nothing in the world

Can stand in the way of

All God's people lifting Jesus up

You're never gonna silence hearts ablaze

Shout a hallelujah to His name

All God's people come on lift Him up

Bridge 1

So come on lift your song

For our God is with us

There's no building

There's no ceiling

That can hold His praises

Chorus

Nothing's gonna stop us

Singing Your praise

Nothing in the world

Can stand in the way of

All God's people lifting Jesus up

You're never gonna silence hearts ablaze

Shout a hallelujah to His name

All God's people come on lift Him up
