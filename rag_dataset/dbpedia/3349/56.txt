The good news just keeps coming for Newcastle Jets supporters with star recruit, Jason Culina cleared of injury and given the green light to resume training.

Culina joined his Jets team mates this week after a long stint on the sideline with the same knee injury that forced him out of the Socceroos World Cup campaign.

“I-m not quite back into a team situation yet but I-m definitely on the field and doing some ball work,” he said.

“I-m still a few weeks away from the team environment but I hope to join the full squad in another week or two.”

Widely regarded as the A-League-s best player, Culina says it has been a frustrating few months since joining Newcastle in February but now he-s received the all clear, the hard work begins.

“I would like to think the hard work is over and not it-s time to start enjoying the pre season,” Culina added.

“It has been a long and hard slog to get to this stage and now the fun begins.”

Culina says he-s encouraged by the depth of talent in the current Newcastle squad following another strong pre season hit out against Bonnyrigg in Sydney-s west overnight.

“I like what I-ve seen so far. We have a good mix of talent and I can-t wait to join the team to add some more experience to our playing roster.”

Jets Coach, Branko Culina expects the midfielder to be in full contact within the month and available for trials at the back end of the pre-season.

“Last night we were without Jason, Kasey Wehrman, Ben Kantarovski and Nikolai Topor-Stanley so the sooner our key players are on board the better,” the coach said.

“It-s important that Jason returns and he has been progressing well. I expect to see him joining the team within two to three weeks.

“From there it-s important we give him as much game time as possible to have him fit and ready to go for the season proper.”
