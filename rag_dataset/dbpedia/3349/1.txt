Jason Culina's decision to join his father at Newcastle Jets is a very 'dangerous' option, according to Fox Sports football commentator Mark Bosnich.

Gold Coast confirmed on Tuesday that Culina would be leaving the club after two seasons as their marquee player to link up with Newcastle Jets, whose senior coach is his dad.

The 30-year-old's move has been met with concern in certain quarters, with Bosnich saying a family connection at a club could have a detrimental effect.

"I don’t know... I can’t say it’s a good move. I’d like to say it is a good move," Bosnich said on Fox Sports FC.

"It’s very, very dangerous when you link up with your father as a lot of people have found out in the past."

Culina’s decision comes just days before Gold Coast prepare to take on Adelaide United in their elimination semi-final clash at Hindmarsh Stadium.

Culina, who has been sidelined since undergoing knee surgery after breaking down during Australia's Asian Cup campaign, has been a loyal and integral member of the national team, and Bosnich recognised his impact on the local game.

"Jason has been a fantastic servant to the game... been fantastic for the Socceroos," Bosnich said.
