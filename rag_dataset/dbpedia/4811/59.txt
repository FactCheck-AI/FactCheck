“Working in tech, and especially in the web hosting space requires constant improvement. We try to raise the bar in what we do every day. We believe that this is primarily every person’s internal drive, so we recruit our team members based on this virtue and we also try to support our clients in the same way from day one. ”

Tenko Nikolov, CEO of SiteGround
