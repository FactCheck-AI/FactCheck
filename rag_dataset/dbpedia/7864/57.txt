The John Denver Memorial is a sad reminder of one of the biggest tragedies in the American Music Industry with the death of John Denver who was not only known for his singing and songwriting but also known as being an environmental activist and a humanitarian. His plane crashed in Monterey Bay on October 12, 1997. The memorial is a way to celebrate his incredible legacy as you reflect upon the fantastic ocean views, a fitting tribute for the singer and songwriter. Even if you weren't a fan this location is lovely along the coast between Pacific Grove and Asilomar.
