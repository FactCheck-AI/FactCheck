HOUSTON (Feb. 24, 2024) âÂ Houston Dynamo FCÂ earned a 1-1 draw versus Sporting Kanas City to open the regular season atÂ Shell Energy StadiumÂ tonight.Â

Kansas City took the lead in the 61stÂ minute after Erik Thommy dribbled to the top of the box and found the bottom corner of the far post.

Houston equalized in the 69thÂ minute afterÂ Aliyu IbrahimÂ headed the ball across the face of goal to an unmarkedÂ Gabe Segal, who finished the play by heading the ball toward the opposite side of the goal. Segal had just entered the match and became the 14thÂ player in Dynamo history to score in his first MLS match with the team and the first since defenderÂ Tate SchmittÂ at FC Cincinnati in last seasonâs opener.

Dynamo goalkeeperÂ Steve ClarkÂ was called into action in the 22ndÂ minute when he dove toward the back post to control a cross from Daniel Salloi. Clark made his only save of the night minutes later when he denied a long-range shot from Salloi at the near post.

MidfielderÂ Sebastian KowalczykÂ recorded Houstonâs first shot on goal in the 40thÂ minute after Ibrahim fed a ball to the Polish player running into the penalty box. Kowalczyk created his own space for a shot, but it was deflected behind goal.

Houston thought they had opened scoring in the 42ndÂ minute when defenderÂ Brad SmithÂ found the bottom far corner of the net with a headed ball thanks to a long delivery from midfielderÂ Adalberto âCocoâ Carrasquilla. However, the goal was reviewed by the video assistant referee Ian Anderson and ruled offside.

JÃ¡n GreguÅ¡Â and Segal entered the match in the 67thÂ minute to make their Dynamo MLS debuts, replacing defenderÂ Brad SmithÂ and midfielderÂ Brooklyn Raines.

Carrasquilla forced a save at the near post in the 70thÂ minute following a rebound that fell to the Panamanian at a tight angle.

Houston almost scored a second goal in the 78thÂ minute after Carrasquilla delivered a corner to the head of defenderÂ Erik Sviatchenko, forcing a scrambling save from Sporting goalkeeper Tim Melia. Schmitt almost tapped in the rebound, but his attempt was blocked.

Kowalczyk managed another shot on goal in the 86thÂ minute, taking his chances from distance, but Melia managed to coral the shot.
