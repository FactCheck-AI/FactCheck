SAN JOSE, Calif. â The San Jose Earthquakes fell to Sporting Kansas City 2-1 on Saturday night at PayPal Park.

The visitors opened the scoring in the 48th minute when Erik Thommy unleashed a deep left-footed shot from the center of the edge of the box that found the back of the net. In the 57th minute, SKC doubled their advantage when Nemanja Radoja picked out a streaking Alan Pulido for the finish.

San Jose refused to fold, and in the 82nd minute, a Jack Skahan pass in the box from the right wing ended up in the net when SKCâs Khiry Shelton swept it in for an own goal. The Quakes put on a final furious charge in the waning minutes but could not obtain the equalizer.

EARTHQUAKES INTERIM HEAD COACH IAN RUSSELL

On changing from a back line of five defenders to a back four mid-game:

âI think that the back five obviously helps you defensively, but I just didn't feel like we created enough chances in the first half to be dangerous. ... So, it was actually right after the second goal we went to a back four. We actually changed it at that point.â

On Cristian Espinoza and HernÃ¡n LÃ³pez matching up with SKCâs center backs:

âYeah, I feel like I thought we'd get more pressure on the ball. I thought their center backs had too much time and space, especially early on, so potentially releasing more with Cristian and HernÃ¡n going to a center back to get pressure that way. I thought we were a little bit too deep. I think that's one thing I would have. Well, I thought we'd get more pressure early and we didn't, and then we had to kind of change that about 20 minutes in.â

On Sporting KC matching up with the San Jose press:

âYeah, a couple things. So, you know, in our formation, they have an extra player in the middle with the way they're playing. So, it makes it difficult when we get into a press with Jackson [Yueill] and [Carlos] Gruezo pushing high under their two defensive midfielders, that if they do hit a long ball, the second ball to have a player, and [Erik] Thommy was floating underneath. So I just told him, especially when the ball went back to [Tim] Melia, you don't need to press as high. We need them deeper so they can win second balls. And again, in that halfway through the first half, we did try to get more pressure on the center backs, and I thought that was effective. But I do feel like when we went to a back four, our possession was better. We found HernÃ¡n not in more dangerous places. I thought that looked a bit better.â

EARTHQUAKES FORWARD CRISTIAN ESPINOZA

On the difference between tonight and the win against Chicago Fire FC last Sunday:

âLast game in Chicago, we did a pretty good job in the press in keeping the ball and playing more vertical in behind the defenders. Today, I think we were not in the same shape. I think every time that we pressed we were a little bit disconnected. It cost us a lot. We created a lot of space for them.â

On his role in the new formation:

âI feel good to be honest. I can be more connected with the midfielders and also I can participate a little bit more with the ball to wave the ball in the wide areas. I can be more and more connected with the team in between the lines. I'm very, very comfortable.â

On his growing partnership in attack with HernÃ¡n LÃ³pez:

â[HernÃ¡n] has an amazing pass on his left foot and we know the man can make those passes very easily. We need him to connect passes. Heâs the connection between the midfielders and the forwards. I think his job is very interesting for the team. Hopefully we can help him even more, and also he can help us a little bit more.â
