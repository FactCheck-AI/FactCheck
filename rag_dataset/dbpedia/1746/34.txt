NOTE: The army’s 1886 Medal of Honor publication and the 1916 review board list Custer’s dates of action as 2 April 1865 at Namozine Church, VA and 6 April 1865 as Sailors Creek, VA. In a document in his own handwriting, Custer lists 2 and 6 April 1865 as the dates he captured the flags. The widely published date of action of 10 May is erroneous.
