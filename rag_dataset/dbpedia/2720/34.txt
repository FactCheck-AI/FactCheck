Harold Wilson, Jr. peacefully departed this life on Saturday, November 25, 2023, surrounded by his loving family at Albany Medical Center. He was 76 years old.

Harold graced this world with his presence on November 22, 1947, in Binghamton, New York, born to the late Harold Wilson, Sr. and Lillian Percival Wilson. For many years, Harold dedicated his skills as a mechanic to Empire Forklift before embracing a well-deserved retirement. He was not only a skilled mechanic but a devoted father who cherished his family deeply. His passion for tinkering with cars, possessing an uncanny ability to mend anything with wheels, and the thrill of riding his motorcycle brought immense joy to his life.

Harold leaves behind a legacy of love, survived by his beloved wife, Jackie Wilson; his sons, Harold Wilson III, Douglas Wilson, and Nicholas Wilson (Erica); his daughters, Paula Wilson and Theresa Wilson; his brothers, Roger Wilson (Lisa) and David Wilson (Raemarie); and his cherished grandchildren, Eligah Wilson, Evangelinah Wilson, Derek Wilson, and Dovelyn Wilson. He will be dearly missed by numerous nieces, nephews, and a wide circle of friends.

In remembrance, Harold joins his son, Luke Wilson, in eternal peace, as well as his sister, Sharon Wilson, and brothers, Roy Wilson, John Wilson, and Dennis Wilson.

As a tribute to Harold's wishes, there will be no calling hours or service held at this time.

Arrangements have been entrusted to the compassionate care of Compassionate Funeral Care, Inc., located at 402 Maple Ave., Saratoga Springs, NY 12866.
