HAROLD WILSON d1995. British Labour politician. One of the most prominent British politicians of the latter half of the 20th century. He served two terms as Prime Minister, firstly from 1964 to 1970 and then again from 1974 to 1976. He emerged as Prime Minister after more general elections than any other 20th century premier, contesting five general elections and winning four of them (1964 / 1966 / February 1974 and October 1974). He is the most recent British Prime Minister to have served non-consecutive terms. He first served as Prime Minister in the 1960s, during a period of low unemployment and relative economic prosperity (though also of significant problems with the UK's external balance of payments). His second term in office began in 1974, when a period of economic crisis was beginning to hit most Western countries. On both occasions, economic concerns were to prove a significant constraint on his governments' ambitions. He died of cancer aged 79 on May 24th 1995.
