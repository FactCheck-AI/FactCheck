Original U.S. One Sheet Poster. 27x41. This poster is folded and in fine condition.

Original Paramount Pictures One Sheet Poster (27x41) for the Francis Ford Coppola epic crime drama, THE GODFATHER: PART II (1974) starring Robert DeNiro, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton. Considered by many to be one of the best movies of all time and arguably the best gangster movie of all time, this Coppola masterpiece won six academy awards including Best Picture, Best Director to Coppola, and Best Supporting Actor to Robert DeNiro, much of his dazzling performance being spoken in Italian with English subtitles. This beautifully crafted film presents two parallel storylines of the slow moral decline of Michael Corleone (excellently portrayed by Al Pacino, who was nominated for Best Actor) and flashbacks of the rise of Michael's father Vito Corleone (in an Oscar-winning performance by DeNiro) from his youth in Sicily to the founding of the Corleone family in New York. The beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis used a tint in the flashback sequences giving them a softer, richer look than the very sharp image of the contemporary story.
