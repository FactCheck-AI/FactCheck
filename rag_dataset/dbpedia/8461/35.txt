This is Part IV in our series The Longest War.

Over the last 20 years, journalists and entrepreneurs like Saad Mohseni have built a free and independent press in Afghanistan.

Mohseni recently told the Journo podcast that the Taliban can’t shut that all down.

“We have to be able to continue whether we’re in Afghanistan or outside Afghanistan. We owe it to the Afghan nation, to our viewers to continue, with both news and our entertainment programs," Mohseni said. "I don’t want to overstate this, but I think media has become the beacon of hope for the country.”

Today, On Point: Our series The Longest War concludes with a look at what the future holds for Afghanistan’s free press and, ultimately, its citizens.
