When TWiT is doing live production, you can find us streaming online in multiple places.

YouTube

Twitch

X (formerly Twitter)

Facebook

LinkedIn

Kick

We also stream on Discord for our Club TWiT members. In addition to seeing our shows as they are produced, Club TWiT members in Discord also have exclusive access to watch pre-show setup and post-show discussions. (Discord access is not available with any single-show subscriptions.) Hosts who choose to participate with chat usually do so via Discord.

You can find our production schedule at https://twit.tv/schedule or get a link direct to the Google Calendar at https://twit.tv/cal.
