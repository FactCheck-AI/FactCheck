yes it is. the Google has no information about thaT i think but it is. Ä± have a book named ''ghost ships'' but it is an old book. so this book has an information about that. the suite life zack and cody is just editing about that :)

What are Zack and Cody doing now that stars in the suite life of Zack and Cody?

no, Dylan and cole sprouse ( Zack and Cody) did not quit the show, they just came up with a squeal to suite life of Zack and Cody, suite life on deck, and they are on there as Zack and Cody.

Why did suite life with Zack and Cody end?

OK its not considered canceled its like in between because they've now started filming a new show called the suite life on deck the charactors are the same except theres no Maddie or Carey so they have Bailey (Debby Ryan) and they just added Marcus (Doc Shaw) since the show is a spin off of The Suite Life of Zack And Cody The Suite Life On Deck Takes place on the SS Tipton that's why its a little confusing. They're Not At Camp For The Summer They Actually Go To School on The Ship
