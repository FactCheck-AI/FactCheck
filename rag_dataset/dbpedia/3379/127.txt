These new members join Carlos Santiago (Puerto Rico – Judo), Adriana Escobar (El Salvador – Rowing) and Aliann Pompey (Guyana – Athletics) on the Panam Sports Athlete Commission who will continue to serve until the Santiago 2023 Pan American Games.

We have taken so many strides to strengthen the voice of athletes throughout the Americas, and I know that this next group of leaders will continue to fight for more rights and representation for all athletes,” said Alexandra Orlando, President of the Panam Sports Athlete Commission.
