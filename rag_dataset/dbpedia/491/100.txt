On this week's Coffee, Country & Cody Digest, we revisit our interviews with Robert Earl Keen, who was in town to play the Ryman... plus Travis Denning, chatting about his debut album... and Ronnie McDowell talking about playing shows in his hometown of Portland, Tennessee.

Make the Grand Ole Opry part of YOUR Nashville experience! With at least three shows every week, there are plenty of opportunities to see The Show That Made Country Music Famous -- plus, take the Opry Backstage Tour while you're there, and (on most tours) you'll get to stand in the world-famous circle where so many country greats have performed.
