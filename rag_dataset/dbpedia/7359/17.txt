Courteney Cox and Johnny McDaid have been going strong since fall 2013, and their 10-year relationship has only continued to bloom in the time since.

After first being introduced by mutual friend Ed Sheeran, the former Friends star and Snow Patrol musician began dating in September 2013, entering a whirlwind romance that saw them getting engaged less than a year later in June 2014.

Despite a blip in their relationship — the two called off their engagement in November 2014 but were back together by March 2015 — the stars have seemed incredibly happy together, frequently gushing about each other in interviews and on social media.

“I know that I’ve never loved like I love this woman,” McDaid told Us Weekly in May 2016.

For her part, Cox frequently shares cozy Instagram posts with the Irish guitarist. “He's the kindest, most patient, best listener, curious, caring, not to mention talented and gorgeous partner,” she captioned an Instagram birthday tribute to her beau in July 2021. “I love you jmd.”
