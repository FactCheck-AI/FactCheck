Biography

Nadezhda Sergeyevna Alliluyeva was the second wife of Joseph Stalin.

Nadezhda was born in Baku to a friend of Stalin, a fellow revolutionary, and was raised in Saint Petersburg. Having known Stalin from a young age, she married him when she was 18, and they had two children.

Nadezhda worked as a secretary for Bolshevik leaders, including Vladimir Lenin and Stalin, before enrolling at the Industrial Academy in Moscow to study synthetic fibres and become an engineer.

Nadezhda had health issues, which had an adverse impact on her relationship with Stalin. She also suspected her husband was unfaithful, which led to frequent arguments with him. On several occasions, Nadezhda reportedly contemplated leaving Stalin, and after an argument, she fatally shot herself early in the morning of 9 November 1932.
