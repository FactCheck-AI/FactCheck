Maksim studied dance as a young child in his home country and pursued it as a way to make money in New York City.

The Ukrainian-American dancer told the Morning Call in an interview that he believed winning competitions would lead to more money at the small performances he held at a Russian restaurant.

"I figured in my 15-year-old mind that if I win a trophy, then I can come back and say, 'Look, I'm better now then I was before,' and then I can get a bump to $30 a show," Maksim said.

"That's how I got more seriously into competing," he continued.
