Al Murray is back with his beloved alter ego The Pub Landlord, prepared to tackle the world’s most pressing issues with a sharp turn of phrase and an inimitable serving of lovable larrikinism. With a mission statement to restore the GREAT to Great Britain, The (British) Empire Strikes Back intertwines savvy character acting with animated satire. Subtlety is out the window, as Murray demonstrates a keen knowledge for the world financial crisis, and an unbridled ability to pull off the sophisticated rant – topics include the (alleged) threat of halal beer and why ladies should stick to white wine. With over 20 years of donning the Pub Landlord persona, Al is a veteran of the international comedy circuit, a winner of the heralded Perrier Award and has also delighted viewers on the screen with his British Comedy Award winning series Al Murray’s Happy Hour. Regularly performing to sold out audiences in past festivals, Al is the master of turning common sense into belly up laughter.
