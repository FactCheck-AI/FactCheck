The Chainsmokers’ latest video for “Takeaway” has made the Hudson Yards walkable sculpture, the Vessel, a destination for fans of the group.

In the video for the song, which also features pop star Lennon Stella and Illenium, members of the band land by Blade helicopter at Hudson Yards and climb the experiential sculpture. Stella appears at the top of the Vessel and escapes by helicopter before the group arrives.

Wait times to explore the Vessel are sometimes up to an hour as dance music fans are trying to re-create the video.
