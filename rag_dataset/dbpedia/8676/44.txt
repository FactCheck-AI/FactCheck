After a lot of teasing build-up on Instagram, The Chainsmokers have dropped their Illenium collaboration “Takeaway” featuring Lennon Stella. It’s the New York duo’s first original collaboration with Denver dance-pop star Illenium. The ballad features vocals from The Chainsmokers’ Drew Taggard and Canadian singer-songwriter Lennon Stella.

It’s a tale of broken hearts told from the perspective of a damaged and untrustworthy lover. You know when you fall for someone, and they pull back just when you’re about to tell them you’re in deep? They’re “not emotionally ready for a relationship,” even though they made all the moves.

The video features lots of slow-motion clips of the collaborators exploring the incredible architecture of the newly open Heatherwick’s Vessel at Hudson Yards in New York City.
