I have a copy of John Gardner's 1968 book 'Hideaway' and it contains two Boysie Oakes short stories, called, I think, 'Corkscrew' and 'A Handful of Rice'. I'll post again later with more information just to confirm the titles for you. I'll also post details on the other John Gardner short stories included in 'Hideaway', but I don't have the short story collection 'The Assassination File' unfortunately. Good to see another Boysie Oakes fan on here.

Goldencobra, glad to help. For more information on 'Hideaway', here are a list of all the short story titles in John Gardner's 'Hideaway' in order,

I HAVE

THe basic, and rather interesting premise of the short stories of 'Hideaway' is that they are all read by the lead character between the stories, Dymore, whose spy network has just been blown. From the back cover,

"So Dymore disappeared - on a round-the-world flight that caused him to meet all kinds of people and hear all kinds of tales: funny, sad, exciting, macabre."

The stories are read from magazines by Dymore as I think he is on the plne, so there are the immediate stories and then the back story of Dymore as a 'real' event in betwwen each of the stories he reads and at the beginning and end. This is quite an interesting literary device given to us by John Gardner.

Any luck yet in tracking doiwn these two short story collections, Goldencobra?

I still need three of the Boysie Oakes novels for my collection to be complete.
