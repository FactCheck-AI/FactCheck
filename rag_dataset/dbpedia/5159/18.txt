BUYING A VINTAGE POSTER

All of our vintage Polish posters are lovingly sourced from Poland and were the original editions commissioned by the Communist State to promote cultural events. Polish posters were printed in strictly limited runs to be displayed in town centres, theatres and cinemas - so any which survive have been lovingly rescued along the way.

For us, nothing comes close to the soulful charm of vintage Polish posters; the colours, the offset lithography, the matt paper. But please note, due to their age, many do bear marks of time.

We always do our best to describe any flaws, but if you have any questions at all about this vintage poster then get in touch and we’ll be happy to send you more info.
