THUNDER BAY — A well-known Canadian science correspondent and the first First Nations woman appointed as a judge in British Columbia are among those being given honorary degrees at Lakehead University’s convocation later this month.

Marion Buller, a member of the Mistawasis Nehiyawak First Nation, helped establish the inaugural First Nations Court in B.C. and, after 22 years in provincial court, was appointed chief commissioner for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.

She is currently the chancellor at the University of Victoria.

Filmmaker Stephen Low, who specializes in large format creations depicting the worlds of sciences, surfing and shipwrecks, will also receive an honorary degree.
