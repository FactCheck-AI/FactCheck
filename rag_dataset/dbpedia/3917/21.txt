Recently, veteran south Indian music director “maestro” IlaiyaraajaÂ recorded with a symphony orchestra in London for an upcoming Tamil film Neethane En Pon Vasantham (NTEPV).

The producers of the movie have released the highlights of what IlaiyaraajaÂ recorded with a 108-piece live symphony orchestra in London. It is the opening piece of a song from the film.

Following the successful Kolaveri DiÂ formula of viral-marketing, Tamil producers now periodically releases “first-looks” of under-production films. Recently popular stars Kamal Hassan and Rajinikanth had released the “first-looks” of their films while they were on the floors.

The producers of NTEPV have said that there is more in store. Simultaneous promotion is also underway on Facebook and Twitter.

The film is being directed by a new-generation film-maker, Gautam Vasudev Menon, who earlier collaborated with AR Rahman for his highly successful Vinnai Thaandi Varuvaaya (VTV). He is known for contemporary themes, fluid-style, slick visuals and endearing music.
