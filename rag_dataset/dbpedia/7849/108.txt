Liechtenstein offers an interesting case study on the relations of non-member states with the EU. As a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), Liechtenstein is closely tied to the EU. It is also an associated member to Schengen and has concluded various other agreements with the EU. At the domestic level, Liechtenstein has built up a very favourable institutional and legal framework for its relations with the EU in order to ensure that it can cope with the high legislative dynamics of the EU despite its limited resources. Nevertheless, due to its smallness, Liechtenstein often requires tailor-made arrangements and is therefore also the state with the most opt-outs in the EEA. These exemptions are again an important reason for the high level of support for the EEA in Liechtenstein. Liechtenstein also offers an interesting case study with regard to relations with the United Kingdom. Liechtenstein had to closely coordinate its future relations with the UK with the EU, its EEA EFTA partners Iceland and Norway, and also with Switzerland. It therefore provides a good example of the close interdependence between European states - regardless of whether they are members of the EU or not.
