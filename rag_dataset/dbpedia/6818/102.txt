Shared 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for knowledge of the structure and function of the ribosome -- the intracellular machine that builds proteins from instructions carried by RNA. Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1940.

Steitz was a keen musician and chorister, and considered a career in music before finally choosing to pursue science.
