MONTREAL - Quebec media mogul Pierre Karl Peladeau, Quebecor's controlling shareholder, is officially entering the Parti Quebecois leadership race.

Quebecor, Inc. owns Quebecor Media, the current parent company of QMI Agency and Sun Media, awaiting approval of an agreed sale to Postmedia.

Peladeau, 53, was to send in his nomination papers on Thursday afternoon as the MLA vies for the job of lifting the decimated separatist party out of the dust.

The Liberals trounced the PQ 70 seats to 30 in April, their worst showing in decades.

Peladeau is the sixth candidate to run for the PQ leadership.

His most notable rival is Bernard Drainville, architect of the PQ's ill-fated charter of values that would have barred Quebec civil servants from wearing conspicuous religious symbols on the job.

The media baron has the support of several top MNAs and is the PQ's economy critic.

The businessman has also fended off criticism for his decision to keep his Quebecor shares after entering politics.

Canadian Business magazine lists Peladeau and his brother Erik as the 87th-richest Canadians, with a 2013 net worth of $938,035,127.
