Progressive Writers' Movement

The Anjuman Tarraqi Pasand Mussanafin-e-Hind or Progressive Writers' Movement (Urdu:ØªØ±ÙÛ Ù¾Ø³ÙØ¯ ØªØ­Ø±ÛÚ© , Hindi: à¤ à¤à¤¿à¤² à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯ à¤ªà¥à¤°à¤à¤¤à¤¿à¤¶à¥à¤² à¤²à¥à¤à¤ à¤¸à¤à¤) was a progressive literary movement in the pre-partition British India, consisting of a few different writers groups around the world.

The groups were anti-imperialistic and left-oriented, and sought to inspire people through their writings advocating equality and attacking social injustice and backwardness.

"Progressive Writers Movement in Urdu literature was the strongest movement after Sir Syed's education movement. The progressives contributed to Urdu literature some of the finest pieces of fiction and poetry. Undoubtedly, they were the trend-setters for the coming generation of writers, and their role cannot be denigrated or denied."

The Indian Progressive Writers' Association was set up in London in 1935.

The Progressive Writers' Association was set up in Kolkata in July 1936.

The All India Writers' Association was set up in Lucknow on 10 April 1936 under the leadership of Syed Sajjad Zahir.
