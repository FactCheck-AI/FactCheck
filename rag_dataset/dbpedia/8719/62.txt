Faiz Ahmed Faiz was a notable Pakistani poet who wrote in Urdu and Punjabi languages. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest poets of the 20th century and a prominent figure in the Progressive Writers’ Movement. His poetry is known for its humanistic, revolutionary, anti-imperialist themes and lyrical and musical distinctions. He was also a journalist, an army officer, a trade unionist and a political activist who encountered persecution and imprisonment for his opinions. He received considerable awards and honours, including the Lenin Peace Prize in 1962 and the Nishan-e-Imtiaz in 1990.

According to some critics, Faiz’s poetry can be divided into four phases. The first phase (1936-1947) is marked by his early romantic poems expressing his love for his homeland, wife, and people. The second phase (1947-1955) is influenced by the partition of India and Pakistan, the Rawalpindi Conspiracy Case, and his imprisonment. His poems in this phase reflect his disillusionment with the new state of Pakistan, his critique of the social and political injustices, and his longing for freedom and democracy. The third phase (1955-1971) is characterized by his involvement in the leftist movements, his support for the liberation struggles of the oppressed nations, and his exposure to the international literary scene. His poems in this phase show his solidarity with the workers, peasants, women and minorities, his admiration for revolutionary leaders like Mao Zedong and Che Guevara, and his experimentation with new physiques and techniques. The fourth phase (1971-1984) is shaped by his exile in Beirut, Lebanon, where he edited the magazine Lotus and witnessed the Arab-Israeli conflicts. His poems in this phase express his grief over the loss of East Pakistan (Bangladesh), his anger at the military dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq, and his hope for a peaceful and progressive future for Pakistan and the world.
