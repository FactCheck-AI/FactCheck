Hello Elton John Fans!

Why wouldn't it be a good idea to discuss the many different vinyl pressings of EJ albums?

We can go through album-by-album from start to finish, post deadwax infos, and even feel free to post needledrop samples.

Before we start with the albums, note that "[]-G-[]" is an emblem for pressings at MCA's Gloversville, New York plant. Most (if not all) Canadian pressings use metal parts from this plant and do not use in-house cuts except were noted.

Now, I'll post the deadwax infos for my EJ collection:
