Riders In The Sky is an American Country/Western swing band formed in Nashville, Tennessee on November 11th, 1977. After releasing their first album in 1980, Riders In The Sky began to gain national attention throughout the 1980s and 1990s with their numerous appearances on The Nashville Network (including their own show, Tumbleweed Theater, which ran for five seasons), the critically-acclaimed NPR series Riders Radio Theater from 1988 to 1995, and starring in the Emmy award winning CBS children's show Riders In The Sky in 1991. The band is perhaps best known for their collaborations with Disney/Pixar in 2000 and 2002, where they created the Grammy award winning albums Woody's Roundup: A Rootin' Tootin' Collection of Woody's Favorite Songs and Monsters, Inc. Scream Factory Favorites.

Riders In The Sky are comprised of guitarist Ranger Doug (Douglas B. Green), bassist Too Slim (Fred LaBour), fiddler Woody Paul (Paul Chrisman), and accordion player Joey The Cow-Polka King (Joey Miskulin).
