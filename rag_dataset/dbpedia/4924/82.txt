Vicksburg police say a pistol engraved with the name of former Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice and seized in a Jackson drug raid had been stolen from a truck owned by a relative.

The .40-caliber Glock pistol was among items seized in July at a southwest Jackson home during a drug trafficking investigation. Two people were arrested.

Don Fordice, a son of the late governor, tells The Vicksburg Post that the gun was stolen from his truck in Vicksburg in 2012.

Recovery of the gun hit a snag because Vicksburg police couldn't list it as stolen in the National Crime Information Center Database because no serial number was available.

Vicksburg police Capt. Sandra Williams says the department has been talking with Jackson police about getting the gun back to Fordice.
