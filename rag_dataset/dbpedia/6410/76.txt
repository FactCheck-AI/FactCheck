The Seattle International Film Festival completed its 37th year with an awards ceremony at the Space Needle this morning, where it announced the Competition and Golden Space Needle Audience Awards. Top winners included “Q” Kaushik Mukherjee’s “Gandu,” from India, which won the Grand Jury Prize for Best New Director. The film premiered earlier this year at the Slamdance Film Festival. Susan Saladoff’s Sundance entry “Hot Coffee” won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary, while the high school poetry slam documentary “To Be Heard” and the fishing industry exposé “Sushi: The Global Catch” won special jury prizes. Spanish director Emilio Aragón won the Best Film Golden Space Needle Award for “Paper Birds,” while the filmmakers and subjects of “To Be Heard” won a second prize for Best Documentary Golden Space Needle Award.

“I’m gratified that Seattle audiences continue to embrace the Festival’s wide-ranging selection of films from around the world proving that Seattle filmgoers see more films per capita than any other city in the nation,” said SIFF Artistic Director Carl Spence in prepared remarks. “For the second year in a row, we have surpassed one million dollars in ticket sales, making this another record-setting year.”

The complete list of winners and jury members can be found below.
