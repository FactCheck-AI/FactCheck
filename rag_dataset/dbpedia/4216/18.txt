The Teletubbies, the toddler-sized creatures with antennas on their heads, are following Barney and Peter Rabbit down the path to new ownership as the British Broadcasting Corp.’s commercial arm cashes in on a burgeoning children’s market.

BBC Worldwide and Ragdoll Productions decided to sell their joint venture that owns the rights to the Teletubbies and pre-school shows such as “In the Night Garden” and “The Adventures of Abney & Teal,” the broadcaster told Bloomberg News.
