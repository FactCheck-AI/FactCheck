Description

The First Lady of Song's Original Holiday Classic on Vinyl LP!

This is a faithful vinyl reissue of Ella's 1960 Verve holiday album featuring "Frosty the Snow Man," "Winter Wonderland," "Sleigh Ride," and many more! Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas has been a swingin' yuletide tradition for over 50 years! The album was recorded in the summer of 1960, with a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol.

Here is an ebullient Ella Fitzgerald, exuding the warmth and spirit and good cheer with which the Yuletide is usually equated. Mindful that Christmas albums normally emphasize the religious and solemn, Ella chose in this to stress the festive aspect of the season; hence the latitude employed in the selection of material. As if to ask: Why not the peace and good will of Christmas the year 'round?

So here is Ella for Christmas--twelve happy, winter songs, happily sung to happily suggest that yours be a Swinging Christmas--anytime, all the time!

"Ella Wishes You a Swinging Christmas is a charming, warmly humorous -- and yes, swinging -- set of classic Christmas tunes. As always, Norman Granz's production avoids the schlock that drowns some holiday sets. This is as good as jazz Christmas albums get." -allmusic.com
