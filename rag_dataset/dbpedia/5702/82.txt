Non-Stop-Pop is a radio station in Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online that plays modern pop and dance music.

Description[]

The station is hosted by British model Cara Delevingne. It functions similarly to Lips 106 from GTA III, serving as a contemporary pop mix station containing songs of various popular genres dating from the 1980s to the early 2010s. Cara presents an innocent and bubbly personality on-air, actively encouraging fun and positivity while mocking depressed and uptight people (who she calls "wankers"), asserting she knows they secretly love the music. As with most things, she doesn't seem to take her job very seriously, occasionally going on Bleeter or playing Righteous Slaughter 7 on air, though she does seem knowledgable of the music she plays, giving brief descriptions of the songs and their history. She also comments on the cynical state of society in Los Santos.

This is one of the preferred stations of Tracey De Santa, Josh Bernstein, and Tao Cheng.

( ** This song was meant to appear on this station, but was later moved to the enhanced rendition of Los Santos Rock Radio)

According to evidence found in the development PS3 unit that contained an early build of GTA V, the original direction of Non-Stop-Pop was oriented towards 1980s pop music, before the whole station was scrapped and the songs were added to Los Santos Rock Radio. That version of the station reused the DJ lines from Radio Broker as a placeholder.[22][23] It is possible that the following songs were included in this iteration of the station:

Duran Duran - Serious (1990)

Tears For Fears - Everybody Wants to Rule the World (1985)

Olivia Newton-John - Physical (1981)

Rufus & Chaka Khan - Ain't Nobody (1983)

Trivia[]

"Me & U" by Cassie was removed from the final version of a GTA soundtrack twice, from The Vibe 98.8 in GTA IV and Non-Stop-Pop in the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game. It was then added to the station in the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC versions of GTA V.

During one of Cara's monologues, she utters the line "Everything doesn't have to be so serious!". This likely was a splice taken from the introduction line for Duran Duran's deleted 1990 track "Serious", its chorus of "Does it have to be serious?" likely being referred to. In addition, the waveform of the line's audio suggests a splice was made.

Another monologue might have taken a splice from one of the Duran Duran intros, in particular, the monologue where Cara says "Non Stop Pop FM is less serious, and is actually about having fun!". In between the line "Non Stop Pop FM" and "is less serious, and is actually about having fun!", Cara's voice instantly and crudely changes pitch, indicating it being a splice from a different audio file.

Following the Heists update, "Tape Loop" by Morcheeba was changed to the "Shortcheeba Mix" version on the console versions of the game. The original version remained on the PC version until it was also replaced by the "Shortcheeba Mix" in The Diamond Casino & Resort update (Title Update 1.48).

The original version of the song can still be heard within The Diamond Casino & Resort.

In the in-game files, there are two intros with Cara introducing the song "Circle in the Sand" by Belinda Carlisle, showing that the song was meant to appear on this station, but instead appeared on Los Santos Rock Radio in the final version.

A cover of Wham!'s "Everything She Wants" is featured in IFruit Radio, specifically one recorded by the Egyptian Lover.

Gorillaz, whose song "Feel Good Inc." is featured on this station, released a music video for "The Valley of the Pagans" in 2020 that featured footage filmed in GTA V's Director Mode.
