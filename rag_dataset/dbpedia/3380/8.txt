Toronto gymnast Alexandra Orlando had her Olympic dream realized Friday with a surprising performance at the world rhythmic championships.

With a ninth-place finish in the all-around final in Patras, Greece, she qualified for her first Summer Games.

Orlando, 20, accumulated 65.950 points, posting the sixth-best score on ribbon with a personal-best 16.700, the eighth-best score on clubs and the 12th-best on rope and hoop.

"I'm absolutely overwhelmed," said Orlando, who won six gold medals at the Commonwealth Games last year. "I never would have thought I would have cracked the Top 10.

"And going to the Olympics is something I've been working towards my whole life.There are no words to describe how I feel."

Orlando was the first Canadian to reach an event final at the worlds since 1985. She also qualified 11th for the all-around final Wednesday and needed a Top 20 finish Friday to earn her 2008 Olympic berth in China.

Toronto's Emily Livingstone was the last Canadian Olympian in rhythmic gymnastics in 2000.

Anna Bessonova of Ukraine won the gold medal Friday with 73.950 points. Vera Sessina of Russia was second with 73.900 while compatriot Olga Kapranova was third (70.700).
