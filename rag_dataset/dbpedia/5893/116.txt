And "The Actor" goes to...

The 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards delivered an evening of deserving wins across the board.

After a wild 2023 -- which saw SAG and the Writers Guild both strike -- the actors union celebrated their achievements in their industry, albeit for a year that saw quite the interruption in television and film.

The ceremony, streaming on Netflix at 5 p.m. PT / 8 p.m. ET Saturday February 24, was held at the Los Angeles Shrine Auditorium & Expo Hall.

As far as television goes, predictions had Succession's fourth and final season to continue its awards season sweep with five nominations for standouts Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook, Matthew MacFadyen and Brian Cox. However, The Last of Us and The Crown stole the show.

The Bear cleaned up the awards with Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri taking home the Outstanding Award for Best Actors in the Female and Male category for a Comedy Series. Along with the whole cast taking home Best Ensemble for a Comedy Series.

However, Succession did through with its first win of the night and a fitting farewell to the show with the Outstanding Award for Best Ensemble for a Drama Series.

The Internet's favorite Zaddy finally got recognized for his work on The Last Of Us taking home the Best Performance in a Drama Series.

As for the motion pictures, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did both get a nomination along with the entire Barbie cast being nominated in the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture category. However, Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon took home the awards starting with Cillian Murphy for the Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role and Lily Gladstone for Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Oppenheimer then rounded out the evening with the Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.
