Hollywood's biggest names gathered at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Saturday, where the 30th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards -- honoring the best film and TV performances of the past year -- were handed out live.

Going into the star-studded ceremony, Barbie and Oppenheimer led the pack with the most nominations, four each -- including Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture and individual noms for many of their stars. Oppenheimer ultimately won the Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture category, with Cillian Murphy being named Outstanding Male Actor in a Leading Role.

Meanwhile, on the TV side of things, Hulu's The Bear continued its winning streak, taking home the award for Outstanding Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Star Jeremy Allen White was also crowned Outstanding Male Actor in a Comedy Series, while his co-star, Ayo Edebiri, won the trophy for Outstanding Female Actor in a Comedy Series.
