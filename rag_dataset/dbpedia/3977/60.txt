A young killer was put to death in Virginia's electric chair Thursday night for the 1984 murder and robbery of an elderly widow who was serving him tea.

Richard T. Boggs, 27, was led into the death chamber at the State Penitentiary in downtown Richmond and was given two 55-second surges of 2,500 volts each. He was pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m.Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused to commute Boggs' sentence.

U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams turned down Boggs' request for a stay of execution Thursday and a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling the same day.
