FOR THE GOOD OF THE EMPIRE

Part one of ten

SYSTEM STATION ZS39, 24 March, Y176

"Ah, come in Major!" the lieutenant colonel said. "After all, this is your office. I had thought you'd take more time getting here from the dock."

"Thank you, Colonel," Major Kehlen said. "I came directly here. I can settle into my quarters later. I presume that you want to take the transport back to the Battle Station, and every moment of your personal advice that I can obtain will make my tasks more successful." Both men wore the brown rank badges of the Klingon Army. Both were under false colors; they in fact worked for Klingon military intelligence, the agency known as the Galactic Research Unit. Both had been field officers in their youth, with the medals to show their missions behind enemy lines. Both were now intelligence analysts, puzzle solvers who compared and cross-indexed data from many sources.

"Sit down, Major. No, here behind the desk. It is your desk after all. You are right about one thing, I do want to go home," the Colonel said, "but not until I am satisfied that you have everything you need. It is unfortunate that Major Killiyan could not be here to conduct a normal handover of his duties, which would take an entire week. I have been doing his duties and my own since his departure, and it is up to me to get you into the mesh. If that takes me a few days, so shall it be."

"You are most generous, Colonel," the Major said. "As you know, I had not been selected or trained for this assignment, and the entire concept is somewhat ... nebulous."

"There is a reason for that, Major," the Colonel said. "If anyone knew the kind of work that you will be doing here, you and even your family could become targets. Officially, you are just a mid-grade Army officer on a lonely post guarding a mining station, nominally the second in command. That's why we both wear Army insignia. Unfortunately, you never had the special training for your real job here, although everyone selected for that training is a data analyst and former field officer, like yourself, and like myself."

"And just what is my 'real job,' if you will?" Kehlen asked.

"What you are actually going to be doing is running field agents on Kzinti-held planets, and even some agents on Klingon-occupied planets that used to be held by the Kzintis._

Ask Admiral Growler

Marines

Gary Bear asks: Can a commando ship only purchase the standard ten extra boarding parties that all ships can (using Commander's Option points) or can it exceed this number if it did not receive extra Boarding Parties equal to (10x Number of BARRACKS added)? Example: Federation CDW has 28 boarding parties. The max of 8 (Federation DW normal complement) + 30 (three BARRACKS) + 10 (Commander's Options) = 48 boarding parties. 48 (Max) - 28 (Number on SSD) = 20 Boarding Parties under "Max". So, is the CDW allowed to purchase 20 extra boarding parties to fill its barracks (ten plus ten normal Commander's Options)? If so, are Boarding Parties in excess of 10 allowed as Commander's Options purchased with Force Points or can Commander's Option points be used for these, too?

ANSWER: There is no enabling rule to permit a commando ship to purchase more than fourteen additional boarding parties (ten regular Boarding Parties, two commando squads, and two heavy weapons squads). You are using "Vulcan Logic" to try to create a new rule where none exists. Feel free to submit this to Steve Petrick as a proposed rules change.

Follow-up Question: Does rule (D7.43) allow you to apply "specific allocation" in Boarding Party combat to kill a Legendary Officer (for two damage points), assuming that officer is acting as part of the boarding party action?

ANSWER: It is not clearly stated in the rules, but the various rules put together indicate that (D15.453) applies to boarding party combat, and Legendary Officers can be targeted in this manner.

F&E Q&AFLEET DEPLOYMENT ZONES

Q: Does the Klingon East Fleet's deployment area still overlap that of the TBS? If so then does an overlapping deployment area cause any problems?

A: Rule (601.2) provides for the transfer of command from the Tholian Border Squadron to the Eastern Fleet when the Tholian Border Squadron is released to move elsewhere in the Klingon Empire. There is no overlap. The starbases at 1716 and 2316 are available to the East Fleet for repairs and conversions (rotate the ships to be converted as part of the six ships an unreleased fleet can move in a turn).

Prior to the movement of the TBS, the East Fleet has not absorbed the TBS area, so again, there is no overlap.
