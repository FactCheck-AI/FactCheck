A good psychological thriller gets under your skin like a splinter, sticking with you long after the credits roll. The genre is wide-reaching, often intermingling with drama, horror, science fiction, and action, but always filled with nail-biting tension and, typically, an “I did not see that coming” twist.

Alfred Hitchcock is the master of building suspense and dread, and he’s at his best in Rear Window. The film is told entirely from the point of view of a photographer (James Stewart) who’s left in a wheelchair after an accident. To pass the time, he watches his neighbors—and starts to believe one of them is a murderer. Is he onto something, or is it all in his head like his girlfriend (the one and only Grace Kelly) believes?

While Watcher flew largely under the radar (don’t confuse it with Netflix’s mini series The Watcher), this indie is not one to sleep on. Starring Maika Monroe of It Follows fame, Watcher is the story of a girl who moves to Romania with her boyfriend. Without a job, without friends, and without being able to speak the language, she finds herself spending a lot of time alone, gazing out of her apartment window. And she notices a shadow across the street that’s always looking right back.
