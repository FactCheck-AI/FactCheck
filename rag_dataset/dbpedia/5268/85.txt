TRAILING THE COUNTERFEITER (Oct. 12) â€” This is another big mystery on which the two famous Biograph Sherlocks go to work. These two sleuths, as before, nearly catch the criminal. When they read in the newspapers of the mystery. they set out to solve it. They, of course, trail the wrong man. while real detectives run down the right one, and also arrest the sleuths for butting in.
