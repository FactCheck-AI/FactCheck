Final Fantasy XIII is the first of the series to appear on the PlayStation 3 and XBOX 360. Final Fantasy XIII appears to go back to the basics that have made the series so popular, but of course with the full-capabilities of the next generation consoles. Final Fantasy XIII is the first and flagship game of the "Fabula Nova Crystallis," compiliation, which includes future sequels and spin-offs from the game (much like FF7 did).

The game introduced a new fast-paced combat, which used the Paradigm System, and a new system for for leveing the characters called Crystarium.

A sequel, Final Fantasy XIII-2 was released in 2012 and Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is due out sometime late in 2013.
