Turkish police on Saturday fired water cannons and tear gas to break up a protest over the seizure of Istanbul-based Zaman newspaper on the grounds that followers of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen used it to undermine Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s power.

Police dispersed protesters around Zaman’s headquarters in Istanbul’s Yenibosna district for a second time since Friday’s decision by a Turkish court to appoint trustees to run the newspaper, which drew international criticism from the U.S. to Europe.
