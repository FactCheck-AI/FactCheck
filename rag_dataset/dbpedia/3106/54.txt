Salmon, Idaho

The town of Salmon, Idaho, elevation 3944 feet, is located in the Lemhi River valley on the Idaho/Montana border. The Salmon River is known for being the longest free-flowing river in the lower 48 states, undammed, wild, and scenic for 425 miles! The area is notorious for the expedition of Lewis and Clark, a traveler’s dream full of landmarks and historical sites. We are proud of our local heroine, Sacajawea. The daughter of a Shoshone chief, Sacajawea was born circa 1788 in what today is known as Lemhi County. A driving tour takes visitors to sites including this famous tale of her capture at age 12 and eventual return to her family. The Salmon River is also where Lewis and Clark were forced to turn around and plan a land route after finding it impossible to travel down “The River of No Return.” We are excited to take you through the same rapids today!
