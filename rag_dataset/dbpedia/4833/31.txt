Jena Antonucci became the first female trainer to win a Triple Crown race with her horse Arcangelo, who on Thursday is expected to be crowned champion 3-year-old male at racing’s Eclipse Awards.

This week, we caught up with Antonucci in Ocala, Fla., which is home to her training farm and HorseOlogy, a company she co-owns with partner Katie Miranda.

Looking ahead to the Eclipse Awards, Antonucci candidly shared with sports journalist Lindsay Czarniak what it was like finding an outfit for the event. Antonucci also explained what it would mean to her to become an Eclipse Award winner.
