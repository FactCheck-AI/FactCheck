Leonardo DiCaprio is undeniably proud of his German heritage. His mother Irmelin and his grandmother Helene are said to have given him the virtues of frankness and honesty. It seems that his celebrity fame hasn't changed any of it. Perhaps his German background has kept him grounded during his successful career.

The Oscar-winner was born in South Africa, but has German ancestry through her mother, Gerda, who had German forefathers.

Michael Fassbender was born in Heidelberg and is the son of an Irishman and a German.

It's a shame that Bruce Willis speaks only broken German. Otherwise, it would be a treat to hear him speaking with an accent from the Palatinate region.

He's been awaited there for an official visit ever since.
