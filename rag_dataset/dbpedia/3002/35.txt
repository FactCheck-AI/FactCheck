Donte Archie made the call to David Rebibo asking if his St. Pius X-St. Matthias boys' basketball team could schedule a nonleague game against Harvard-Westlake, the defending state champion. Rebibo, the Wolverines' coach, said yes. Teams weren't exactly flooding his phone with requests.

Wednesday's game at Harvard-Westlake turned out to be one of the best of the early season and provided immediate feedback for both teams.

The Wolverines (8-0) barely held on, 72-71, when St. Pius X-St. Matthias' Tyrone Riley missed on a 17-foot jumper at the buzzer.

Archie was thrilled anyway. His Warriors (2-1), the defending 3AA champions, had proven they're a top team after threatening perhaps the No. 1 team in the state.

"Resilience, fight, toughness," the coach said of what he saw from his players. "I have nothing bad to say."

David Mack, an All-City guard last season for Fairfax, scored 19 points for the Warriors before fouling out with a little more than three minutes left.

"We had a lot of trouble with him," Rebibo said. "We had trouble staying in front of the ball."

Harvard-Westlake opened a 19-point lead in the second quarter, but Mack became like a troublesome gnat in the third quarter, drawing fouls and scoring 12 points to lead a comeback.

Trent Perry finished with 20 points for Harvard-Westlake and Robert Hinton 17. The Wolverines also got contributions from Dominic Bentho and Isaiah Carroll. Tariq Bridges made four threes for the Warriors. Dayvon Gates had 12 points and Douglas Langford 11.

Rebibo was not pleased with his team's effort.

"Credit to them," he said. "They competed, they played hard. We tried to play one-on-one the whole game. I was disappointed in our effort and our execution."
