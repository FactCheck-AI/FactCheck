Phillip Withers is a Melbourne-based landscape designer. The 35-year-old studied landscape design at Swinburne, and fashion at RMIT.

Where is this garden? It’s in a private home at the beachside town of Portsea, about an hour and a half outside Melbourne.

Who are the clients? A retired couple who wanted a restful beach house to escape to.

When was it done? It took about six months to complete, and was finished in early 2018.

What was the brief? To create a natural-looking garden that blended in with the native vegetation surrounding the property, and had a slightly Mediterranean feel. The house is set on two acres [0.8 hectares], and we were commissioned to create five significant zones surrounding it: the front, side, courtyard, rear and nature strip.

What were the challenges? Salty winds and dry, infertile soils, which made the selection of plants particularly important. They needed to be low maintenance, as the owners would not always be there. We used succulents and cacti, including century plant, golden barrel cactus and Euphorbia wulfenii, and contrasted them with tough native species like dwarf banksia, melaleuca and olive leaf grevillea.

How did you deal with the watering problem? We installed an irrigation system that the owners could turn on, and scheduled a series of maintenance visits from our team.

What’s your favourite part of the whole thing? The entrance courtyard (pictured). It’s defined by concrete steps that we poured on site. I love the outdoor entertaining area, too, which floats above nature, making you feel like you’re sitting within the landscape.
