A Chorus Line is an American musical with music composed by Marvin Hamlisch, lyrics written by Edward Kleban and the story based on the book by James Kirkwood jr. and Nicholas Dante. The plot centres around Broadway dancers auditioning for places in a chorus line, with the entire musical set on the bare stage of a Broadway theatre during auditions. A Chorus Line provides a glimpse into the personalities of individual performers and the production’s choreographer as they describe the events which have shaped their lives and decisions to dance professionally.

Following several workshops and a highly successful off-Broadway production, A Chorus Line opened on Broadway in ]uly 1975, directed and choreographed by Michael Bennett. The production was an unprecedented box ofﬁce success and acclaimed critical hit, with the musical receiving twelve Tony Award nominations, of which it won nine, and the 1976 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

The original Broadway production ran for a previously unprecedented 6,137 performances, so becoming the longest-running production in Broadway history at that time, until it was ﬁnally surpassed for the ﬁrst time some twenty two years later, in 1997. A Chorus Line remains one of the longest running Broadway shows ever staged and its success has spawned many successful stage productions worldwide ever since.

In 1985, a decade after the stage show opened to such success on Broadway, A Chorus Line was made into a Hollywood film directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Michael Douglas as the choreographer. The ﬁlm was released in December 1985 by Columbia Pictures but proved not to be as popular or successful as the award winning stage show on which it was based.
