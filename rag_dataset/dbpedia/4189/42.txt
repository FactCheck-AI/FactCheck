Just wondering if I should get it. Is sound quality ok? I understand that there's nothing to compare it too (in terms of other masterings/releases)...but if I were to get only one Mississippi John Hurt album, should I get this one?

It's quite cheap too - only $18 at DeepDiscountCD. That's about what I'd pay for three discs at yourmusic.

EDIT: I'd be interested in hearing about the sound quality on the Avalon Blues: The Complete 1928 Okeh Recordings too. I'm thinking of picking that one up too.

Thanks!

The Yazoo is the best way to go with the early stuff, but prefer the 60s Vanguard material. The live album that he recorded for Vanguard is not on the 3 CD complete studio recordings and is my favourite Hurt.
