I picked up 2 albums from Vanguard on RSD, "The Immortal" Mississippi John Hurt and John Hammond "So Many Roads."

The sleeves to both albums left a whole bunch if small paper remnants stuck to the albums, and on the John Hammond lp, the punched out center hole piece from the sleeve was still inside the sleeve with the vinyl.

"The Immortal" had a few light clicks, nothing that I couldn't deal with or a cleaning wouldn't help. Some inaudible very light scuffing as well. The vinyl itself was cut at Masterdisk. I bit on the bright side, but it sounds good nonetheless.

The John Hammond album, while also cut at Masterdisk, is a disappointment, especially for the $22 I paid. It looks like it was poorly pressed, as you can see a change in the grooves on the first track for both sides of the album, which may be contributing to some mistracking. It also has scuff marks on both sides and light clicking, probably as a result of the garbage that was/is stuck to the vinyl, maybe due to the sleeve issue (paper, glue). This is a shame, because quality control aside, it is a great album! Maybe it's me, but this sounds a little on the bright side as well. Is this indicative of how Vanguard is remastering these reissues?

I wanted to try to find the Country Joe & The Fish "Electric Music...", but I think I'll shy away from the Vanguard re-issues for now.

My copy of Skip James - Today had the small paper remnants, part of the label was missing by the center hole punch, looks off center also, while the record looked flat to the eye when I put it on the table the first tracks you can see the arm bobbing up and down like on a carousel ride. The first tracks on both side mis-track a bit due to this. I am taking mine back for the other copy in the store on Saturday. That aside it did sound good but I won't pick up anything else from this re-issue series.
