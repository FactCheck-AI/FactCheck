We have just released a new version of the Veello Theme tagged 1.3.0. The update adds the long-awaited German translation. The release also includes several minor bug fixes.

Veello Theme in German

Our star product Veello Theme has finally received its long-awaited German translation! We have updated 59 files and hundreds of lines of source code. The translation includes everything, starting from the backend UI and content elements and ending on the frontend modules.

Veello Portfolio in German

The Veello Portfolio product receives a language update as well! As of today, it is also available in the German language.

Member button in header

Apart from the search icon and Isotope buttons, now you can also add a new button to the header ‚Äì the member button. In fact, it's a simple link, so it can be used for the login page for your members.

Responsive image in the page image module

We have added an option to select the image size in the page image module. That means you can make your background image fully responsive and lazy-loaded.

Please note that if you go with a responsive image, it will be added as a regular <figure> behind the content elements. If you do not set an image size, it will be added as a CSS background image.

Bugfixes üêû

In addition to the features above, we have fixed a few minor bugs:

fix PHP 8 warnings;

fix an error in help wizard popup of the module type field;

fix sorting of the images in sliders;

fix the trailer box content element if there is too much content;

fix the selector popup not working properly in the "override all" mode.

Big thanks to our customers for reporting all those problems!
