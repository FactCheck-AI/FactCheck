At first, Contao seems like a "secondary CMS". However, if you look closely, you realize that popularity is relatively high. Here are some reasons.

The usability is definitely not as easy as with Wordpress (WP). The advantage, however, is that many technical changes are possible, which may not be interesting for a beginner WP. WP is generally more for beginners, while CONTAO tends to be more technical.

Safety is a hot topic, especially in German-speaking countries. Even if WordPress strives to really keep up with it or can not do it often.

With a CMS originating from Germany one can be however much more sure that these aspects, also in connection with data protection are implemented faster.

The reason why Leo Feyer developed Contao is that he saw that there were not certain features that online editors need in WP and other systems like Sophora CMS.

It would, therefore, be correct to say that it is a good solution especially for this group.

It takes longer than WP to get used to, but if you can then, Contao is much more extensive and expedient.

Today, even small businesses are forced to meet high data protection requirements. With systems from the USA one never really knows, whether now with each data transmission, the manufacturer company, or a third-party supplier, listen.

With Contao, you can at least be sure that the data is not going anywhere else.
