The Chicago Crusader features a biography of William Henry “Hamp” Lewis, class of 1892, a trailblazer among African Americans in college football and, later, in the legal profession. Lewis was the second Black student to join Amherst’s football team (after classmate William Tecumseh Sherman Jackson) and the first to be appointed team captain.

Lewis went on to enroll in Harvard Law School and to captain and then coach Harvard’s football team. He wrote the book A Primer of College Football, serialized in Harper’s Weekly, and pushed for new rules and regulations to make it what he called “a safe, sane, and wholesome sport.”

Lewis also served as a Cambridge City Council member, an assistant U.S. attorney for Boston and Chief of the Naturalization Bureau for New England. In 1911, President William Howard Taft named him U.S. assistant attorney general, one of four members of Taft’s “Black Cabinet.” The same year, Lewis became the first Black lawyer admitted to the American Bar Association. After retiring from government in 1913, he built a successful private law practice in Boston and was among the first African American attorneys to join the NAACP's legal team.
