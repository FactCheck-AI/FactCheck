Crestwood House Season 3 starts off with a witch-y bang as Shawn kicks off a new triptych of films with Viy, the 1967 Russian horror classic. Based on the novella of the same name by Nikolai Gogol, the film centers on a Ukrainian monk who entangles himself with a wealthy Cossack’s daughter, who just happens to be (or be possessed by, it’s unclear) a witch. He must sit with her deceased body for three nights, praying for her salvation and trying to stop her from rising from the dead to devour his soul.

Join us as we discuss witchcraft, allegory, folklore, and the brilliance for folk horror!
