Bridal Veil Lakes is one of those wedding venues in the Greater Portland area that I have been dying to shoot at for ages! This venue really lends itself to be used beautifully and elegantly with a minimal touch. Adding some well-placed florals really helps to accentuate the already elegant theme here. The venue is primarily outdoors with a central lake that serves as a ceremony background and surrounded by forest all around. So you can imagine my absolute delight when the day finally came.

The couple also incorporated the groomâ€™s Indian tradition into their wedding day, which was a real treat! He wore the traditional kurta attire in a deep navy blue with gold accents. She wore a traditional white wedding gown for her big day but also wore traditional henna designs on her hand to give blessings, good luck, and joy.

Check out all that and more of this beautiful wedding below!
