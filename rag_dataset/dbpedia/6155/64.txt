OliveBSD is a live CD based on OpenBSD 3.8. It uses IceWM as its desktop environment (using ROX-Filer as file manager), and comes with the usual suspects when it comes to software. Firefox, Thunderbird, GIMP, Gaim, Xmms; they require no introduction. There are enough screenshots in there, boys and girls, so enjoy.
