Fosters was founded in 1926 by Randal Rowland Foster on Effingham Street in Rotherham. In the 1960’s the store moved to its present location having outgrown its original site, becoming a limited company at the same time. Today the company has grown into one of the largest independent furniture retailers in South Yorkshire.

However, our original core values of offering the very best quality products, value for money and excellent customer service have remained consistent for three generations.

In 2004 I took over the running of the business from my father Martin as he had from my grandfather. As a family we have been serving Rotherham and South Yorkshire since 1926, and is something we will continue to do for many years to come. The business is not just a store, staff and customers, it’s all part of our family and is something we are very proud off and a very unique achievement in this day and age.
