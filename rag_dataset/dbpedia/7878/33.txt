Remember back in October when Mastodon bassist Troy Sanders revealed the band would be doing voices on the Adult Swim show Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Well this past Sunday's episode of the show, which is now called Aqua Something You Know Whatever (for whatever reason) aired and it's a) hilarious b) features the 'don and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. The episode is titled "Shirt Herpes" and revolves around an extremely metal shirt Carl wears that he hands down to Shake, who then has to battle these demonsâ€¦ you know, I'm going to stop, you can't explain this shit. Just watch the episode. If the Youtube link above is broken, you can (probably) watch it on the Adult Swim site.
