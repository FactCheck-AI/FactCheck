Queens Of The Stone Age frontman Josh Homme turns up in Starcrawler‘s newly released music video for their track “Goodtime Girl“. That song was released on the “Dark Nights: Death Metal Soundtrack“, which was overseen by Tyler Bates. As you’ll see for yourself, Homme isn’t the only familiar face to appear in the video, which was directed by Gilbert Trejo, son of actor Danny Trejo.

The “Dark Nights: Death Metal Soundtrack” was released last month and also featured new tracks from Mastodon, Chelsea Wolfe as well as members of Deftones, In This Moment and more.
