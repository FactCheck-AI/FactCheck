The Lleó Morera house was built between the years 1902 and 1906 by Lluís Domènech i Montaner and is magnificent example of the fusion of two styles, the Art Nouveau or "Modernista" and the "Noucentista". As opposed to Gaudí's imagination and the anarchic tendency of his shapes, Domènech i Montaner focused on rationalism and spatial order. The building is characterized by its beautiful façade in the Neo-Gothic style, topped by a balustrade reminiscent of the great medieval churches, which is lavishly decorated with balconies and windows divided by pilasters. Standing out on the second floor are female figures holding technological innovations of the times, such as a camera, a light bulb and a telephone.
