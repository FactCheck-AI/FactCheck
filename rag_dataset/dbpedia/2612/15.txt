Thesis Title

Willing to Wait for It or Waste No Time? How Relationship Status and Cognitive Rigidity Affect Waits for Service Delivery

Supervisors

Professor Dominique Alexi Greer (Associate Supervisor)

Associate Professor Frank Mathmann (Principal Supervisor)

Citation

Waits for service are an inevitable part of the service delivery process. Across three decades of research, the field has typically assumed that consumers will have similar reactions to waiting. Instead, this thesis uses four studies to show that reactions to waiting are impacted by a consumer's relationship status. Specifically, people who are single are shown to be more likely to cancel a request for service if they must wait, when compared with people in romantic relationships. This occurs because partnered consumers have higher sensitivity towards sunk costs in consumption, whereas single consumers have lower sensitivity towards sunk costs.

This thesis focused on advancing an understanding of the decent work of the gig economy from a relational perspective by interrogating three critical perspectives representing the triangular relationship underpinning platform-mediated care work. The insights from this thesis illustrate how relationality manifests in the complex social dynamics and interactions in work arrangements, ultimately contributing key relational dimensions to consider in examinations and interpretations of decent work in the gig economy and other work contexts.

Thesis Title

Rule-Breaking and Entrepreneurs

Supervisors

Associate Professor Elliroma Baltazar Gardiner (Associate Supervisor)

Professor Peter Joseph O'Connor (Principal Supervisor)

Citation

This thesis focuses on entrepreneurial rule-breaking, a purposeful and discrete behaviour that entrepreneurs utilise to alleviate the regulating power of rules and institutions, which assists them to survive and thrive in the demanding entrepreneurial game. Challenging the popular belief that entrepreneurs are rule breakers and that their rule-breaking is rooted in deviance, a new construct - constructive rule beliefs - was conceptualised as a potential driver of rule-breaking and a theoretical model was proposed to explain how rule-breaking behaviour is embedded in social and commercial contexts. This research has important practical implications for entrepreneurs, policymakers, and society.
