Join Tau Lewis for a figurative sculpture workshop using different materials she has collected and scavenged. Lewis will introduce her practice, drawing connections between her material choices and the thematic concerns of her work. Participants are encouraged to bring one or two meaningful materials of their own to incorporate within their sculpture. Her work is on view inTau Lewis: when last you found me here between 25 August â€“ 2 December 2018. All are welcome. Register below for this workshop.
