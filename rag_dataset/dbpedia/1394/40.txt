four city blocks, 100 recycled plastic bottles, Tau artifacts and documentation

site-specific installation for South Orange, NJ on the occasion of Tony Smiths’s 100th birthday

An exhibit in the form of an outdoor path consisting of 100 “vitrines” (recycled plastic bottles) that act as trail-markers, each containing information, reactions, images and artifacts that help tell the story of how Tau came to be, from multiple points of view. Much like a message in a bottle, sent in hopes of finding a sympathetic recipient in a sea of passersby, this installation provides insight into both the sculpture and its host community.
