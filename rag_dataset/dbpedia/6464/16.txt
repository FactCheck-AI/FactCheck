Further talks between the rail union and TransAdelaide have failed to resolve a pay dispute.

The two sides met today but the union is still concerned about the possible relocation of staff from the Adelaide rail yards to other suburbs.

The union is proposing a clause in a new enterprise agreement that would give rail workers bargaining power over any changes.

Ray Hancox from the Rail Tram and Bus Union is confident the dispute can be resolved soon.

"I don't believe we're that far at all. As I said it's just a matter of checking the words with our members to make sure that they do indeed address their concerns and if they don't they'll let us know and we'll go back and come up with a form of words that hopefully will address those concerns," he said.

Yesterday rail union members voted against TransAdelaide's latest pay offer during a four hour stop-work meeting.

Workers were offered a three year deal but it was rejected after the issue of a possible relocation emerged.

The rail union has ruled out further industrial action as talks continue.
