Adelaide's trains will shut down for four hours again tomorrow as the union representing rail workers reports on the latest enterprise bargaining negotiations with TransAdelaide.

TransAdelaide improved its offer of a pay rise last week to 9.5 per cent over two years.

The Rail, Tram and Bus Union wants 11.5 per cent over two years.

The union's state secretary Ashley Waddell says he is hoping for a better offer when he meets TransAdelaide management today.

"Hopefully the meeting today we'll be able to address things further and then tomorrow we'll be holding a four hour stop-work between the hours of 10:00am and 2:00pm," he said.

"Trains will start shutting down between probably 8:30am and 9:30am so that all our members are off the job by 10:00am so that we can have a report back at a mass meeting, inform the members of where we're at, we're we've been able to progress it and take some directions."

The union is not ruling out further strikes.

It has previously asked members to consider unlimited rolling stoppages of between four and 48 hours.

Meanwhile the State Opposition says the government should act to stop rail workers from walking off the job tomorrow.

The Opposition Transport spokesman Duncan McFetridge says the government should be providing better incentives for workers to help resolve the dispute.

"The government needs to get off their backsides and do something about this," he said.

"This is the second rail strike within a month and where's Mike Rann and Pat Conlon on this?

"Tomorrow we've got another four hour strike by the rail drivers, passenger service attendants and the station platform coordinators, we hear nothing from the government."

The State Government is standing back from the dispute, saying it is a matter for TransAdelaide.
