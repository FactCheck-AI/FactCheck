Reaching Audiences: Exploring Opportunities in Hispanic Media and Market Research

As a self-proclaimed “thinkologist,” Bruce Goerlich puts his more than 30 years of media research savvy to use every day working with Rentrak's Research, IT and Operations teams to build and evolve the big data research machine behind Rentrak's powerful rating systems.

In his role as Chief Research Officer, Bruce says he is driven to help advertisers, broadcast and cable networks, stations, and agencies to employ the extensive and precise Rentrak intelligence to find and leverage the best media opportunities.

Bruce's love of learning and cutting-edge research is apparent in his dedication to advancing the industry's knowledge of new insights and developing trends. He maintains a steady online presence with his blog, BruceGoerlich.com, and on Twitter (@bgoerlich). He is also an in-demand speaker for the Advertising Research Foundation, AAAA, and the ANA and at renowned research and television industry events around the country.

He has served as Chairman of the Advertising Research Foundation and President of the Market Research Council. Prior to Rentrak, he served as President, Strategic Services for Zenith Optimedia North America.

When he's not busy adding to his own media research know-how, Bruce can be found in his Forest Hills home, relaxing with his husband, two very spirited cats, the dog, his mother in-law in the garden apartment and a good book.
