Ahead of Interphex, Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma (Aji Bio-Pharma), a contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), announced that it is expanding its San Diego, US, and Wetteren, Belgium, facilities.

The former site has only recently begun commercial operations, where it holds high potent product conjugation and full isolated fill line service services.

In a total investment of over $100m (€88m), the San Diego site will have a flexible fill line added to support a range of drug substance active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), which will increase capacity by 50%.

The site will also receive automated packaging and labelling equipment to provide serialization capabilities, terminal sterilization services can now be offered, and continuous flow and additional capacity will be provided for small molecule API manufacturing.

The Wetteren facility will receive a new quality control lab, and highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredient (HPAPI) capacity will also be increased.

David Enloe, CEO of Aji Bio-Pharma, said, “These capacity expansions ensure that we have the assets and capabilities to meet current and future industry needs. They also ensure we continue to attract the best talent to add to our world-class teams.”​
