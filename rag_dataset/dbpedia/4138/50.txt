"Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much" (Luke 7:47).

St. Mary Magdalene's conversion is one of the most encouraging incidents recorded in Sacred Scripture. By the grace of God, she was able to turn from a life of sin to a life wholly dedicated to her Divine Redeemer. What assisted Mary Magdalene to rise from sinner to saint so quickly? What are the qualities necessary to achieve such a genuine conversion? Mother Mary Bosco addresses these questions, and draws our attention to the great reward - that is peace of soul - which Christ gave St. Mary Magdalene for her generous efforts.
