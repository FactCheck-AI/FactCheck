Preganziol (TV), altitude 5 m/16 feet above sea level; train station at Preganziol 2.7 km/1.7 miles to the south. The villa is located on the eastern side of the Terraglio (the ancient road from Venice to Treviso).

The villa takes its name from Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi who lived there at the end of the eighteenth century and who hosted a literary salon which earned her the nickname, the Italian Madame Stael. Among her guests were Ippolito Pindemonte, Ugo Foscolo, Lord Byron, and Antonio Canova.

The villa has a classical facade typical of many Venetian villas, surmounted by a pediment with three statues and with balconies at the piano nobile [main floor, the second floor to Americans] and on the second floor [third floor to Americans]. Noteworthy are the landscaped grounds and especially the two (*)barchesse [support structures] that flank the south and north sides of the villa, designed by Andrea Pagnossin.

The villa is not open to the public.
