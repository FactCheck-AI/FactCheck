The stay in Tuscany and the writing of Le Grazie (1812-1813)

Foscolo left Milan in December 1811 after the failure of Ajace and the attacks in “Poligrafo” and had a long spell in Venice, near to his family and long-standing friend Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi, who he saw for the last time. His return to Milan coincided with a period of depression and disquiet which Foscolo relieved at the start of the summer with a visit to the nobleman Alberico Barbiano at his residence, Villa Belgiojoso, in the countryside near Pavia. After another unhappy stay in Milan, Foscolo decided to leave what had become a “prison” for him and chose “exile” in Tuscany, attracted by the memories of his stay in 1800 and by his “love of the literature and language” (Ep. IV, p. 77). He arrived in Florence in August 1812, after a stay in Bologna where he visited Cornelia Martinetti, one of the three priestesses of Le Grazie.
