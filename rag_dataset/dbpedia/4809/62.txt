Cheap Hosting Rating

SiteGround Cheap Hosting Review

SiteGround offers cheap hosting, also known as shared hosting, which is the best option for users who are just starting out and need an affordable hosting solution. With cheap hosting, many websites will share resources of the same server, which makes the cost low.

Although it’s SiteGround’s cheapest hosting option available, there’s nothing to be concerned about since your files and data will be secure on the server.

SiteGround offers 3 different shared hosting plans: Startup, GrowBig, and GoGeek.

The Startup plan allows you to host only one website which is great for bloggers and websites of small businesses. With all other plans, you can host multiple websites.

With every SiteGround cheap hosting plan, you get dozens of one-click installers for WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, etc. that help you quickly start a website.

The GoGeek plan offers geeky advanced features like PCI compliant server, WordPress and Joomla staging, and one-click git repo creation.

SiteGround doesn’t have VPS hosting (virtual private server) plans, but they do offer cloud hosting plans, which is an in-between solution for sites that outgrows shared hosting but can’t afford to have dedicated hosting.

SiteGround comes with a unique set of features that help you create a blazing-fast website with ease. Let’s take a look at some of the important features you need to look for when hosting a website.

Free SSL

With every SiteGround hosting plan, you get a free SSL certificate. When you host your website on the SiteGround platform, a free standard SSL certificate is automatically enabled without any effort.

SiteGround integrates with the Let’s Encrypt project to provide SSL certificates to its users. An SSL certificate protects user data and helps meet search engine requirements to improve website rankings.

Free Cloudflare CDN

SiteGround offers a free CDN which enables the website to load from the nearest data point for a user. Cloudflare’s CDN, clubbed with SiteGround hosting, ensures your website loads quickly and has the fastest response time.

Free Email Service

SiteGround lets you create a free email address with your domain name. There’s no limit to adding email accounts to your hosting plan.

The email tools include a user-friendly webmail interface, email forwarding option, autoresponders, and more. They also support SMTP, POP3, and other email protocols to deliver your emails smoothly.

Super Caching

By default, SiteGround enables a caching system for all users on their servers. This means your site will load faster than usual from the memory of the server.

It comes with a SuperCacher service to further improve the website loading speed. This service is available specifically for their premium plans (GrowBig and GoGeek).

Free Auto Daily Backups

Many web hosting services don’t back up your site on a daily basis. However, all SiteGround plans come with daily automatic backups, ensuring you don’t have to remember to back up your site regularly.

You can also generate on-demand backups from SiteGround’s provided tools. This service is free on the premium plans and costs a minimal fee on the starter plan.

Website Transfer Tool

When moving a website from one host to another, you need to be careful of traffic, security, backups, and many other things. SiteGround offers a free WordPress plugin that works magically to move your WordPress website without affecting your content or configuration.

SiteGround also provides a professional website migration and transfer service. This is a paid service where a team of experts will move your site while you sit back and relax.

SSD Storage

SiteGround uses solid-state drives (SSDs) instead of Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) for storage. Since SSDs don’t have moving parts, they’ve been proven to improve site performance compared to websites that use HDD storage.

Advanced Security

Security is the key concern when hosting a website with any provider. SiteGround provides free in-house SSH to restrict user account access for your hosting.

It gives an encrypted connection to your hosting account, so web developers and website admins can access the web server in a secure environment. These security features also help manage large files and databases securely.

SiteGround Hosting Pros:

Let’s take a look at how SiteGround stacks up against the competition:

Choose Your Data Center

Even with a shared hosting plan, you’ll be asked to choose your preferred data center. This way, you can ensure your site is hosted on servers closer to your audience geographically.

Amazing Customer Support

SiteGround is well-known for its superior customer service. Best of all, you don’t have to wait more than a few seconds for the next available operator because they have additional support staff in all shifts, so there’s always someone to pick up the live chat. With the GoGeek plan, you’ll get priority support.

Unmetered Bandwidth

The bandwidth is unmetered meaning you’re not charged based on the bandwidth. SiteGround’s StartUp plan, GrowBig plan, and GoGeek plan come with an unmetered data transfer that you can use as much as you like.

Money-Back Guarantee

SiteGround offers a 30-day money-back guarantee on all their plans. This will allow you to test the service and tools with full options for up to a month and if you feel SiteGround isn’t the host for your site, you can request a full refund.

The refund doesn’t include the domain registration fees. The domain name will be your property anyway.

SiteGround Hosting Cons:

Here are some limitations of SiteGround Hosting…

Expensive Plans

Compared to other hosting providers like Bluehost, SiteGround’s pricing is a bit expensive. However, SiteGround offers several unique features than Bluehost for faster page rendering.

No Free Domain

Unlike popular web hosting services, SiteGround doesn’t offer free domain names with their plans. If you’re starting your website, this will be an additional cost to your budget.

SiteGround Uptime Guarantee and Speed Tests

SiteGround ensures a 99.9% uptime guarantee. Best of all, if you ever experience more than 0.1% downtime on a yearly basis, you will be compensated.

To provide our users with real facts, we built a WordPress test site environment and perform several speed tests using the following tools:

Pingdom

Load Impact

Bitcatcha

According to Pingdom’s website speed test, our test site loads in less than a second for a server in Dallas, Texas. That’s faster than 95% of all tested sites.

Apart from Pingdom, we also used a testing tool called Load Impact to figure out how SiteGround handles visitors during a traffic surge. Load Impact sent some virtual users (VUs) to our site and gradually built up to 100 visitors at a time.

In the chart, you can find a blue line (VUs active) which shows the number of virtual users sent to our SiteGround site and a green line (VU load time) which represents how much time it would take to load a web page for a user.

SiteGround performed almost consistently except for a spike when there were 50 users on the site. It quickly recovered and page load time remained steadily low even with more users.

It’s worth noting that the site never went down during our speed test. Take a look at the report below.

SiteGround Server Response Time

The content on your website has a huge influence on page loading time. For instance, if your site has too many images, it will take more time to load than a lightweight site. In fact, images account for most of the downloadable bytes in a typical site.

To get accurate results, instead of the analysis of page load time alone, we decided to test the actual server response time by entirely ignoring the content of our SiteGround site.

To track our SiteGround server response time, we used a tool known as Bitcatcha. Bitcatcha works differently from Pingdom.

Bitcatcha ignores the content of your page and records the page loading time from eight different global locations: New York, LA, London, Brazil, India, Singapore, Japan, and Australia. The speed for each location is measured three separate times, and then the results are averaged.

From the result, it’s evident that SiteGround is the perfect choice if your target audience is mostly located in the United States. In the United States, the server responded in just a fraction of a second. In all other locations, except Japan, the server responded within less than a second.

If your target audience is mostly located in Japan, it’s in your best interest to move your site to their Asia-Pacific data center for the best results.
