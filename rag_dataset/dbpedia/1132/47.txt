Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych appointed Valery Khoroshkovsky as first deputy prime minister in his latest Cabinet switch before parliamentary elections in October.

Khoroshkovsky, 43, was also dismissed today as finance minister, a post he assumed on Jan. 18, according to a statement on Yanukovych’s official website. Khoroshkovsky had previously been in charge of the Ukraine’s security service. He replaces Andriy Klyuev, who was named as secretary of the National Defense and Security Council last week.
