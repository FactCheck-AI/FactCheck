The Duchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg (German: Herzogtum Braunschweig und Lüneburg), commonly known as the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg or Brunswick-Lüneburg, was an imperial principality of the Holy Roman Empire in the territory of present day Lower Saxony.

This article is about the principality of the Holy Roman Empire that existed from 1235 to 1806. For the two largest states during most of the 18th century, see Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

In 1235, Otto I was enfeoffed with the newly founded Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg at the Court of Mainz. It was based on the two castles in Brunswick and Lüneburg and the associated estate of the House of Welf. In 1269 there was a first division between the brothers Albrecht and Johann. The resulting principalities of Brunswick and Lüneburg together continued to form the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
