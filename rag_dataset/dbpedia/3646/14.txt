Longtime NHL referee Wally Harris dies at 88 | NHL.com

Worked 6 Stanley Cup Finals, became League’s 1st Director of Officials

Wally and his crew needed a security escort back to their hotel. First one to call Wally in his room was Bobby Orr to make sure he'd made it back safely.

Bruins fans, at their best.

Great to hear some forgotten names. Favorite was Darcy Rota.
