Namibiaâ€™s Ohorongo Cement has been recognised by the Environmental Investment Fund (EIF) with the Environmental Excellence Among Industries Award.

EIF works in close cooperation with the Ministry of Environment & Tourism and the Sustainable Development Advisory Council. The Awards are aimed at recognising and celebrating companies, local authorities and individuals who have promoted and demonstrated sustainable and responsible development in Namibia.

The Category of Environmental Excellence Among Industries seeks to reward the application of innovative technologies and exciting approaches, which minimise operational impacts on the environment. Energy and water efficiency are key focus areas, as well as environmentally friendly approaches to the management of waste.

Ohorongo Cement wants to thank the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, together with the EIF and the Sustainable Development Advisory Council and others for placing the appropriate focus on this very important aspect of Sustainable Development. The company takes pride in the fact that its CO2 emissions are below the European standard. However it continues to strive towards improvement through improving energy efficiencies and reducing waste.

Ohorongo is planning to utilise the award to plough back into the small community of Otavi. It will liaise with the Otavi Town Council and identify an environmental community project to which the company can contribute.
