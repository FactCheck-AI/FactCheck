2025 Oscars Predictions:

Best Supporting Actor

Weekly Commentary (Updated July 28, 2024): It’s difficult to assess any of the supporting categories as we never know which performers will stand out.

What we know so far, at least based on the source material and early buzz, is Stanley Tucci (“Conclave”) and Samuel L. Jackson (“The Piano Lesson”), two overdue and beloved veteran actors, are said to deliver in their respective films.

The first teaser for James Mangold’s “A Complete Unknown” shows Edward Norton, a three-time Oscar nominee who also could vie for his first career statuette.

The buzz for Ridley Scott’s sequel “Gladiator II” continues to make the rounds, and with it, a possible Denzel Washington lead actor campaign, instead of the presumed supporting as Joaquin Phoenix executed from the 2001 best picture winner. If that’s the case, that leaves an opening for co-stars Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn.

Sprawling ensembles, such as Jason Reitman’s “SNL: 1975” and RaMell Ross’s “Nickel Boys,” could also put one or two of their cast members in the hunt.

There will be plenty more to analyze as the race unfolds. Sit tight.
