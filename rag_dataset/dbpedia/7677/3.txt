2012 Women's Institute for Summer Enrichment

PROGRAM OVERVIEW

WISE is a one-week residential summer program at a TRUST campus that brings together graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors from all disciplines that are interested in Ubiquitous Secure Technology and the social, political, and economical ramifications that are associated with this technology. Thought leaders from academia, industry, and government come to WISE to teach power courses in several disciplines, including computer science, engineering, economics, law, and public policy. The one-week program includes rigorous classes and allows participants opportunities for career development and to network with their peers.

The 2012 WISE Institute was held June 19-22, 2012 on the University of California, Berkeley campus. A copy of the agenda can be found here.
