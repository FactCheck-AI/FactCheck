A Good Place for the Night

Savyon Liebrecht

This collection by one of Israel’s most popular authors turns upon issues of family, place and disconnection, and the stories have the dreamy, evocative smoothness of underwater films. As one character observes “I was frightened by the unfamiliar sensations flooding me, as if I'd lost my old place and still didn't have a new one.”

Disorientation afflicts Liebrecht's characters from the Israeli reporter in Munich to cover a Nazi war trial to the mentally handicapped man trying to make a life among unsympathetic members of a kibbutz.

In the last and finest story, “A Good Place for the Night,” a woman struggles to survive in an unnamed place virtually destroyed by a nuclear catastrophe. The permanent unsettledness of Israel is exported and globalized here; no matter where Liebrecht's characters go or what they do, they are never yet truly at home.

“I read these stories with bated breath...a wondrous and thrilling human and literary experience.”

—Orit Harel, MAARIV (Tel Aviv)
