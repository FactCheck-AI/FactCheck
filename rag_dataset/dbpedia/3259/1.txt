Greece, as expected from the Olympic host nation, has confirmed a huge athletics team for the Athens Games.

A team of 63 men and women, the biggest ever team for Greece in the history of Olympic Games, is going to compete in the Athens Olympic Stadium, in their home country.

All athletes who set standards according to the IAAF rules are included in the squad, while 5 more athletes will have the possibility to be added to the team in the coming days, if they reach the qualifying marks before August 8.

The team includes all top Greek athletes who won medals in the Sydney Olympics and Paris World Championships, as well as some rising stars among which is the new 400m Hurdles sensation, Fani Halkia, the race walkers Athanassia Tsoumeleka and Athina Papayianni, and the long jumper Louis Tsatoumas.

According to the Federation, they hope at least 15 athletes to reach the finals of their respective events.

The only top athlete who won’t participate in the Games is the javelin thrower Kostas Gatsioudis. Facing serious injuries during the last two years, Gatsioudis has announced his decision to abandon his effort for this year

“After all these injuries, the time I had to return was not enough. I lost a great chance, but I won’t stop. Now I have to give up thinking of what it happened and start preparing for my next participation in the World Championships next year”, he said to the Greek television yesterday.
