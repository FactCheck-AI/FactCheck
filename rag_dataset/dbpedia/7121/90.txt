It extends between Mundka and Inderlok (a Red Line station) together with a branch track linking Ashok Park Main Station to Kirti Nagar Station through blue line. This line is totally elevated that runs parallel to NH 10 road of West Delhi. This line covers 17 stations together with an interchange spot with a total distance of 18.46 km.

This Green line was inaugurated in 2 stages, the first phase of 15.1 km between Inderlok and Mundka was initiated on April 3, 2010 followed by 3.5 km stretch between Kirti Nagar and Ashok Park Main subsidiary route on August 27, 2011. With an aim to develop transport in the region of National Capital, Indian Union Government approved the extension of Metro Rail service between Mundka and Bahadurgarh in the state of Haryana on August 6, 2012. This 11.18 km route from Mundka to Bahadurgarh crosses 7 stations like City Park, Bahadurgarh Bus Stand, Modern Industrial Estate, Tikri Border, Tikri Kalan, Ghevra and Mundka Industrial Area.

The project was initiated during 2012 and is expected to be completed before March, 2016. After completion, this will deliver good transport service for people to travel between Bahadurgarh and Delhi. By 2016, approximately 96,000 people are expected to use Metro service, whereas by 2121-2122, the number may go upto 1, 48, 000. An order for supplementary rolling stock was placed by DMRC.

Branch Line

The branch lane of Kirti Nagar was intended to decrease the time and fare for people but because of the slow transport pace of standard gauge trains, commuters are forced to select the former longer distance through interchanging at Rajiv Chowk and Kashmere Gate. The percentage has been decreased with equal population at Kirti Nagar and Inderlok and majority of them get down at Nangloi, Peeragarhi and Ashok Park Main. By the year 2021, it is expected to complete and it will be extended between Dwarka Sector 28, Delhi Gate and Bahadurgarh to decrease the crowd in the present interchange stations.
