Iran Press/ Iran News: Due to its thinness and lightness, Kalash has been demanded by many customers in summer.

The sole of this shoe is completely made of fabric and the upper part is made of threads. In addition to Mariwan, Kalash shoe weaving is common in other cities of Kurdistan province, including Sanandaj, Divandarre, Sarvabad, Kamyaran, and Saqqez; but Mariwan is considered as the center of production of this shoe due to the high number of producers.

The presence of 4,355 artists active in the field of Kalash shoe production persuaded the experts of the World Handicrafts Council to register them by traveling to Mariwan city.

Kalash shoes are specific to Kordestan Province, which are made of natural fabrics.

They are used in Iran and are also exported to Iraq, especially the Kurdistan region of this country.
