Here we are!

The Christmas period and its Xmas movies on TV, the light garlands which bloom in the streets, the windows which are being prepared ...

And of course, the Christmas songs which make their arrival, even here at IMC!

Here's one by Tim Myers.

So this name may not ring a bell to you, but at Indie Music Center, it's not unknown.

Indeed, our creator has in his playlist of favorite songs a certain "The Journey" track, sung by a duo called "FM Radio".

Remember, we often played it to you when we were still a radio station.

Okay, we'll help you a little more.

OneRepublic, does that mean anything to you?

Well, Tim is a founding member of OneRepublic!

"The Bright Side" contains everything you need to immerse yourself in the world of Christmas.

The bells are omnipresent in the song, and the good humor too.

Well, of course, it's still a bit early, but it makes you want to make a tree!

Available on iTunes on the compilation "iHeart the Holidays, Vol.2: A Very Alternative Christmas".
