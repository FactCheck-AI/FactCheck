With style worthy of the highest of English Indie kings, Southern Californian native Tim Myers sites John Lennon to The Flaming Lips as influences.

Music has been a presence in Myers life since an early age, being compelled by piano at five and mastering classical piano by thirteen. Guitar and bass were introduced to him by age fourteen, which lead him to play in several bands and collaborate with several artists living in Los Angeles.

In 2002 Myers joined the Interscope/Geffen Records band Limousine. In 2003 Myers decided to joined the chart topping band OneRepublic with front man Ryan Tedder. OneRepublic received a record deal with Columbia Records and quickly entered the studio with Producer Greg Wells. Myers wrote and performed on several songs on the debut record and left the band in 2007 to pursue a solo career.

Tracks from his soon to debut record have been heard on TV shows such as ABC's Grey's Anatomy and Lifetime's top rated show, Army Wives. Myers songs can also be heard in films such as Sony Pictures, The Water Horse: Legend Of The Deep starring Emily Watson. He also has composed music to artsy Indie films such as For Christ Sake, Border Lost and A Downward Spiral.

With his obsession with songwriting and experimenting in the studio, Myers continues to write at least 3 songs a week.
