A successful first Away Day for the National Oceanography Centre Digital Ocean group in Liverpool. Some thought provoking discussions reflecting on where we've come from, where we are now and where we'd like to be in the future!

The BODC Published Data Library (PDL) is a catalogue of datasets which have been assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). We work with scientists to create a data management plan at the beginning of a project and agree which data will have a DOI. Assigning DOI's makes the data more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable (FAIR). Not all data held at BODC have been allocated DOIs. The data within a DOI are freely available.

Marine rock samples collected by dredge or remotely operated vehicles (ROV) are an exceptional resource of immense scientific value which help inform geoscience research and contribute to the NERC: Natural Environment Research Council research areas including Earth resources, mantle and core processes, physics & chemistry of Earth materials and volcanic processes. Currently, there is no repository for marine rock samples collected by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded scientists and research ships so a Rock Store Working Group, involving the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), the British Geological Survey, the British Antarctic Survey, the University of Southampton, University of Strathclyde, The University of Edinburgh and The University of Manchester are inviting the UK’s marine science community to complete a survey which will help define the future requirements for marine dredge rock and ROV rock samples facilities. Results will be provided to the NOC Association of Marine Science National Capability Beneficiaries to consider next steps. The survey is open to UKRI-NERC funded scientists and the closing date for responses is 18 December 2024. Complete the survey 👇 https://bit.ly/4dgWcUv

The Seabed 2030 Global Center, hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre, have released the GEBCO_2024 global bathymetric grid. 🗺 This is a collaborative project between The Nippon Foundation and GEBCO - General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans - operating under the joint auspices of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) and the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO Ocean. 🌊 An estimated 26.1% of the seafloor is now mapped, up from 6% in 2017 🌊 Download the new release here ➡ https://lnkd.in/ggtuGriK #oceanmapping #marinedata #bathymetry #GEBCO

BODC will be exhibiting our marine data stand at the 'Archwiliwch ein planed - Explore our planet' event to raise awareness of the importance of marine data management. 📊 🌊 Come along to find out more and get your questions answered. See you there!

We have established a new robust workflow for archiving and publishing high volume data on CEDA (Centre for Environmental Data Analysis). CEDA is one of the NERC Environmental Data Centres and is the national data centre for atmospheric and earth observation research. 🌍 📊 Read in more detail about our collaborative project with CEDA here ➡: https://lnkd.in/gCjHW8MB #marinedatasharing #HVdata
