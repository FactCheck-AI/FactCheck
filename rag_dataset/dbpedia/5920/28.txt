The Hungry Horse Reservoir is a marvel of natural beauty, spanning 34 miles and surrounded by more than 25 breathtaking mountain peaks.

The Hungry Horse dam, completed in 1953, was designed to provide hydroelectric power, but it is the reservoir that draws locals. Many come to camp, swim, boat, paddle board or water ski. Others come for to fish for whitefish, cutthroat trout and bull trout. The Hungry Horse visitor center generally opens on Memorial Day weekend and remains open through Labor Day.
