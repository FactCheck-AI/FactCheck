Pennsylvania-born Victor Schertzinger trained as a violinist and toured internationally, then became a symphonic conductor. His first film credit was for composing the orchestral accompaniment for Civilization (1915). He directed Charles Ray films, among others, during the silent era. He went back to composing when talkies came in, with many credits throughout the '30s, ending with The Fleet's In (1942), which appeared posthumously after his sudden death in 1941. This superb score included four hit songs, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. He also directed films during this era, including the sumptuous British production of The Mikado (1939) in Technicolor, which stands the test of time to this day. He also had close directorial relationships with James Cagney, Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. He was unusually well-liked, and known for getting along with everyone.
