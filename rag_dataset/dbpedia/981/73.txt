Tidings, glad tid­ings un­to the world,

Tidings that an­gels loud­ly pro­claim,

Judea’s plains the mes­sage have heard:

Jesus is come to reign.

Refrain

Shepherds shout upon the dist­ant plain,

Angels send the ec­ho back again;

List to the chor­us, what does it say?

Jesus, Je­sus, Je­sus is born to­day.

Low in a man­ger, low in a stall,

See where the in­fant Sav­ior is born,

Maker and mon­arch, Sav­ior of all,

Know ye this Christ­mas morn!

Refrain

Let ev­ery heart beat glad and rejoice;

Let every soul be hap­py today.

Join in the chor­us, each, every voice,

Spread wide the cheer­ing ray.
