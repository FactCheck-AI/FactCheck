Tenor saxophonist David Murray has a mighty sound and an open mind. He has linked his soulful free jazz style to, among others, a gipsy ensemble and a Latin big band. Following the great success of his previous project, ‘Nat King Cole En Español’, Murray will come to the Bimhuis with three top musicians from New York and a brand new repertoire. Black Music Infinity is inspired by the forward-thinking New York loft jazz scene, which Murray was part of in the 1970s.
