Ars Nova Workshop is pleased to present the return of saxophone giant David Murray, one of the most prolific and celebrated jazz musicians of the last half-century. He’ll play Solar Myth for two nights with his trio featuring bassist Luke Stewart and drummer Russell Carter.

Known for his torrential sound and unflagging adventurousness, David Murray emerged from the 70s loft jazz scene to achieve elder status. He has released over 200 albums under his own name, working with the likes of Max Roach, Pharoah Sanders, McCoy Tyner, Taj Mahal, Amiri Baraka, Jerry Garcia, Doudou N’daye Rose, Cassandra Wilson, Omara Portuando, and The Roots, to name a few. He is also a founding member of the groundbreaking World Saxophone Quartet, which toured and recorded for 40 years. Even in his freest improvisatory flights, Murray’s era-spanning style acknowledges the gravity of a tradition he honors more than most, combining all the influences he grew out of: gospel, free jazz, rhythm’n blues, R&B and poetry. The great Cecil Taylor compared him to his greatest predecessors and their signature sounds: “You stick your ear in the door, you know it’s David!’’
