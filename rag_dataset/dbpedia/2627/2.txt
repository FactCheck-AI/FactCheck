Every year in June, the park hosts the LebensArt fair, which is very popular with visitors. The castle pond is open to the public on weekends during the summer.

The park is freely accessible.

Park history

The park is located in the historical center of Gro√üharthau. Its history is closely connected with the Saxon court of the 18th century. Countess von Fleming, who commissioned the park, richly decorated it with sculptures, fountains and greenhouses.

In the XIX century the park was embellished and then reconstructed in the neo-baroque style. It is worth mentioning the Baroque layout of the garden in the form of three terraces, characterized by a large lawn with Permian figures and an 8-meter-high fountain, as well as Baroque alleys lined with lime trees.

There used to be a castle (with a fortress) on the island in the middle of the park. However, it was severely destroyed by fire in early 1946 and was demolished to its foundations in the following years.
