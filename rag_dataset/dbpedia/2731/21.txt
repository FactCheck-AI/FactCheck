Maradonna-A true genuine representation of the maestro himself. - Maradona by Kusturica review by MB

If ever the Sun or Mail did a representation of this great man, they would disgorge themselves of all that is of the dark side regarding this great indidual, who is nobody's fool! and is certainly cognisant of how being poor is political, eg; the demon relating to all of the poverty that exists in South American countries, is at the behest of that behemoth monster of world wide terrorism's dark corporate war business's of that cess-pit usa.

Great Film from every respect by this of real master of genuine art house films, THE MAN IS >>>>>Emir Kusterica; he knows where it's @!
