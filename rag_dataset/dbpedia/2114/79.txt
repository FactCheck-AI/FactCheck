Rock, Paper, Scissors is an American animated buddy comedy television series created by Kyle Stegina and Josh Lehrman (who were also the creators of Disney Channel's Bizaardvark). It is the fifty-fifth major Nicktoon based on the classic playground game of the same name. The show was the first to get the greenlight out of Nickelodeon's Intergalactic Shorts program, which was established to scout out pitches from underrepresented talent. The series was officially greenlit by Nickelodeon on November 1, 2021, and the pilot episode premiered August 19, 2023. It was also shown as an exclusive look sneak peek of the series during the 2023 NFL Nickmas Games on December 25. The series premiered on Nickelodeon on February 12, 2024.[2]

Plot[]

The series follows the hilarious shenanigans of roommates Rock, Paper, and Scissors on their hijinks and ridiculous adventures, and no matter how much they compete and mess with each other, at the end of the day, they will always bond over their shared love of one thing: wacky nonsense.

Production[]

After graduating from the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television in 2008, Josh Lehrman worked on Family Guy, Brickleberry, and Robot Chicken. During these gigs, Lehrman tried to come up with his own show ideas. Thankfully, he and his writing partner Kyle Stegina would soon receive professional help with their ideas. Lehrman and Stegina's managers submitted applications to the Disney Channel's Storytellers program in 2014, and their applications were accepted.

During the Storytellers program, Lehrman and Stegina developed what would later become their three-season Disney series Bizaardvark. After the third season wrapped, Lehrman discovered an opportunity at the competing channel Nickelodeon: the Intergalactic Shorts program. The program was "searching for new and diverse creators from across the globe, focusing on new voices and nurturing their vision for original comedy-driven content with an eye toward representation." Lehrman paired up with Stegina once again to pitch "Rock, Paper, Scissors" as part of the program.

"We knew we were onto something special with creators Kyle Stegina and Josh Lehrman and their hilarious characters in Rock, Paper, Scissors, which we are so proud to bring to series," said Nickelodeon Animation head Ramsey Naito. "Finding and growing talent through the process of pitch to hit is what powers our Intergalactic Shorts program, and we can't wait to get started finding the next great creator in animation through our program's just-launched second phase."

The full pilot episode was released on August 19, 2023 on the Nicktoons YouTube channel.[3] Soon after, various other clips from the show, as well as the full episodes "Birthday Police" and "Paper's Big Lie" would be released on the channel. Nickelodeon's YouTube channel also uploaded a special interview episode: "Lights, Camera, Rock, Paper, Scissors!" on February 11, 2024.[4]
