After his December 7th nomination as President-elect Barack Obama’s Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Retired Army Gen. Eric Shinseki became living proof that one President’s trash can be another President’s treasure. The decorated veteran is most remembered for his controversial role as Army Chief of Staff in the Bush Administration. His testimony in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee regarding the need for several hundred thousand troops in Iraq was challenged and dismissed as “wildly off the mark” by the Department of Defense. Spoiler alert: Shinseki ended up being right, but his public dissent of the Administration’s estimate irreparably strained his relationship with his superiors. He unceremoniously retired in June 2003.

Quotes from:
