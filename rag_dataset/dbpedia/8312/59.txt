A pair of 12-year-old runaways, who hadnâ€™t been seen since leaving Carver Middle School in South Los Angeles late last week, were located today and reunited with their families, police said.

Iris Vanessa Rodriguez and Sonia Gonzalez, who were last seen jumping a fence at the school to meet with friends on Friday, were found by juvenile officers about 11 a.m. at a home in Los Angeles, according a Los Angeles Police Department statement.

The girls were unharmed and safely returned to their families, according to police, who did not elaborate on where the girls had been since disappearing.
