Lita Ford is the former lead guitarist of The Runaways, an all-girl hard rock band from Los Angeles in the mid-to-late 1970s, as well as a platinum-selling solo musician. Elle magazine has named her one of the twelve greatest female guitarists. Visit her website.

In this long-awaited, emotionally powerful memoir, “Heavy Metal’s leading female rocker” (Rolling Stone) opens up about the ’70s and ’80s music scene and her trailblazing life as the lead guitarist of the “pioneering band” (New York Times), the Runaways and her platinum-selling, Grammy-nominated solo career. Hailed as “the mother of all metal” (Los Angeles Times) and “one of the greatest female electric guitar players to ever pick up the instrument” (Elle), Lita Ford bares her soul in Living Like a Runaway.
