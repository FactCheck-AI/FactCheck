The American Academy in Rome honored the filmmaker and screenwriter Sofia Coppola at the McKim Medal Gala on June 5, 2024. The sold-out evening raised over $900,000 to support AAR and its fellowships.

We are deeply grateful to our faithful supporters who have, once again, ensured that the gala was a success.

The American Academy in Rome will hold the next McKim Medal Gala in June 2025.

This year’s honoree is Sofia Coppola, presented by Rachel Feinstein.

One of the highest-profile cultural events of the social calendar in Rome, the annual McKim Medal Gala honors individuals whose work internationally, most particularly in Italy and in the United States, has contributed significantly to the arts and humanities, and whose life exemplifies creative and intellectual exchange across the arts, scholarship, language, and culture.

Proceeds from the evening support Academy programs and American, Italian, and international artists and scholars, providing them with important opportunities to pursue their individual studies, to participate in and contribute to international discourse in their fields and disciplines, and to gain experience that will be invaluable throughout their careers.
