Ahead of Danny Brown‘s fourth album Atrocity Exhibition that drops next week, the Detroit emcee has dropped a massive collaboration with Kendrick Lamar, Earl Sweatshirt and Ab-Soul called “Really Doe.”

Danny Brown Drops Menacing New Single ‘Pneumonia’ From ‘Atrocity Exhibition’

The track revolves around an eerie melody played on what sounds like a child’s xylophone, while Brown and his posse attack the beat, taking tuns on the verses while Lamar lays down the hook: “They say I got the city on fire/ I ain’t boomin’, that’s a goodamn lie/ Woah, really doe like really doe/ Really doe like really doe.”

Brown recently told NPR (via MTV) how the track came together: “Me and Kendrick always talked about doing stuff, and I had the idea to get K Dot and Earl together… but first I got me and Ab Soul. And then one day when I was mixing the album with Ali, K Dot snuck in and just laced it. I had to be patient and wait on Earl, but it was all worth it you know because hip-hop needs that posse cut. We just wanna make the best possible song ‘cause we know the hype on paper. I know it’s gonna satisfy, my feet is up.”
