Paul du Bois-Reymond Franz Neumann Hankel . Finally he was appointed to a chair in Berlin. His work is almost exclusively on calculus, in particular differential equations and functions of a real variable. He generalised Monge 's idea of the characteristic of a partial differential equation from 2nd order equations to nth order equations. This work formed a basis of what Lie was to generalise later. In 1873 he gave a continuous function with divergent Fourier series at any point solving a major problem. The term ' integral equation ' is due to Du Bois-Reymond.

Subject: [HM] Paul du Bois-Reymond Author: dmccarty@cs.indiana.edu Date: Thu, 25 Jan 2001 12:28:36 -0500 (EST) PAUL DU BOIS-REYMOND I would be very grateful to receive information on archival materials (correspondence, unpublished papers, notes, scientific Nachlass) related to the thought and career of 19 Century mathematician/philosopher Paul du Bois-Reymond (1831 - 1889) who held academic posts in Heidelberg, Freiburg, Tuebingen and Berlin. I have it on good authority that Du Bois-Reymond's own Nachlass, at the TU Berlin, was, most likely, destroyed during WWII. Replies to D.C. McCarty at dmccarty@indiana.edu Thanks very much for your kindness and consideration, D.C. McCarty The Math Forum
