ANCESTORS of JUANITA FREDERICK

Descendants of Nicolas Prevost and Ives Dubo

Generation No. 1

JF1.NICOLAS1 PREVOST was born Abt. 1700 in La Rochelle, France1, and died Bef. January 1762 in LA2. He married IVES DUBO 17233, daughter of RENE DUBOT and ELIZABETH DUVAL. She was born Abt. 17064.

Notes for NICOLAS PREVOST:

Although some sources show a second wife, Marie-Therese BERTRAND, for Nicolas PREVOST, he was still married to Ives DUBOS in 1745. A Nicolas PREVOST from Boulogne, France, married Marie-Therese BERTRAND in New Orleans in 1732; this is Nicolas PROVOST dit BLONDIN. Nicolas PREVOST married to Ives DUBOS is apparently not the son of Claude PROVOST and Marie RORNIE.

Notes for MADELEINE PREVOST:

In the marriage record, Madeleine is simply given as "Madeleine of Pointe Coupee", with no parent names. The birth of Madeleine PREVOST is listed in the Pointe Coupee records under Madeleine COLLETTE, born to Joseph PREVOST dit COLLETTE and Madeleine MAYEUX. Madeleine MAYEUX, wife of Joseph PREVOST, died about 10 days after giving birth to Madeleine. I have no proof that this is the same Madeleine PREVOST who married Antoine BONIN, but given the ties between the PREVOST and BONIN families (Francois PREVOST married Genevieve BONIN), I am reasonably confident of my assignment. But there is room for error here.

Notes for MANETTE PREVOST:

This reference actually is to the death of "Mrs. Eugene Borel", who died at age over 60 years. I have surmised it is the same as Manette PREVOST, but it is not certain.

Child of MANETTE PREVOST and EUGENE BOREL is given in Descendants of Pierre BOREL.
