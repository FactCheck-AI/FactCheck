The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, or simply the S&P 500, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 503 large-cap U.S. stocks. The index accounts for 80% of the market value of the U.S. equities market. Because it reflects nearly all of the largest stocks in the U.S., it is often regarded as synonymous with the market as a whole. It's the closest there is to a default U.S. stock index.

Because it's weighted by market cap, the largest stocks have a big impact on both the long-term performance and daily movement of the index. The 10 biggest stocks make up 30.9% of the index's market value as of Aug. 31, 2023. This means that investors should familiarize themselves with these 10 giant components to understand what drives the broader market.

Below is our analysis of the 10 largest components of the S&P 500. Weightings are as of Sept. 22, 2023, and market capitalizations are as of Sept. 25, 2023.
