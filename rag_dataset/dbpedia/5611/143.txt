Larry Miller has one of those Hollywood faces that you recognize instantly, even if you can’t always remember all of his credits or even his name. But with more than 100 film and TV credits on his resume, Miller has made a career of sometimes short but memorable roles on screen in Pretty Woman, Ten Things I Hate About You, The Nutty Professor, Boston Legal, Seinfeld, Law and Order, Desperate Housewives, and as a member of the ensemble in Christopher Guest’s masterpieces Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, For Your Consideration and Waiting For Guffman, to name a few.

Miller is a renaissance man: a standup comedian with HBO specials, a Broadway stage actor, a podcast host of This Week with Larry Miller, a humorist who has published in The Huffington Post, Maxim, The Weekly Standard, and the author of the 2006 book Spoiled Rotten America. His one-man show, Cocktails With Larry Miller, still tours as well.

Larry Miller performs his stand-up act at the Paramount Theatre in Middletown Oct. 26.
