​Thelma Schoonmaker has joked with Martin Scorsese about destroying GoodFella's..."Everybody want's their films edited like that!"

​She has worked with him since the early 80's

She goes on to talk about the editing in the final few scenes.

"Martin had planned the soundtrack to coincide with different scenes..."

Thelma talked about the scene when Liotta is so busy looking at helicopters he nearly crashed - and Scorsese chose The Who for this sequence.

"Every thing was tight, all the cuts and frames, but because of Henry Hill's coke psychosis we could speed it up, jump cut.... "

You can hear the whole thing on the Film Prog Radio 4, i'll put a link.

GoodFellas is re released at a cinema near you this weekend. 20th Jan - Go and revisit it.
