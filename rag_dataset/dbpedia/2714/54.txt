Collier Logging Museum is Oregon’s and perhaps the nation’s foremost historic logging museum, and is located in southern central Oregon just north of Klamath Falls on Highway 97 near the town of Chiloquin at the Collier Memorial State Park.

This free museum tells the history of logging in Oregon including cutting, moving and milling from the 1860s to the present.

The museum, which was started in 1947, occupies 147 acres, and can be toured in about an hour.

The timber industry was the main driving force in Oregon’s economy for 130 years until about 1990 as Oregon produced more wood products than any other U.S. state.
