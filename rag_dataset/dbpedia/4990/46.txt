Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Information:

The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge was one of the most anticipated devices of 2015, as it's usually the case with Samsung flagship line, but the company decided to release two Galaxy S6 flagships in March 2015. The Galaxy S6 Edge was announced alongside the Galaxy S6, and left a really great first impression on people. These two devices feature more or less the same specifications on the inside, but are visibly different on the outside. The Galaxy S6 Edge, unlike the Galaxy S6, sports a curved display on both its left and right side. These curves actually make the device look really sleek and elegant, which only brings out the premium look here. The Galaxy S6 Edge is also made out of metal, and it sports a unibody build. The software is also the same as in the Galaxy S6, with the addition of a couple of extra features which take advantage of those curves on the sides.

The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge sports a 5.1-inch QuadHD (2560 x 1440) Super AMOLED display, 3GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 32GB, 64GB or 128GB of non-expandable internal storage. Samsung's proprietary 14nm Exynos 7420 64-bit octa-core processor powers on this handset along with Mali-T760 GPU for graphics. A 2,600mAh non-removable battery is here to make sure you get enough screen on time before you have to charge it. 16-megapixel OIS camera is located on the back of the Galaxy S6 Edge, and is flanked by an LED flash, while a 5-megapixel shooter is available on this device's front side for selfies and video calls. Android 5.0.2 Lollipop comes pre-installed on the Galaxy S6 Edge with Samsung's TouchWiz UI on top of Google's operating system. 143.4 x 70.5 x 6.8mm are the dimensions of this device, and it weighs 138 grams.

Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge Editor Rating:

The Galaxy S6 Edge is a pleasant surprise by Samsung. The company certainly didn't want to release this thing as their only flagship this time around, but the S6 Edge might turn out to be a success. Those curved sides contribute to the overall sleek look of the device, and when you're pulling out a sidebar or anything of the sort, you get a really nice effect due to that curve on the side. There are a couple of Edge features in the software itself, some of which are arguably even useful, but I do believe that the looks is the key here. The Galaxy S6 Edge certainly look sleeker than the regular S6, though some people might not think so. Either way, this is an improvement over the Galaxy Note Edge which sported only 1 curve and looked quite odd because of it. It will be interesting to see how many Galaxy S6 Edge units will Samsung will be able to push out this year.
