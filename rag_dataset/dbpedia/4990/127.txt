Korean electronics maker Samsung announced its Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge today in Barcelona. The phones are set to launch in tandem with Samsung's new mobile payment service, Samsung Pay. According to Samsung, the new design required "first-of-its-kind glass crafting technology," with screens made of Corning's newest Gorilla Glass 4. Today's announcement verifies a leak earlier in the month which said Samsung would release two new versions of the S6. The all metal and glass phones will come in 32, 64, and 128GB models and have a 577ppi display, which puts it just above the Galaxy S5 as far as pixel density is concerned. Powering the phone is a 14nm Octacore application processor running Android Lollipop. The phone features a 16MP rear and 5MP front-facing camera at f/1.9, which means it's wide-open for low light capabilities.

"By listening to our customers, and learning from both our success and missteps, we continuously push forward new technologies and ideas," said Samsung's CEO and head of IT & mobile communications division JK Shin.

Samsung's new pay service,Samsung Pay, promises to be "compatible with more locations than any competing offering in a single application," which is clearly a jab at Apple Pay, which was announced in the fall of 2014. Samsung Pay and the S6 and S6 edge will release April 10. Seth Macy is a freelance writer who does a podcast about MST3K Follow him on Twitter @sethmacy, and MyIGN at sethgmacy.
