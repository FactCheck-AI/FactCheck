title = {Primeval adiabatic perturbatinos: effect of massive neutrinos},

author = {Peebles, P J.E.},

abstractNote = {The autocorrelation function of the mass distribution prior to galaxy formation is computed under the assumptions that the university is dominated now by neutrinos with mass some tens of eV and that the primeval density fluctuations are adiabatic and linear, deltarho/rho<1. The computation includes the massive neutrinos, zero-mass weakly interacting particles, ordinary matter, and radiation. The distribution of massive neutrinos is computed as a function of the magnitude and direction of the momentum. Matter and radiation are treated as a single ideal fluid. The coherence length lambdaJ of the mass distribution prior to galaxy formation may be compared to the present clustering length of galaxies. In the conventional scenario the coherence length is uncomfortably large unless the universe is quite dense, ..cap omega..happrox.1 (..cap omega.. = density parameter, H = 100h km s/sup -1/ Mpc/sup -1/), and the initial spectrum of density flutuations is steep, Vertical Bardelta/sub k/Vertical Bar/sup 2/proportionalk/sup n/,n> or approx. =2.},
