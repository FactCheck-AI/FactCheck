ABC has set the competitors for its anticipated revival of Battle of the Network stars. 100 stars from 14 network and cable companies and series, such as Modern Family, Pretty Little Liars, Scandal, among others, will compete with Super Bowl 50 winner DeMarcus Ware and MMA fighter/Olympian Ronda Rousey as team captains. Many of the stars, including Donna Mills, Todd Bridges and Lou Ferrigno, competed in the original series and are returning for the revival.

The original series from ABC Sports began in 1976 and continued for 13 years. The 10-episode summer event, set at Pepperdine University in Malibu, will pit teams of current and classic TV stars from multiple eras and different genres against one another in a variety of athletic games. Fielding of the teams will be based on the TV characters from over the years to the current day – cops vs. TV sitcoms, White House vs. lawyers, TV moms & dads vs. TV kids, etc. ESPN’s Mike Greenberg and Joe Tessitore will host, and Cassidy Hubbarth and Cari Champion are the sideline reporters.
