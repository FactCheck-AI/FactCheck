Ann Street, Brisbane.

This is an exceptional example of a Classical Revival building with its huge fluted Corinthian columns. It was designed by Lange Powell, himself a mason, and has been the centre of Queensland's masonic activities.

According to Bill MacMahon in his excellent book, 'Architecture of East Australia', this is a "wonderful building which presents to the street a dignified and slightly mysterious air."
