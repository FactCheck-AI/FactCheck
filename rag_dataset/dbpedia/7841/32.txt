Located in the heart of Buffalo’s historic Elmwood Village, Nardin Academy is the oldest, independent Catholic school in Western New York. Founded in 1857 by the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, Nardin provides each student with the highest standards in academics, athletics, and the arts, while fostering a deep commitment to service.

True to Nardin’s value of embracing all, Nardin supports the well-being of each student and promotes educating the whole child. With world-class facilities, including a new gymnasium, outdoor athletic fields, and robust spaces for the arts, our students discover their passions and all that Nardin has to offer to reach their true potential.

As you start your educational journey, I would like to welcome you to our school. Deciding on an academic institution is one of the most important decisions a family can make. The Admissions Team and I are here to partner with you as you start this journey and discover the Nardin Difference.

From our youngest Montessori students to our high school graduates, Nardin students in our coed Montessori, Lower, and Middle Schools and all-girl High School lead with confidence, strength, and integrity. They are curious and critical learners who champion equity and justice. At Nardin, students grow in their faith and spirituality as they serve others with humility and compassion.

Our balance of tradition and innovation sets us apart. Your child will experience a dynamic Nardin community that maximizes the true potential of our students by engaging them in the world to create a better and more meaningful future.

We look forward to hearing from you and encourage you to reach out to the Admissions Team at admissions@nardin.org so we can start our journey together.
