Thomas Pendleton was my seventh great-grandfather. He was born January 3, 1717 in Westerly, Rhode Island – the son of James Pendleton and Elizabeth (Brown) Pendleton.

He was raised in Westerly with his three brothers and four sisters – Obadiah (1712-1729), Christopher (1715-1740), Elizabeth (1715-1729), Thankful (1725-1780), Read (1728 -1746), Hannah (1731-1828) and Roth (1734 – ?).

On October 21, 1743, he married Dorcas Dodge in New Shoreham (Block Island), Rhode Island. Dorcas was the daughter of Nathaniel and Margaret (Pullins) Dodge of Block Island, Newport, Rhode Island.

In a biography of the Pendletons, the following is written:

“Captain Thomas Pendleton. On 18 Mar 1742/42, “Caleb Pendelton, grandfather, and James Pendleton, father,” deeded to Thomas 300 acres of land in Westerly. Tradition says that Thomas was a whaler-man, and that on one of his voyages to Greenland, he put in at Castine, where, excited by the beauty of the Penobscot Bay region, he determined to settle. He removed to what is now Isleboro, Maine, a few years before the Revolution, and when he had established himself there, he brought his entire family there, with the exception of his son Nathaniel, who followed later. At the first town hall meeting of Isleboro on 6 Apr 1789, he was elected surveyor of highways.”

Dorcas gave Thomas eleven children. Mark (1742-1762), Stephen (1743-1753), Samuel (1745-1826), Thomas Jr. (1746-1812), Margaret (1748-1833), Gideon (1751-1847), Joshua (1755-1844), Nathaniel (1757-1833), Mary (1758-1847), Mark (1760-1779), Stephen (the second) (1763-1845).

It is said in the book on Brian Pendleton that he died about 1809, “probably at Deer Island, NB while on a visit to his sons.”

In 1753 Thomas Pendleton acted as executor of his father’s will, and on the 6th of July in that year he sold his property in Westerly, and on teh same day bought from his half-brother, James Pendleton Jr., land in Stonington, Connecticut for 1200 pounds. This property he sold to John Randall Jr. on 28th January, 1756 and on the same day bought of Thomas Noyes, Jr. land at Pawcatuck.

Tradition says that Thomas Pendleton was a whalerman, and thatn on one of his voyages to Greenland he put in at Castine, Maine, where hexcited by the beauty of the Penobscot Bay region, he determined to settle. In the probating of Col. Joseph Pendleton’s estate, 1761, he received 101 pounds which may have been due him as the master of one of the Colonel’s vessels. At any rate, he removed to what is now Islesboro, Maine a few years before the Revolution, and when he had established himself there, he brought his entire family to the island, with the exception of his son, Nathaniel, who followed later.

The records of the Court of Common Pleas for Washington County, Rhode Island show that Thomas Pendleton, “mariner”, was engaged in various law-suits in Rhode Island from August 1769, to August, 1771 and that his residence in the former year was at Stonington, and in 1770 and 1771 at Westerly. These facts would indicate that Thomas did not locate at Isleboro as early as has been generally supposed. He may of course have taken up land there before this as a preliminary towards making a settlement, but the actual date of his leaving the old home of the family must have been later than August 1771.
