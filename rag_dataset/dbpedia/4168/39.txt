Here’s my Remix of "When Lightning Strikes Twice" which is also a teaser from of the album ‘49North - Phase 1: Distilled & Amplified’ LP ‘Side B: Stratosphere’ that will be released on February 3rd.

11 mins 38 seconds of pure indulgence definitely one for warmer times (at least in the UK) hope it brings the sun out enjoy!
