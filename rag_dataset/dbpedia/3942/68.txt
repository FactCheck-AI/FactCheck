This 2010 documentary is essentially an oral history from some of those who were at the Stonewall Inn on the night of the police raid that sparked a rebellion. Through interviews with patrons, activists, journalists and even the police inspector who led the raid, the film offers some context on the social climate and attitudes toward the LGBTQ community during that time.

It then gets more specific about the events preceding and following the uprising, when LGBTQ people finally pushed back against the police and started a movement. Some of the language is a bit out of date, and there is a noticeable lack of diversity in the voices represented, but it’s a good starting point to learn about the event.

Also worth checking out is comedian Crissle West’s retelling of the story in an episode from “Drunk History.” This segment centers the story on Marsha P. Johnson, one of the trans women of color at the forefront of the event.
