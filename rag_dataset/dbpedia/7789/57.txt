Hamidiye regiments were formed in 1891 such as getting to their goals based on utilization of tribal volunteers force against external attacks, controlling of Kurdish tribes and inhibiting Armenians to be abused. Mustafa Pasha was one of the regional commanders and the leader of Miran Tribe, served and took part with his tribe in these regiments, later promoted to army rank of pasha. Mustafa Pasha to be in conflict with the other tribes in the region, extortion and murders committed was a negative precedent that has been constantly complained. Indicted for the crimes he committed, but he has not been on trial because of support and patronage of the 4th Army Commander (Müşir), Zeki Pasha. Failure of Mustafa Pasha to comply with the law and acting in himself irresponsibly led to a subject of discussion of Hamidiye Regiments. Continuous complaints were made about him from 1892 until about the year 1902 he was killed in a combat.
