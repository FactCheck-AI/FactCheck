Azerbaijan won the first medal at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympic Games.

Hidayat Heydarov was the owner of the first gold medal in the French capital, as per Idman.biz.

The World Judo Champion (-73 kg) stood out on the third day of the Olympics. He exploded Paris after 174 years since Mirza Fatali Akhundov's Mastali Shah in 1850.

Hidayat also repeated the joint record of Elnur Mammadli and Rustam Orujov, who won the earliest Olympic medals from Azerbaijan. All three judokas reached the finals in the 73 kg category. Mammadli became the champion in Beijing 2008, Heydarov in Paris 2024, while Orujov settled for silver in Rio 2016.

Hidayat started fighting from the round of 16 and scooped up the gold medal. Joan-Benjamin Gaba of France took the silver, while Adil Osmanov of Moldova and Soichi Hashimoto of Japan earlier won bronze medals.
