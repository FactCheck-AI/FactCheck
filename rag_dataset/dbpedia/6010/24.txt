The Timurid Empire covered west, south and central Asia and was founded by Timur (sometimes referred to as Tamerlane) during his reign from 1370 to 1405. It developed out of the shadows of the Mongol Empire, as disputes between leading tribal khans tore apart any remaining Mongol unity and allowed Timur to emerge as a new leader of a reconstructed empire. After his death however, he left no clear line of succession, and his conglomeration of states and tribal territories fell apart.
