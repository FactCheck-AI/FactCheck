The Pannonia Valeria or simply Valeria, also known as Pannonia Ripensis, was one of the provinces of the Roman Empire. It was formed in the year 296, during the reign of emperor Diocletian, in a division of Pannonia Inferior. The capital of the province was Sopianae (today PÃ©cs). Pannonia Valeria included parts of present-day Hungary and Croatia.

The province continued as an entity under the rule of the Huns until the rise of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths in the 5th century.
