This gorgeous highway winds along Californiaâs coast and features some of the most jaw-dropping sights and picturesque towns youâve ever seen. This flexible tour takes you south from San Francisco to Los Angeles or north from Los Angeles to San Francisco in four scenic segments:

San Francisco to Monterey:

Cruise down the most beautiful roadway in the world while getting a taste of the west coast way of life. Discover stunning ocean vistas, learn the fascinating history behind towns like Santa Cruz, and find your literary muse in the artsy haven of Monterey.

The 17-Mile Drive:

Big Sur (Monterey to San Luis Obispo):

Imagine hitting the open road. Rolling the windows down, listening to crashing waves as an ocean breeze tousles your hair, and just... driving. Stopping to visit a little coastal village, sampling the freshest seafood you've ever tasted, and watching the sun set over the deep blue Pacific. Itâs not just the stuff of daydreams, itâs a real place called Big Sur!

San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles:
