The time difference between Phuket, Thailand and Spain varies depending on the standard time in Spain and whether or not Thailand is observing daylight saving time.

Spain has two main time zones: peninsular english time (CET, Central European Time) and island english time (WET, Western European Time) for the Canary Islands. On the other hand, Thailand is in the Indochina Time Zone (ICT, Indochina Time).

Here are the typical time differences between Phuket and Spain:

Mainland Spain (CET) and Thailand (ICT): Phuket is approximately 6 hours ahead of mainland Spain.

Canary Islands (WET) and Thailand (ICT): Phuket is approximately 7 hours ahead of the Canary Islands.

It is important to note that Spain observes daylight saving time, while Thailand does not. Therefore, during the months when Spain moves forward one hour for daylight saving time, the time difference is reduced by one hour. For example, when Spain is on Daylight Saving Time (CEST, Central European Summer Time), the time difference between Phuket and mainland Spain is approximately 5 hours, and between Phuket and the Canary Islands, it is approximately 6 hours.

It is essential to check the current time in both locations before making international plans or communicating with people on the other side of the world, as daylight saving time rules can change and affect the time difference.
