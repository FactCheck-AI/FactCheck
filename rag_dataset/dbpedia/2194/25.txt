Meet the Electro-Harmonix Hot Wax, a powerful dual-overdrive pedal that's a force to be reckoned with for both guitar and bass players. This beast merges the prowess of EHX's Hot Tubes and Crayon pedals, offering the flexibility of using each individually or stacking them for a supercharged overdrive experience.

Be in complete control with the Master EQ and Blend controls, allowing you to fine-tune your tone to your heart's desire. Whether you're looking for a subtle enhancement or a full-blown transformation, the Hot Wax is versatile enough to cater to your every whim.
