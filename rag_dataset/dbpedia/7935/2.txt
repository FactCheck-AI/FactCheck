JOHNSTOWN, Pa. ( ) – A Pennsylvania father is getting recognized after his rendition of the National Anthem was caught on camera Monday.

Mark Lux was in the stands watching his daughter's soccer game.

Generally, the National Anthem is played before all Johnstown sporting events, but Monday night, the person who usually plays the National Anthem was unavailable, Jayne Lynn tells WJAC.

Lynn was also in the stands for the game. She's the one who recorded Lux's performance.

"So, when they announced the anthem wouldn’t be played [Lux] jumped into action, said let’s sing and jumped up and began singing the National Anthem," Lynn said.

When asked why he thought it was important to sing the National Anthem, Lux said, "the National Anthem is a story of true Americans not giving up. That is the spirit that we continue to have today. Never give up on America."
