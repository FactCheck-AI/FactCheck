ABC’s Once Upon a Time is expanding its kingdom to the publishing realm with a new book series.

In what seems like a natural pairing for the show, Once Upon is debuting a fantasy novel from Disney-owned Hyperion books.

The first title in what may be a series of books is titled Reawakened (cover image above) and it’s novelization of the show’s first season and promises to give “fans of the show a whole new look at their favorite characters and stories.” The narrative will be told in alternating points-of-view—that of Emma Swan (portrayed by Jennifer Morrison in the show) in the real world of Storybrooke, and Snow White (Ginnifer Goodwin) in Fairy Tale Land. The novel is written by Odette Beane, and based upon the TV series by Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis.

ABC has engaged in book tie-ins before, such as for its detective series Castle.

Reawakened will be available first as an exclusive ebook on April 27, and then one week later in a paperback edition.
