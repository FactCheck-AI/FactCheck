The entertaining, imaginative series is a sharply written modern spin on fairy tales that combines drama, romance, and suspense in a truly magical way. Once Upon a Time brings together a wide range of favorite characters, including stand-bys like Red Riding Hood (Meghan Ory), Peter Pan (Robbie Kay), and Rumpelstiltskin (Robert Carlyle) and more contemporary characters like Merida (Amy Manson) and Princess Elsa (Georgina Haig). The story takes generous liberties with the content of the original narratives in order to allow viewers to engage with them in exciting new ways. Purists might take issue with this aspect of the show, but the formula allows for creative plot lines to drive the show through its seven seasons.

This isn't your kids' fairy tale collection, however, nor is it a suitable bedtime story for little ones. It's dark, intense, occasionally sexy, and at times too violent for younger kids. The constant plot twists and the characters' unpredictable motivations can be worrisome, too. It does, however, promise a fun experience for older viewers craving something outside the repetitive realm of sitcoms, dramas, and reality shows. Overall, Once Upon a Time is a fun journey that will have you rooting for underdogs, cheering for true love, and embracing a world that's as clever as it is enchanting.
