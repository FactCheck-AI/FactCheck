THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE, written by precocious American author Stephen Crane in 1895, is a short novel about an unnamed Civil War battle (based on the Battle of Chancellorsville, in which Crane's brother fought. It's told from the perspective of a young enlisted intellectual who's terrified that he may not be brave enough to stand and fight when the time comes. As the multi-day skirmish unfolds, "the youth" is confronted with mortal danger at every turn, throwing his fragile psyche into turmoil as he tries to prove his manly credentials and preserve his honor in the eyes of his peers. Fighting to survive, blinded by the fog of war, and boxed in by expectations of chivalry and masculinity, the young men of the regiment are tried and tested again and again, losing many to gunfire, until "the sultry nightmare was in the past."

Crane's evocative, stream-of-conscious descriptions of the emotional turbulence and all-around mayhem of battle is incredibly compelling. Henry is a dynamic main character capable of moments of laudable bravery as well as detestable egotism. The hazy morality of combat is a central theme, with Crane almost mocking the soldiers who continuously pat themselves on the back and assure themselves that they are becoming "men" by confronting the terror of the front lines. In reality, Crane is skewering these foolhardy notions of honor and courage, highlighting just how fickle and contradictory such characteristics can be. While The Red Badge of Courage does provide an illuminating depiction of the experience of a massive 19th-century battle, the true focus is on the internal conflicts people must face when swept up into the desperate and deadly maelstrom of war. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the Civil War, military history, or the development of American literature.
