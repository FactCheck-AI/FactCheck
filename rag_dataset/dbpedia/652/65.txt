The Dugong, known scientifically as Dugong dugon, is a marine mammal that is part of the order Sirenia, which includes three other types of manatees. Due to anthropogenic causes, the Dugong is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN and is the last remaining member of the Dugongidae family. The Dugongâs most recent relative was the Stellerâs sea cow, which was declared extinct in the 18th century. The Dugong can be found throughout the waters of the Indo-Pacific ocean grazing on seagrass. The Dugong, similar in body shape to other manatees, has no dorsal fins or hind limbs and has paddle shaped flippers; however, the Dugong has a fluked tail, which is more similar to a dolphin.
