Ilhan Ersahin alongside Dave Harrington and Kenny Wollesen, released a new single Even As You Smile, from the trio's forthcoming new album Invite Your Eye.

New York-based Swedish/Turkish saxophonist, composer, club-label owner Ilhan Ersahin together with drummer Kenny Wollesen (Tom Waits, John Zorn, Norah Jones) and Dave Harrington (of electronic duo Darkside) on guitar/bass/electronics, captures the vibe of impromptu, cross-pollinating, and heavily grooving late-night jam sessions at Ersahin's owned Nublu Jazz Club.

The telepathy and intuition that flows between these three musicians is one that has developed over many years of playing together in different combinations, and on a permanent regular basis at NYC's Nublu, searching and creating together in the moment. What they have come up with has evolved steadily over that time and its current form can be heard to brilliant effect on their new album "Invite Your Eye" which is due out on March 4th following three advance singles. The exploratory instrumental space-jazz these gentlemen purvey has many antecedents and influences but perhaps it's best not to cite names and instead let the music speak for itself. This sound and approach comes as naturally to them as breathing, hence the album title which is also the title of the first single.

Listen to Ilhan Ersahin, Dave Harrington, Kenny Wollesen new single Even As You Smile, from the trio's forthcoming new album Invite Your Eye:

Dave Harrington writes: The bones of this record were recorded during a late-night, graveyard shift session on one night in summer 2019 at Figure 8 Studios in Brooklyn. The three of us were used to playing at this hour anyway, most of our gigs as a trio being after-hours hits at Nublu that could easily go until 4am. So the setting was right for us to do what we always do, which is come in with a blank slate and improvise--creating from a shared language and history of improvised music and groove-based exploration.
