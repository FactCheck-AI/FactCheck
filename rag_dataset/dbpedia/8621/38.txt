Every family needs a home, somewhere to get together, to share meals, to rest and find the resources we all need to have a full and active life.

For the family of North and South Leith Parish Church home is our church building and our halls.

Our Church building is in the Kirkgate, in the heart of Leith, just through the Kirkgate shopping centre at the foot of Leith Walk. (Leith is the historic port for Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland). You can see the location on this map.

In this beautiful building we worship and praise God. We pray for ourselves, the community, and the world. We sing psalms, old and new hymns, and contemporary songs. We regularly sharing in the sacraments of Communion and Baptism. We celebrate our festivals of Harvest, Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. We remember the past, we enjoy the present and we look to the future with hope.
