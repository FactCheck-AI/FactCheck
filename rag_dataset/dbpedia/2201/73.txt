I've heard the definition of a "rimshot" to be both hitting the rim and head of a snare at the same time, and that "ba-dum CHING" sound after a lame joke. Is there a proper term for either one to differentiate between the two?

A rimshot is just a accent from the regular head. It gives you a louder crack when you hit the rim and head. The "ba-dum CHING" are just regular hits (I guess?) where you hit only on the drum head itself. Just another tool to your toolbox of sounds.

The joke thing isn't a rimshot. The first definition is the correct one, hitting head and rim.

RIM SHOT is the only term I know but I have heard another but can't remember what it is.

I've always wondered this myself.

Like when someone writes a joke like:

"What's brown and sticky? A stick (rimshot)."

"BA DOOMP CHING" isn't actually a rimshot. A rimshot is a "CRACK".
