The U.S. Courts hear cases over which they have jurisdiction granted by the U.S. Constitution or Congress. Learn more about the cases heard in federal courts in this section.

The federal courts have jurisdiction over

Cases that raise a "federal question" involving the United States Government , the U.S. Constitution, or other federal laws; and

Cases involving â€œdiversity of citizenship," which are disputes between two parties not from the same state or country, and where the claim meets a set dollar threshold for damages.

More specifically, federal courts hear criminal, civil, and bankruptcy cases. And once a case is decided, it can often be appealed.
