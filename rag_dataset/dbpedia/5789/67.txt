Modernist literature experimented with form and perspective to examine the human experience. Inception is a modernist science fiction film directed by Christopher Nolan that explores the themes of memory, reality, and the subconscious mind. The film depicts a process called "inception" where an idea is planted deep in a target's subconscious so that they believe it is their own idea. Like modernist literature, Inception uses psychological concepts and non-linear structures of time to examine what is real and what is a dream. It demonstrates how the subconscious can influence perceptions of reality.
