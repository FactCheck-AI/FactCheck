CHATWIN, Bruce. On the Black Hill – Uncorrected proof. London, Jonathan Cape, 1982.

Uncorrected proof of Chatwin’s novel set in a farm on the border between England and Wales.

On the Black Hill chronicles the lives of twin brothers raised on a rural British farm, their existence circumscribed by the boundaries of their home. Tending to the rugged land and sharing a bed, they remain untouched by the advances of the twentieth century.

The book was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize and later adapted into a film by Andrew Grieve.

Octavo, pp. 249; very good in the original red wrappers, printed in black to covers and spine (spine slightly worn and sunned, joints splitting at foot but sound).
