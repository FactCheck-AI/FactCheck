More than half the dancers in the 2014 USA International Ballet Competition advanced to the Round II semi-finals in Jackson, in what ballet circles generally agree is the world's top competition.

From the field of 91 competitors, 54 are moving on to the Round II's contemporary ballet, Friday through Sunday at Thalia Mara Hall.

Dancers are divided into junior (ages 15-18) and senior (ages 19-26) divisions. The breakdown of semi-finalists: 14 senior females; 18 senior males; 14 junior females; 7 junior males.

Japan has the highest number of dancers moving forward, with 11; USA's 10 and the Republic of Korea's nine are close behind. Brazil is next in line with seven, and China has four. Dancers representing Australia, Mongolia, Russia, Cuba, Chile, Portugal, Mexico and South Africa are also advancing in "what has truly been an international competition," IBC jury co-chair John Meehan of Australia said.

Among the semi-finalists are such crowd favorites as: seniors Kaori Fukui and Jun Tanabe of Japan, whose "Don Quixote" wrapped up Tuesday night with a bow; junior Brazilian charmers Yasmin Lomondo and Gustavo Carvalho; Russian senior Irina Sapozhnikova, who fanned sparks with noncompeting (and highly gold medaled, including here) partner Joseph Phillips; and seniors Sirui Liu (China) and Rodrigo Almares (Cuba), whose precision and playful interaction won the crowd.

A restructured Round II this year requires competitors to choose one solo or pas de deux from a contemporary repertoire. Top-notch choreographers Trey McIntyre and Matthew Neenan contributed several works to the 2014 competition. Dancers learned their choice before arrival. Neenan and a member of the Trey McIntyre Project is on hand to work with dancers.

A few longtime IBC watchers fear they'll miss the wild-card thrill of previous Round IIs, and are apprehensive about repetition of works, albeit by different dancers, they'll see in the semi-finals.

IBC jurors are positive about the change. Contemporary ballet in competition can be tricky from both judging and competitor selection perspectives, Meehan said. "Occasionally, the dancer will choose repertoire that is impossible to judge, or very difficult to judge.

"I think this is going to be better for both the competitors — they're going to be less at sea, finding their choice — and for us, too, because it levels the playing field a little."

Canadian judge Andre Lewis said, "You're comparing apples to apples."

Former IBC medalists Brooklyn Mack and Jeffrey Cirio also endorsed the move. Judges will know how the piece should be danced, Cirio said. Mack said it also helps bridge gaps between the varying resources and economic backgrounds of the dancers.

Eliminated dancers have another chance to be seen in performance, in Sunday's Edward Stierle Contemporary Showcase.
