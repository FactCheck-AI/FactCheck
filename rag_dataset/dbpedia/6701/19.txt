The Israeli parliament has elected veteran Likud lawmaker Reuven Rivlin as the country's next president.

Mr Rivlin, a former parliamentary speaker and Cabinet minister, defeated long-time MP Meir Sheetrit, by 63 to 53 in a secret run-off ballot.

He will succeed Shimon Peres, 90, who ends his seven-year term in July.

Mr Rivlin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, will become Israel's 10th president.

"From this moment, I do not belong to any party; rather, I belong to everyone, a man of the nation," he told Knesset members , externalafter the poll.

"I stand here before you with a great mission. Long live the Israeli democracy! Long live Israel!"

The 74-year-old opposes the creation of a Palestinian state, putting him at odds with the platform adopted by Mr Netanyahu.

He is also a supporter of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, another central issue in the dispute between Israel and the Palestinians.
