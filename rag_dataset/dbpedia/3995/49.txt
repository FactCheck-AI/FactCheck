Lucian Michael Freud

Lucian Freud, grandson of psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, was one of the foremost British portraitists of the 20th century. His thickly impastoed paintings are known for their psychological penetration and often unflinching examination of the relationship between artist and model. Freud's subjects, often portrayed in stark, revealing detail, range from friends and family to royalty and the underworld, showcasing the breadth of human experience. His dedication to the art of painting and portraiture remained unwavering throughout his life.
