Labels #1 [L1]: Black Columbia labels with silver text, and a blue "Columbia Records Magic Notes Trademark" at the top, and a blue "Columbia" in the center. Underneath the blue "Columbia" it says "Sold in U.K. subject to resale price conditions. See price lists." On most copies, the letters "K" and "T" are stamped on one of the labels (on either on side 1 or 2) on each side of the spindle hole. These are the U.K. tax stamps and indicate that the tax was paid for this album. At the bottom of the label, it says "Made in Gt. Britain."

Text around the bottom edge of the label starts at 10 o'clock and says:

The Gramophone Co., Ltd. All rights of the manufacturer and of the owner of the recorded work reserved. Unauthorised public performance, broadcasting, and copying of this record prohibited.

Labels #2 [L2]: Some copies of this issue have been found with a slightly different font on the labels, and with the layout of the song titles and credits altered. For example, the songwriting credits for Interstellar Overdrive on side 2 have been moved to under the song title as opposed to being next to the song title as they are found on earlier issues. These labels appear to have been put on later pressings, but may have occurred silmultaneously with the other version of the label, perhaps just a label printing variation from a different printing plant.

Please see below above data from the Pink Floyd archives and this early pressed copy indicated in Bold

The Record itself is VISUALLY graded as VERY GOOD (+) I can see some hazy scratches and more on SIDE 1 that would/could affect playback. Side 1 seems to have a deposit on it which may benefit from a very good clean. (Something of which I don't do as I don't have the correct equipment).

The labels show some indication of use.

The inner is in Excellent Condition.

The Spine is in Excellent condition with storage bumps corners. The sleeve is in Very Good Condition no tears or rips or sellotape used for repairs .The cover has a nice sheen, with no writing on it.

Cheapest on Ebay by far for this conservatively graded LP.

Please note I am no Vinyl expert but I am starting to fall for the lure of Vinyl, I am currently saving for my first player and therefore all grading is done under strong light only.The records themselves are inherited through various family members who no longer deem it a format of choice.

I will try to answer any questions posed, to the best of my ability.

Please note that all items will be carefully packaged and only sent using recorded delivery.

Also please note that the condition of this and any other Vinyl I will list will not all of a sudden turn into a superior than stated copy in the post.

I do only rarely grade using mint.Cheapest by far on EBAY in this condition!!
