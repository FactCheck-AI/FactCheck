Autopkg tests can be written for any ubuntu package. The tests follow the DEP 8 specification for including tests as part of a deb package.

Writing a test

A test can be written in a myriad of languages. Common examples are C, bash, python and perl. To write a test:

Branch the package bzr branch ubuntu:

Add a source section in debian/control called XS-Testsuite: autopkgtest

Add the tests to debian/tests/ folder

Add a debian/tests/control which specifies the requirements for the testbed. For example:

Tests: build Depends: build-essential

Contributing tests

Getting the test into ubuntu follows the normal ubuntu developer process. In short, you

Branch the source of the package you wish to add a test

Edit the debian/control and debian/tests/control file to enable the tests

Add the test(s) to debian/tests folder

Commit your changes and propose a merge
