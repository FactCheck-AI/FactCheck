King Ludwig I orders the transfer of the university, later named after Duke Ludwig der Reiche and King Maximilian I, from Landshut to Munich.

1826

Johann Andreas Buchner is transferred from Landshut to Munich. From 1830, he teaches pharmaceutical chemistry in a privately financed institute and in 1840 moves into an institute with a laboratory and lecture hall in the main university building on Ludwigstrasse. In 1842, he is elected rector of Ludwig Maximilian University.

1852

Justus von Liebig, then Germany's best-known chemist, was appointed from Giessen to the chair of chemistry in Munich and was given a new institute building at Sophienstrasse and Arcisstrasse.

Among Liebig's doctoral students were:

Friedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz,

August Wilhelm von Hofmann,

Emil Erlenmeyer and

Adolph Strecker.

1870

The chemical laboratory under the direction of Adolf von Baeyer.

1875

Two years after Liebig's death, Adolf von Baeyer is appointed full professor of chemistry. The institute, which now also has an inorganic department in addition to the organic department, develops into Germany's best-known chemistry school after being expanded under Baeyer's leadership. Baeyer was ennobled in 1885 and received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905 for work on organic dyes.

1877

Baeyer's large working group includes many students who are later honored as outstanding scientists, e.g.

Emil Fischer (Nobel price for chemistry 1902),

Eduard Buchner (Nobel price for chemistry1907),

Richard WillstÃ¤tter (Nobel price for chemistry 1915) and

Heinrich Wieland (Nobel price for chemistry 1927).

1892

Chemistry and pharmacy move from the medical to the philosophical faculty.

1892

Albert Hilger is appointed to the chair of pharmaceutical chemistry by Erlangen and receives a new institute building in KarlstraÃe. In 1894, an "Anstalt fÃ¼r Nahrungs- und Genussmittel" (institute for food and beverages) is added.

1893

Group picture of the members of the Chemical Institute. In addition to the two Nobel Prize winners Baeyer and WillstÃ¤tter, you can see, among others:

Walter Dieckmann ("Dieckmann condensation"),

Johannes Thiele ("Thiele hypothesis of Partial valences") and

Victor Villiger ("Baeyer-Villiger oxidation").

1897

Following Baeyer's proposals, the "Verbandsexamen" (association examination) is introduced for all chemistry students in the German Reich.

1905

Adolf von Baeyer receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

1915

A. v. Baeyer resigns and Richard WillstÃ¤tter, Baeyer's student and director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, is appointed full professor of chemistry and director of the "chemical laboratory of the state. WillstÃ¤tter receives the 1915 Nobel Prize for Chemistry in the same year for research on plant dyes. The chemical institute is enlarged and modernized.

1916

a "Gerichtlich-Chemische Untersuchungsstelle" (forensic chemical testing laboratory) and a "Forschungsanstalt fÃ¼r Lebensmittelchemie" (research institute for food chemistry) are established.

1924

WillstÃ¤tter resigns as director of the institute because of anti-Semitic tendencies in the university and emigrates to Switzerland in 1939.

1926

WillstÃ¤tter was succeeded by Heinrich Wieland, a Baeyer student and director of the Chemical Institute in Freiburg. Wieland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1927 (for work on bile acids).

1932

Warsaw-born Kasimir Fajansbecomes head of the Institute for Physical Chemistry on Sophienstrasse, built with the help of the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935 he is dismissed because he is Jewish, and in 1936 he is expatriated.

1935

A pharmacognostic institute ("Institut fÃ¼r Pharmazeutische Arzneimittellehre") is established in KarlstraÃe.

1937

Chemistry and pharmacy move from the Faculty of Philosophy to the Faculty of Science.

1938

the administration of the "Chemical Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences" is taken over by the University.

1939

Establishment of a diploma program chemistry.

1944

The chemical and pharmaceutical institutes are destroyed by bombs.

1946

Teaching and research are taken up on a makeshift basis.

1948

Eugen Bamann, WillstÃ¤tter's student, is appointed head of the Institute of Pharmacy and Food Chemistry in Munich. Research and teaching are housed in makeshift quarters in various parts of the city.

1950

Heinrich Wieland becomes professor emeritus. By 1953, four chairs are established and filled:

Georg-Maria Schwab (Physical Chemistry),

Egon Wiberg (Anorganic Chemistry),

Rolf Huisgen (Organic Chemistry, Wieland student, later most cited German chemist) and

Feodor Lynen (Biochemistry, Nobel Prize 1964), who became director of the Max Planck Institute for Cell Chemistry in 1954.

1954 - 1958

four new institutes (organic, inorganic, physical chemistry and biochemistry) are built between KarlstraÃe and SophienstraÃe.

1957 - 1959

New buildings for the "Institute of Pharmacy and Food Chemistry" and the "Institute of Pharmaceutical Pharmacy" are erected between Sophienstrasse and Karlstrasse.

1999 - 2004

Relocation of the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy to the "Campus GroÃhadern/Martinsried" on the western edge of Munich.
