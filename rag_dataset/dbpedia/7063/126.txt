From BLACK SWAMP PLAYERS

The Black Swamp Players will open its 53rd season with the heartwarming comedy “I Ought To Be in Pictures.”

Written by Neil Simon, “I Ought To Be In Pictures” focuses on Herb (Heath A. Diehl), a Hollywood scriptwriter currently “at liberty,” who is surprised when his forgotten past reappears in the form of Libby (Katya Dachik), a teenage daughter who has trekked from Brooklyn with dreams of movie stardom. With Steffy (Tiffany Scarola), his sometime paramour, at his side, Herb decides to take another stab at fatherhood and hopefully this time, get it right. The play opened on Broadway in April 1980 under the direction of Herbert Ross. In 1982, Simon’s comedy was adapted to film and starred Walter Matthau, Ann-Margaret, and Dinah Manoff.

“I Ought To Be in Pictures” will be performed Sept. 17, 18, 24, and 25 at 8 p.m. and Sept. 19 and 26 at 2 p.m.. Doors open 30 minutes prior to curtain time.

The production is being directed by Wayne G. Weber.

All patrons will be asked to wear a mask for the duration of the performance.
