Last night (18 June 2024) an extraordinary meeting of Council took place, to debate a vote of no confidence motion in the Leader of the Council, Councillor Baggy Shanker.

Following a recorded vote, the motion was tied. As permitted by the Councilâ€™s Constitution, the Mayor then exercised his casting vote in favour of the motion, meaning the vote of no confidence was carried, and Councillor Shanker was removed as the Leader of the Council.

Later in the meeting, nominations were taken to appoint the new Leader of the Council.

Councillor Peatfield was appointed unopposed as the new Leader of Derby City Council, having previously served as the Deputy Leader since May 2023.

In the interest of stability for the city and the council, all cabinet roles will remain unchanged at present, except that Councillor Peatfield will take on Strategy and Policy. Councillor Shanker will serve as Deputy Leader of the Council and continue as Cabinet Member for Governance and Finance.

The Leader of the Council will confirm any changes to her cabinet at the next meeting of the Council, which is scheduled for 17 July.
