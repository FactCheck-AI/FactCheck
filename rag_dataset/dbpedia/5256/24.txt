Randy and the Mob is a well crafted, well acted, feel good film which suffers a little from pacing and plotting.

The acting is excellent, and the portrayal of small town life (where everyone knows everything you've ever done) is dead on.

Ray McKinnon's performance as Randy is great, he's a guy who wants to be a big time business man but doesn't have the business or people skills to pull it off. McKinnon also plays Randy's twin brother, Cecil, the openly gay owner of an antiques store. McKinnon's performance as Cecil is subtle and realistic yet so completely different from Randy that at first I wasn't entirely sure he was the same actor.

The initial setup of the story is slow and feels a bit forced. It's essentially there to introduce the character of Tino, a mob affiliate who is so other worldly it seems he might at any moment reveal himself to be a space alien.

At this point Randy and the Mob becomes a mysterious stranger sort of film where some outsider drops in and helps everyone discover themselves. But it does it well and with humor and with genuine heart even if some of the plot feels sort of forced together at points.

Randy and the Mob is a good choice if you're looking for something that's amusing and light hearted. Though it seems that with a little tweaking the film could have been much better it's definitely a good example of what the quirky-small-town-life type film should be like.
