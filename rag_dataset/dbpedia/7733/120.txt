Education was a top priority for Annan. He attended several universities, all over the world and earning a different degree at each institution. Most notable, Annan attended Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland, and the MIT Sloan School of Management in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

As UN secretary-general, Annan facilitated a peaceful resolution to a conflict involving Iraq that had reached an impasse because of Iraq's initial refusal to comply with weapons inspections.
