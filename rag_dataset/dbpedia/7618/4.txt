The Orchard broadens its catalog with the acquisition of blues and roots label Blind Pig Records, and will continue to release new product on the imprint.

Indie distributor The Orchard has acquired the extensive catalog of blues and roots label Blind Pig Records. The deal includes working with Blind Pig's founders and staff to release five new albums in 2015 from Albert Cummings, Victor Wainwright, Cash Box Kings, Zac Harmon and Andy T & Nick Nixon.

Through the deal, the Blind Pig catalog – previously distributed through eOne distribution – is now owned and will be distributed digitally and physically worldwide by The Orchard. This latest label addition is part of The Orchard’s growing focus on catalog acquisitions. Over the years, the company has brought a number of independent labels including TVT Records, Frenchkiss Records, Discos Joey, JDub, Xanadu and Membran,

Blind Pig launched in 1977 in the basement of the Ann Arbor blues club by the same name and quickly became recognized as one of the world’s premier American Blues and Roots labels. Now based in Chicago and San Francisco, Blind Pig’s repertoire includes Muddy Waters, Magic Slim, Poppa Chubby, Charlie Musselwhite, James Cotton, The Cash Box Kings and Otis Clay.
