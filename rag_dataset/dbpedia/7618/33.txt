Music and movie distributor The Orchard has acquired the catalogue of blues and roots label Blind Pig Records.

The Orchard team will work with the Blind Pig founders and staff to release five albums in 2015 from Albert Cummings, Victor Wainwright, Cash Box Kings, Zac Harmon and Andy T & Nick Nixon.

Blind PigÂ began in 1977 in the basement of the Ann Arbor blues club by the same name. Now based in Chicago and San Francisco, Blind Pigâs repertoire includes Muddy Waters, Magic Slim, Poppa Chubby, Charlie Musselwhite, James Cotton, The Cash Box Kings and Otis Clay.

âJerry and I are extremely proud of the incredible music Blind Pig Records and our artists have produced over the last 38 years,â says Blind Pig Co-Founder and President, Edward Chmelewski.

âWe look forward to working with The Orchard to carry on our rich legacy of uniquely American and timeless music.â

âThis dynamic company continues to develop successful business models for digital distribution that will give our artists the exposure they need in this new music market,â adds Co-Founder Jerry Del Giudice.

âThe worldwide reach that The Orchard has achieved will benefit our artists and their music immensely, both today and in the years to come.â

The Blind Pig catalogue — previously distributed through eOne distribution — is now owned and will be distributed digitally and physically worldwide by The Orchard.

This latest label addition is part of The Orchardâs growing focus on catalogue acquisitions. Over the years, the company has brought a number of independent labels under its roof including TVT Records, Frenchkiss Records, Discos Joey, JDub, Xanadu and Membran, among others.

âBringing genre-leading catalogues like Blind Pig to The Orchard helps us unlock strategic and financial growth opportunities for the company and our clients,â says Colleen Theis, COO of The Orchard.

âWhile our primary focus remains distribution, sales, marketing and business services to third party clients, we are proud to assume the responsibility of stewardship for important catalogs of music and to continue to develop their individual brands.â

With this increased focus on label acquisitions, The Orchard has launched a new division of catalogue specialists working specifically to acquire, rejuvenate, repackage and market owned content and brands. The Orchard has hired industry veteran Scott Ambrose Reilly (Amazon, X5 Music, eMusic, Bullethead Management) to run the new division.

âI am proud to be part of this deal with Blind Pig Recordsâ says Reilly. âHaving access to this historic Blues catalog and being able to continue to work with and learn from veterans such as Jerry and Edward is a win/win for everyone. This model of buying catalogs with continued involvement from label founders will be a bright spot in our business over the next several yearsâ.Music Business Worldwide
