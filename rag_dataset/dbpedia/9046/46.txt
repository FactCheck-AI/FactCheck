I started Magic Bullet Fund in 2004. Bullet was still with me… it’s hard to believe he has been gone for 20 years. The fund has been helping dogs and cats in the U.S. get cancer treatments for 20 years. All told, we have helped 918 pets, and their families…

With help from generous people like you!

Your generosity has allowed so many families keep their pets with them a little longer… in some cases, a lot longer.

Since you are one of the very special people who donated to help, you must know that any extra time with a beloved pet is very precious.

I wish I could have kept the fund running forever! I am so sad to see it end. But it is time for me to retire now.

Thank you so much for being part of the Magic Bullet Fund’s mission!
