"Now you notice we are beginning to use social security numbers and all new students next year will

not have an ID, but will have social security. Within a year or two there'll be a law that every baby when

born will have to have his social security number tatooed on his right buttocks and that man's social

security will also have to be put on his tombstone."

Dean William Tate

March 22,1971

17

During this Spring quarter of 1971, when we all are celebrating my retirement after fifty-one years in and around the

Athens campus, my academic biography has been fully presented.

First, my campus career was written for the Alumni Record by Dr. John Stegeman, son of my track coach. His father

was also dean of men, and I first worked under him as dean of freshmen. Second, for the University Self-study, I did a

long and involved comparison of undergraduate life then (1920-1924) and now (1966-1970). Third, the Alumni Society

at its May meeting presented "The Ballad of Wild Bill", with music and words and sound effects, a masterful skit that

rocked our sides.

However, none of these more than touch the legendary but powerful figure of Chancellor David C. Barrow ("Uncle

Dave" as we called him) who dominated in his quiet way the campus when I was an undergraduate in the early 1920's.

Heeding my mother's admonition, that I go to church and Sunday School regularly, 1 was in the Freshman Bible Class

at the First Methodist Church (then called "The Methodist Episcopal Church, South"), and "Uncle Dave" was my

teacher about 25 of us freshmen in the upper balcony of the sanctuary, with me as secretary-treasurer. Our heads all

glistened, for the sophomores had "cut our hair", but "Uncle Dave" was bald-headed, too, despite a flowing beard

like Santa Claus.

About a month later, say October 1920, I got a note, written I think in his own longhand, to see him in his office,

which was on the first floor of the Academic Building near the Arch. As a freshman, I was scared stiff, began to wonder

what sins had caught up with me, imagined myself "sent home" to Fairmount and the Salacoa Valley.

As summoned, I appeared, to find "Uncle Dave" sitting at his desk. He gestured me to a nearby chair, smiled in his

matchless way, a beautiful smile under twinkling eyes. He was not a big man, just average in height but sturdily built;

but his distinctive white beard, his kindly smile, his twinkling eyes, his easy, leisurely ways all students and all faculty

respected, even revered him.

I sat down, scared of course, and he began to doodle, as often he did, sketching a geometric pattern on a pad on his

desk.

"Where are you from, Mr. Tate? Are you from Tate?"

"No, I'm from Fairmount. My father's family established Tate, and Father was born there. They're all my folks, but I

live sixteen miles away at Fairmount, where my grandmother, Mary Byrd Tate, was born."

"What kin are you to Sam Tate?"

"He's my father's first cousin, sorter head of the family". And he doodled some more, filling out a figure, shading

it in.

"He's helped the University. He raised some money for an institute here, to study Georgia economics. And is Sam

Sibley kin to you?"

"Not exactly, but I claim it. He and my uncle married sisters, the Hart twins from Union Point. He's a federal judge,

and we all look up to him. But we call him Uncle Hale, not Sam."

"Maybe he has the best legal mind ever developed in Georgia he and Logan Bleckley."

18

And "Uncle Dave" smiled, doodled on, and I excused myself, he nodded, and I quietly slipped out not suspended!

Scion of a prominent Georgia family, which was honored in 1970 as the University family of the year, David Crenshaw

Barrow had graduated from the University in civil engineering and law, had returned to his alma mater to teach math,

later to be dean of the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, had become president when Mr. Hill died in 1908, was the

symbolic figure of the University until his retirement in 1925, to be followed by Charles Mercer Snelling, who had been

my academic and administrative dean. When elected president (our president in Athens had the title of "Chancellor"

and signed the diplomas of all the four-year state schools), "Uncle Dave" had fewer than four hundred students; and

he handled loans, scholarships, excuses for absences, and all disciplinary cases, as shown by his papers filed in the Li-

brary.

Around him centers my best story of college life, a colorful proverbial expression that seems to me a perfect gem of

campus lore. It is especially useful to me when I've had one of those disorganized, hectic, nagging days when I've got-

ten up on the wrong side of the bed, when everything goes wrong, when it seems that the Deity created the entire Uni-

verse for my inconvenience.

In college Dave Barrow had had a fight with one of the Hurts from Atlanta, who became a firm friend and admirer of

Mr. Barrow and sent his son here. That Hurt family built the first skyscraper in Atlanta, and they have sent many of their

children here, some under my deanship.

But this boy was cutting classes after an earlier conference with his father and Mr. Barrow, and "Uncle Dave" was

standing in the hall talking to "Uncle Tom" Reed, our registrar, himself famous for his ability to remember names. To

Uncle Tom's remarks that often trying to get a boy to study was like beating one's head on a rock wall, Mr. Barrow an-

swered with a perfect description of a lazy boy, "Yes, working with a sorry boy who won't try is just like going bird-

hunting and having to tote the dogs". It's a perfect comment, a gem of an expression, often a consolation to me, for

despite my optimism about students, I know some are lazy and won't do their best. And again I say it is a perfect phrase

^Working with a sorry boy who won't try is just like going bird-hunting and having to tote the dogs". Note that his

Georgia background made "Uncle Dave" use two natural expressions for this state and this people "a sorry boy"

and "tote".

Over the years I have spoken hard and harsh to lazy students. One boy with a pleasing personality, a good mind, in

college by the scarifices of his widowed mother, was doing "C" work when he had an "A" brain; and in my discussion

with him he slyly implied that I was accusing him of laziness. "Yes, you're lazy, deep-dyed lazy. If you ever marry and

your wife has a child, it will be prima facie evidence of adultery."

When the Barrow family was honored a year ago on "G" Day, much stress was laid on the number of that family who

had attended the University, originally from Oglethorpe County, with branches both in Athens and Savannah, well

over a hundred.

However, I think the strongest, the unique feature is the chain of five generations, father to son, who have been con-

nected to the University all named David. The first David attended Philip Exeter and Harvard, and he was a trustee.

His oldest son resigned from West Point, entered the Confederate Army, died in the battle of Big Pond or Olustee in

Florida; and another son was a United States Senator. The youngest son, who was named David, became Chancellor of

the University; and his son David was Regents' Distinguished Professor of Mathematics; and his son David retired as a

colonel and teaches geography at the University; and his son David has graduated and works in the Computer Center.

Five generations of "David to David" to be connected with the University trustee, president, distinguished profes-

sor, teacher, technician. It's like the begets in the Bible!

And Barrow County, which isn't his home, was named for him and his brother Pope, and also Barrow Hall in the Ag

engineering group; and some alumni raised a large gift to establish the David Crenshaw Barrow Chair of Mathematics.

And five of his grandchildren made Phi Beta Kappa! I married one of them.

"Uncle Dave" was a little boy when news reached Athens that his brother Jim had died in battle; but plans to bury

him at the Old Home Place in Oglethorpe County were changed to put him in Oconee Hills, where the two brothers

lie side by side. One was written up by Dr. E. Merton Coulter in "James Barrow the Last Generation", a book dis-

cussing the generation of the South's best who died in the Last Cause. Uncle Tom Reed wrote a biography of "Uncle

Dave", and his writings have been collected in a memorial volume by his widow.

Once an alumnus, a good person and a gentleman who had been successful in a modest way but who had gradu-

ated from Georgia by the hardest way financially, with a loan directly from Chancellor Barrow, came to my office and

asked if I knew where "Uncle Dave" was buried. We went down to the Barrow lot in Oconee Hills, and we looked at

three graves there James Barrow, Colonel of Confederate Infantry when not thirty; Jewett Williams, Rhodes Scholar

and Professor of New Testament Greek at Swanee, dying as an infantry captain in World War I; and Chancellor Barrow's

grave. The alumnus looked at "Uncle Dave's" grave, started crying, then finally said,

"I never would have made it in college except for him. If I have ever known a great man, it's him, right there."

As a freshman and a sophomore I attended Chapel twice a week, as a junior and a senior once a week. And "Uncle

Dave" had charge, and we had a song, a prayer, a scripture reading with comments, and announcements. I didn't have

a high regard for this chore then, not considering it relevant I guess in the terminology of this generation; but looking

back over the years, it meant more than I realized. And at every Chapel I carefully looked around each time to see if

I knew every classmate!

Once "Uncle Dave" read from a psalm about good husbandry, saving your resources. Then looking over the tops of

his glasses, as he regularly did since he didn't wear bifocals, he gave us three rules for endorsing a note for a friend.

He enumerated them by holding up three fingers as he talked in his simple, lucid style with pauses for emphasis.

"First, your friend's credit isn't good, and he must use yours. And sometimes you must help a friend or a kinsman.

Second, don't endorse for a friend more than you can pay, don't ruin yourself and your family this way. Third, when

you endorse, begin to think about planning to pay."

19

Then he carefully repeated these simple rules. Next he looked carefully and thoughtfully over his glasses at us quiet

students, smiled and chuckled, and said,

"I paid one about an hour ago."

The year before, with a Freshman cap on, he had rung the Chapel bell because "a thousand students had registered";

but only my year, September 1920, did we have a thousand regular students. He told us in Chapel that the Class of 1924

was starting when the University had 1024 regular students, stressing in his mathematic approach the number 24 the

designation of our class and also the excess over a thousand 24! There were also 138 rehabs, fewer than the year

before; but he counted them as students both times for the final figure, for they were.

Cotton was king then, our major money crop, and Athens was the largest inland market in Georgia, maybe in the

South. And in Chapel "Uncle Dave" asked us not to smoke on the street. The warehouses were filled and overflowing,

and cotton was piled on the streets. One bale was placed next to the curb on the street, another on the curb toward

' the sidewalk, and a third on top of these. Although only one side of the street was used (Lumpkin, Broad, Oconee,

Clayton, Washington, Pulaski) still the streets were narrowed by the bales, and cotton seemed to be everywhere.

After his retirement "Uncle Dave" moved from the Chancellor's House on the Campus back to the family house at

436 Dearing Street, where I appeared regularly to court his granddaughter. Like every youngster in his twenties, I

thought of "Uncle Dave" as old, ancient in his sixties but he was about my own age now. He always came by about

9:00 to speak to me and to wish me and Sue Fan "good night," for he retired early.

"Uncle Dave" loved this state, this school, and this campus, and he loved people, just as I do. Like me, he was pro-

vincial, and he ran the University on shoe-string finances because the State of Georgia was poor. He had been a boy

during Reconstruction, as shown in his own writings for instance, his often published paper on Sill's Fork Plantation

before and after the War. And yet in his human depth and sincerity and judgment he would have adjusted to

i "Changes" just as others have done.

"Uncle Dave" was a farmer, managing with his friends Dave and Pope Spratlin (both named for Barrows) two large

plantations, a story which I won't tell here, except to say "the boll weevil" wiped them out.

As I grow older, I remember what he said about his home-place on the plantation, near the family graveyard, "To

us Barrows there is nothing prettier than the sunrise across the valley at the Flome Place, and to me as I grow older they

become more beautiful than ever, even though I know I shall see fewer of them."

Your Instructor

for this course will be

WILLIAM TATE

Associate Professor of English

and

Dean of Men

Dean Tate is one of the Universitys ablest and most popular staff members. He is

firmly convinced that there is nothing quite so fine as a Georgia boy with a Geor-

gia education. He came to the University from Fairmount, Georgia, received both

his A.B. and M.A. degrees here. He has done some work at the University of Chicago

and at Harvard toward a doctorate. As an undergraduate he was a member of the

cross country team, Y.M.C.A., Sphinx, Gridiron, Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa.

Dean Tate devotes most of his waking hours to personal conferences with students,

individually and in groups. He has made personal tours over the state from time to

time in behalf of educational privileges for Georgia boys and girls. In residence Dean

Tate teaches courses in literature and history.

Mrs. Tate is a grandaughter of Chancellor David Barrow. There are two Tate boys.

RARE WISDOM AND RED GRAVY

Dean William Tate:

On attitudes of youth in a supermarket age:

"Bread to them means something their mother buys every

Saturday, wrapped in cellophane, that despisable Yankee con-

traption designed to keep Southerners from their food."

On accepting current information as if it will hold true in the

future:

"When I look at the students on our Georgia campus, I do

not wonder whether this boy or that might be president of the

United States, I wonder whether we are teaching them any-

thing as foolish as I was taught about population and people

just 30 years ago in a formal treatise on economics."

(As a student, Dean Tate says, he had learned in a course

that population of Western nations would decline in 1950 and

become stationary. Instead it has boomed more than three-

fold.)

On changing positions:

"I'd rather be dean of men at Georgia than president of

Harvard."

On eating:

"Only an expert knows about ham gravy. It's how you dip

the spoon into it."

On Sherman's March to the Sea:

"Even today when I see a Yankee light a match, I flinch."

The Atlanta Journal, Jan. 31,1962.

DEAN WILLIAM TATE

To Dean William Tate (always called Bill by his close friends and associates) there goes up on his retirement a uni-

versal acclaim that is well deserved. He is unique in many respects, and as a whole it may well be said that there is and

has been none other like him in the annals of the University. He is even tempered, always the same, never frustrated,

never excited, always sociable. And always talkative, and generally with something to say well worth listening to.

He was an excellent student in the University. In a class in Georgia History taught by this writer, Bill made the highest

mark ever given in that class. He absorbed like a sponge Georgia history, and especially the history of the University.

But Bill was not a grind or bookworm. History came easy to him as indeed did whatever the other courses had to offer.

Thus, he had time to enter athletic activities and become a hard-to-beat cross-country runner. But in addition to being

a staid historian, Bill is a folklorist of sorts. He knows many good stories, all respectable, and most of them were taken

from factual backgrounds. He always liked his native haunts of Fairmount, in the northern part of the state, and on the

slightest provocation he will talk for hours on what happened there, including a great deal about his Mama, who was a

banker as well as a leader in other activities.

Apart from Bill's love and affection for his family, the students of the University come first. His time is always at their

disposal, in fair weather and foul. When any of them are in trouble, sick or in need of hospital care or in jail, Bill is at

their side. At any time of the day or night, whether 9 p.m. or 3 a.m. he is as much to them as any father could be. And

all of this is simply a part of the even tenor of his way. And in time past Bill's services have not stopped with his family

or the University students. If the History or the English Department found itself overwhelmed with students and no-

body to teach a class or two and no money to hire someone, Bill would volunteer his services "free, gratis for nothing."

It is understood that Bill, until his retirement, is still a member of the English Department, and was formerly an active

teacher until he became Dean of Students.

Being a fluent speaker and never hesitating for a word, Bill has made hundreds of speeches over the state and na-

tion, and still has found time to administer to the students of the University and win their loyalty and respect as no

other University official has ever done. And so probably no one will dispute the fact that Dean William Tate has made

for himself a niche in the history of the University that none other has or will ever reach.

There is the University of Georgia, and there is the community of Athens, Georgia.

Once the two met only for Administrative necessities. But some University students

could not ignore the pressing needs of the underprivileged sector of the Athens

community. Those were students who were not content simply to attend classes en-

veloped within an ordered, prosperous academic world. These students sought in-

volvement with the problems of the less advantaged community surrounding the

University. Thus...

"Yes. I've found within myself real peace. Only when

Jesus came into my dissatisfied heart did I find peace

not within myself by anything I did, but in Himself

and what He did. He paid the penalty of my sin and

made me right with God. He removed all guilt and

more than that, He made fellowship with God pos-

sible. That fellowship with my risen Savior, Jesus,

has produced an inexplicable peace and joy that

can only be known through personal faith in Jesus."

Hello, my name's Judy Friar. Mind if I talk with you?'bout what? Jesus Christ. Oh. Did you know that Cod has a wonder-

ful plan for your life? So does Unde Sam! Does Cod give out numbers too? No, see . . . that's the first of four laws that

govern the spiritual universe. You can find them all in the Bible. Well, I don't read a lot. I do have my Bible here. Keep

my contacts in it. It's the only thing on my side of the room that my roommate won't touch. Well, to continue ... why

do you think most people aren't experiencing the abundant life? The potato famine? Is this conversation upsetting

you? No, I apologize. Go ahead. It's because man is sinful, heh-heh. I know. And man is separated. From what? Christ.

Oh yeah, Christ. You see, Jesus Christ is man's redeemer of sins. Through him you can know and experience Cod's love

and plan for your life. Is that law number two? No, this is number three. Law number two was that man is sinful. Hey,

you've got those down pretty good. Hit me with the next one. Number four tells us we have to receive Jesus as Savior.

Then we can experience Cod's plan for our life. Look, what is this plan? I'll get to it. Let me finish this law, will you?

Oh ... Excuse me. We must receive Christ by personal invitation. See this diagram? You mean the circle full of dots

with the 'E' and the cross? No, the other one with Christ on the throne. Is that what this is? Yes, here Christ is in con-

trol. Who's on the throne in your life? I guess I am. Isn't your life full of discord and frustration like the circle with

the ego in the center and the uneven dots? I never thought about it like that. Listen, do you know something I don't?

I know that with Christ in control you can have an abundant life. Hey, do you have this abundant life? Since I found

Christ I have. You can find him too . . . through prayer. Do you pray? Sure, before every test and blind date. I've taken

Math 101 three times and the frat voted my last date the ugliest girl for this quarter. Here .. . read this prayer. Does it

express the desire of your heart? . . . well... If it does, pray it right now. Can I finish my chili dog first? / get the idea

you aren't being serious with me. Does witnessing bother you? Well it's kinda like selling religion the way my old

man sells insurance. But what we want to do is to bring Christ to you. To show you how easy it is to get with Cod. Why

don't you drop in on one of our meetings? They're really. . . Hey, there's Jeff. Hold it a minute. Jeff! Jeff, Jesus Christ,

it's good to see you!!

"One of the biggest problems is trying to stagger classes so either my husband or

I can be at home with our baby."

"There is an utmost need for a day-care center for our children if both parents are

attending the university. It would be very helpful if the university could provide a

list of qualified babysitters for day and night needs. Sometimes it is impossible to at-

tend school activities unless a responsible babysitter is available and especially made

known to the married student."

"If sufficient health services are available to family dependents, it should be made

known."

"We feel that the transportation offered to married students would be much more

efficient to meet the needs of married students if the married housing bus could

run on a ten minute basis instead of a twenty minute schedule."

Cive-A-Damn Survey

Cive-A-Damn Survey

We (i.e. married students) don't need any more poorly constructed, poorly planned,

uncomfortable, and expensive Bug-a-boos like our University Village Apartments!!!"

It's very hard to get into the University Village; and married couples have to have a place

to live when they decide to go to college, not a year or two years later, as the waiting list

calls for."

As for the residents of Athens, rather the store managers and sales clerks, I have not

found many of them friendly and willing to help the students married or not married.

Some are hesitant to take checks, and that is well understandable, but some give the im-

pression of 'you need us for your essentials but we don't need you, so therefore why

should we be nice and courteous.'"

People just don't realize that Va of this student body is married. One person out of every

four people you meet on the campus is married."

UNIVERSITY THEATRE

Since its founding in 1931, the University Theatre of the

Department of Drama and Theatre has staged over one hun-

dred and fifty-five major productions of pre-modern and con-

temporary classics. The University Theatre also invites a

Visiting Director to stage one major production: Erik Vos of

the National Theatre, Amsterdam, directed his own version of

Hamlet-A Collage in Spring, 1970, and Anne Gullestad of the

National Theatre, Bergen, Norway directed Ibsen's epic Peer

Gynt in Fall, 1970.

The University Theatre's full repertory of major productions

is supplemented by the Laboratory Theatre's annual season,

including student-directed scenes and plays, Reader's Theatre

presentations, and experimental workshops. The University

Theatre also sponsors Summer Repertory, an annual summer

season of plays for the campus and community, as well as the

Annual High School Drama Workshop.

University Theatre productions from January 1970, to Jan-

uary, 1971, includes: Friedrich Duerrenmatt's The Physicists;

William Shakespeare Erik Vos, Hamlet-A Collage; Camilla

Wolak's Wizard of Oz; Max Frisch's Biedermann and the Fire-

bugs; and Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt.

Summer Repertory '70 productions were: My Sweet Charlie

by David Westheimer; Scuba Duba by Bruce Jay Friedman;

and Your Own Thing by Hester and Apolinar.

The Fifth Annual High School Drama Workshop presenta-

tions included: The Rimers of Eldritch by Lanford Wilson;

Comings and Goings by Megan Terry; and The Stolen Prince

by Dan Totheroh.
