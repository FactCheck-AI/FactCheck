The order for the oil and gas production platform was confirmed Friday, guaranteeing work for hundreds for at least two years.

Apart from the main contractor Technip, subcontractors will also be looking to hire extra hands to ensure fulfillment of the order.

The platform order will not only mean full-time work for 800 workers at the shipyard, but will also enlist an additional workforce of about 1,200 persons each year.

“We will immediately begin recruiting more people into our workforce. This order also means a lot of work for subcontractors, as we can’t do this alone,” said Personnel and Communications Director Tapio Tolsa.

The project also provides Technip Offshore Finland with an opportunity to go back to its shipbuilding roots, and is the first order of its size to have come to the company in three years.

“We also hope that this will help revive the entire area,” Tolsa added.

The completed platform will be delivered to the Gulf of Mexico in 2014.
