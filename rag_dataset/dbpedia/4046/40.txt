Everything we do here is to enrich our community and to preserve our historic campus. Washington College is a designated Historic District and has several buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Time, vandalism and severe weather have taken their toll. It is only through your support that we are able to continue the legacy. Would you consider making a tax-deductible donation to our cause? You can designate what you would like your donation to be used for, and if you wish, we will keep you updated on the progress that your donation is helping to make. Please reach out with any questions. We are a registered 501 c-3 in the state of Tennessee.
