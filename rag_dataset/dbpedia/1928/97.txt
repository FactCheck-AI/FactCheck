The 18-year-old BK Hacken forward is understood to be training with the Hammers' Under-21 squad.

Lipovac's advisor Linus Jacobsson told Fotbolltransfers.com: "Yes, West Ham sent an official invitation to Hacken, who thought it was good timing and a good experience for Robert, so they released him for a week. He has just completed his second training session with West Ham U21 and stays until Sunday."
