Harpalyke is one of the 100 moons discovered orbiting the planet Jupiter. Harpalyke was discovered on 23 November 2000 by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Yanga R. Fernandez, and Eugene Magnier. Harpalyke is a member of the Ananke group of Jupiter moons.

Harpalyke's mass is estimated/calculated at 119,893,474,647,775 kg. Its density has been calculated at being 2.6 g/cm^3. Harpalyke volume is 45.00 (km^3). The albedo of the Harpalyke is 0.04. The albedo is the amount of radiation reflected into space Harpalyke. Harpalyke's equatorial radius is 2.00km. The Equatorial Radius is based on the assumption of the albedo value. The escape velocity of Harpalyke is 10 km/h. The escape velocity is the speed an object needs to be travelling in order to break free from the objects gravity. The larger an object is, the more velocity (speed) is needed to break free from the object.

The equatorial circumference of Harpalyke is 13.8 km. The surface area of Harpalyke is 60.82 Km^2. The surface gravity of the Harpalyke is 0.002 m/s². For comparison, the Earth's surface gravity is 9.807 m/s². The larger an object is, the stronger the surface gravity is.The Mean Orbit Velocity (M.O.V.) is the speed at which it orbits is 8749.50 km/h. The average distance of the object from its parent is 21104000.00km.

Orbital Details

Harpalyke orbital period, i.e. the period it takes to complete an orbit round Jupiter is 623.3 days. The figure is also known as the sidereel period. The figure comes from N.A.S.A.. The orbital inclination of Harpalyke, the angle at which Harpalyke orbits to the orbital plane, is 148.7 degrees. The orbital eccentricity is 0.2261 of Harpalyke, the degree at which Harpalyke orbits close to a circular (0) orbit as opposed to an elliptical (1). The semi-major axis of the orbit is 21110 10^3Km, which is the furthest point from the centre to the edge of an elliptical point.

Ananke Moon Group

Ananke group of Jovian moons are all believed to have the same source, probably the result of a asteroid collision. The remnants were caught by the immense gravitational pull of Jupiter and remain in orbit ever since. The name derives it name from the largest in the group. All the members of the group orbit in a retrograde orbit hence why they all finish with the letter 'e' in their name.
