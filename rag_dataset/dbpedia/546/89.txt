LONDON — Britain’s most senior policeman, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Stephenson, is the latest victim of the News of the World phone hacking and police corruption scandal.

He announced his resignation at a press conference on Sunday.

In recent days Stephenson has faced increasing criticism for hiring former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis as an advisor. Last week Wallis was arrested and questioned by police probing the hacking.

Stephenson said his link to the journalist could hamper investigations.

He added there were lessons to be learned from the affair, but claimed he was ankling with his integrity intact.

Stephenson said he had no knowledge of the extent of the phone hacking at the paper.

In a statement he said: “I have taken this decision as a consequence of the ongoing speculation and accusations relating to the Met’s links with News Intl. (News Corp.’s British subsiduary) at a senior level and in particular in relation to Mr. Neil Wallis.”
