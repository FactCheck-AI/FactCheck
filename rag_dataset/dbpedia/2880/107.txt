Play as Jade, a young investigative reporter, and expose a terrible government conspiracy. Wary of her government’s promises to repel the aliens for good, she sets out to capture the truth behind the prolonged war. Armed with a camera, a dai-jo staff, and fierce determination, it’s your job to save your planet and its inhabitants. Beyond Good & Evil HD will also be coming to the PlayStation Network later this year.
