Businesses using Google Apps should have an easier time managing complex tasks starting today with the launch of Kissflow from startup OrangeScape — it’s supposedly the first workflow-creator that’s “deeply integrated” with Apps.

OrangeScape is pitching this as an alternative to using email and spreadsheets to track approvals and other tasks, which can turn into a headache as the company grows and tasks get more complex. With Kissflow, businesses should be able to create workflows for things like expense reporting in five relatively easy steps: Naming the process, designing the form, defining the workflow, configure the permissions, then publish.

And of course, there’s integration with Google Apps. Kissflow customers can attach Docs directly to their workflows, and collaborate with anyone else in their Google Apps domain. The interface is meant to be reminiscent of Gmail. And for security and control, every business on Kissflow gets a separate database on Google Cloud SQL.

Kissflow will be available in the Google Apps Marketplace and will be free for up to 10 users, then cost $3 per user after that.

As for the company behind the product, OrangeScape was founded by CEO Suresh Sambandam and CTO Mani Doraisamy. It has raised a $1 million “bridge round” from angel investors (including Sharad Sharma, former CEO of YahooIndia; Venkat Raju; Pramod Bhasin, former chairman, Nasscom and CEO of Genpact; Raman Roy, CEO of Quattro; and Linda Bernardi, CEO StraTerra Partners) and plans to raise a larger $10 million round later this year.

Oh, and for those of you at Google I/O, OrangeScape will be demonstrating the product in Room 5 at 2:45pm.
