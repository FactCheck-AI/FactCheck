The 1992 European Cup Final was a football match held on 20 May 1992 at Wembley Stadium, London, between Barcelona of Spain and Sampdoria of Italy. Barcelona won the game 1–0 in extra time, thanks to a Ronald Koeman free-kick, to record their first triumph in the competition. It was the first to have a group stage involving the eight second-round winners split into two groups, and the winner of each one met in the final. In doing so, they became the first Catalan club to win the tournament, the second Spanish club and 19th overall.
