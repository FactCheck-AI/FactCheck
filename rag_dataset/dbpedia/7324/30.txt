Born on this day in 1946, the British-American musician, singer-songwriter, and record producer, Barry Gibbs, rose to worldwide fame as a co-founder of the group Bee Gees, one of the most commercially successful groups in the history of popular music.

Barry, alongside his brothers Andy, Maurice, and Robin, rolled through the decades with hit after hit. Fifteen of their tracks enjoyed the number one spot on the charts.

The brothers delivered classics that will never grow old. But, their success was cut short by the death of Barry's three brothers.

This left him having to stand on his own, proving that he is a legend in his own right.

Barry went on to perform to large crowds of audiences and embarked on solo tours from the year 2013.

He has been enjoying success as a solo artist, producing hits such as 'In The Now'.
