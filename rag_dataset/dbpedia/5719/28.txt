Last night on Instagram, The Marías singer María Zardoya accused The Neighbourhood drummer Brandon Fried of groping her under a table. She wrote, "It was one of the most uncomfortable things I’ve ever experienced. I felt an invasion of my space, privacy and body."

She called on The Neighbourhood to get a new drummer, and The Neighbourhood responded by revealing that Brandon Fried is no longer in the band. "We are grateful to Maria for coming forward," The Neighbourhood wrote. "We have zero tolerance for any kind of inappropriate behaviour towards women. As a result of Brandon’s actions, he will no longer be a member of The Neighbourhood."

Fried has since responded to Zadoya's post on his own Instagram, writing, "I am so terribly sorry to María. My actions were inexcusable and intolerable. They are not reflective of who I am as a person, but clearly a reflection of who I become while under the influence."

"It is evident that I must address my problems with alcohol and substance abuse, which I am now seeking help for," he added. "I want to apologise to women who have been victims of any behaviour that has left them feeling uncomfortable or violated. I am also sorry to The Neighbourhood and our fans for letting them down."
