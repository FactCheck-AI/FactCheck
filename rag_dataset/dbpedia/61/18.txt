Sample

The LTS sample is a randomly selected sample of families who represented the full range of socioeconomic status (SES) and racial/ethnic diversity within the metropolitan area (Louisville, Kentucky, USA) at the time of recruitment. Approximately 80% of the participants are European-American, 18% are African-American and the remaining 2% are of mixed or Asian ancestry. Occupations of heads of households, converted to Duncan’s scores for SES, represented the entire distribution of social class, with the average score on the 100-point scale equal to 46.9 (SD = 26.9; score range typical for middle-level clerical workers). Special efforts were made to retain families that were recruited into the study. Less than 10% of the sample withdrew from the longitudinal study during the first 3 years. The sample includes 24% male monozygotic (MZ) pairs, 19% female MZ pairs, 17% male dizygotic (DZ) pairs, 18% female DZ pairs and 22% opposite-sex DZ pairs. The sample is 51% female. Blood typing was used to assign zygosity.

Data collection was also done on a small sample (n = 147) of children of twins (COT). In that sample, the same measures were collected as were collected for the twins in the larger study.
