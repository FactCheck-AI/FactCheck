The Judiciary has two types of certified documents that report a person’s traffic case history: traffic abstracts and traffic court reports. Traffic abstracts, traffic court reports, and driver history records are all available for purchase at the Traffic Violations Bureau located at Honolulu District Court and at all other District Court locations.

What is a Traffic Abstract?

Pursuant to Hawai`i Revised Statutes (HRS) Section 287-3, a certified traffic abstract shows “all alleged moving violations and any convictions resulting therefrom, arising from the operation of a motor vehicle and any administrative license revocation. Since parking and equipment violations do not appear on the traffic abstract so it is sometimes called an “abbreviated” abstract.

Traffic abstracts are usually used for insurance, employment, and other such purposes.

Traffic abstracts are available at District Courts on all islands.

To obtain an abstract, provide the individual’s full name. The date of birth and driver’s license number should also be submitted. Providing the date of birth and driver’s license number assists the clerk in providing the correct abstract or report, especially when individuals have the same name. If only the name is provided and the search results in more than one record with the same name, the requestor may have to purchase all records with the same name. A release form is required to obtain an abstract of a juvenile’s record.

Traffic abstracts may be requested by mail. Include a self-addressed stamped envelope, along with a money order or cashiers check for $20 (payable to District Court), and the individual’s full name, date of birth and driver’s license number. The request should be mailed to the District Court in your circuit. Personal checks are not accepted.

Each traffic abstract costs $20.

What is a Traffic Court Report?

A traffic court report (sometimes called a “complete” abstract) is provided as a convenience to individuals who want a case record history that includes equipment and parking citations in addition to the information contained in the traffic abstract.

The traffic court report is provided only to the individual in person at District Court, after verification of identity with a picture ID. Traffic court reports may not be ordered by mail.

Each traffic court report costs $1.00 for the first page and 50¢ for each additional page.

Bulk Electronic Traffic Abstracts

Bulk Electronic Traffic Abstracts are available via a service provided by the state Internet Portal.

How long will the case information stay on my record?

HRS Section 287-3 requires that Traffic Violations Bureau abstracts contain “all alleged moving violations.” In addition, for state sanctioning purposes, Hawai`i courts must retain at least ten years of information about certain moving violations.

Federal commercial driver’s license regulations require that the State be able to report information about drivers from the time the federal law became effective in the mid-1990s. See 49 U.S.C. 31301 et seq. Some of the reportable information must be kept for 55 years.
