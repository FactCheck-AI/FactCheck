Vivien Leigh stars in this spectacular film adaptation of George Bernard Shaw’s play, which at the time of its making, was the most expensive and elaborate film ever made in Britain. The play describes Caesar’s years in Alexandria and the overthrow of Cleopatra’s brother, Ptolomy, who occupies the Egyptian throne. This magnificent screen adaptation of this story of greed, war, passion and love, due to its superb script, acting and photography will remain one of the true classics of British film-making.
