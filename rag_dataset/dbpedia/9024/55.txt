Bonerama, the funk-rock brass band from New Orleans, hit up The Funky Biscuit in Boca Raton, FL earlier this week. The 20 year-old band’s brass section isn’t an addition, but rather front and center in all their songs.

Bonerama, a band not afraid to tackle challenging covers, took a leap on Thursday night and covered the Led Zeppelin classic, “In My Time of Dying.” Where Jimmy Page would have shined with a guitar solo, the members of the brass section all take a turn to lead the jam.

Bonerama welcomed Anders Osborne to the stage for a monster jam that included “Junco > Lovelight > Ya Ya > I’m Walking.” Perpetual Groove guitarist Brock Butler joined Bonerama and Osborne for “I’m Walking.”
