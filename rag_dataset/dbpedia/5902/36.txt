Director Martin Scorsese is well-known for his epic films, but he might be taking things to a new level through how long Killers of the Flower Moon is.

Collaborating with long-time partners Robert De Niro and Leonardo DiCaprio once more, Scorsese’s latest movie takes viewers back to the U.S. in the 1920s.

As per the film’s synopsis, “Members of the Osage tribe in the United States are murdered under mysterious circumstances in the 1920s, sparking a major F.B.I. investigation involving J. Edgar Hoover.”

With the film due to be released worldwide on October 20, 2023, how long is Killers of the Flower Moon in the first place?

Scorsese has publicly defended his runtime for Killers of the Flower Moon, stating in an interview with Deadline, “The risk is there, showing in a theater in the first place. But the risk for this subject matter, and then for running time. It’s a commitment. I know I could sit down and watch a film for three or four hours in a theater, or certainly five or six hours at home. Now, come on.

“I say to the audience out there, if there is an audience for this kind of thing, ‘Make a commitment. Your life might be enriched. This is a different kind of picture; I really think it is. Well, I’ve given it to you, so hey, commit to going to a theater to see this.’

“Spending the evening, or the afternoon with this picture, with this story, with these people, with this world that reflects on the world we are in today, more so than we might realize.”
