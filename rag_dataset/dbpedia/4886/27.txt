Republican Charlie Baker has been elected governor of Massachusetts, defeating Democrat Martha Coakley and three independent candidates to reclaim the state's top political office for the GOP.

Baker, 57, is the former CEO of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. He worked hard to reach out to independent and Democratic voters and women as he tried to project a more moderate image than four years ago, when he lost to incumbent Democratic Gov. Deval Patrick. Patrick opted not to seek election to a third term.

Baker also had to overcome a few self-inflicted stumbles and criticism from Coakley and Democrats that he was out of touch with ordinary voters.

Baker's win puts the governor's office back in Republican hands for the first time since Gov. Mitt Romney's term ended in 2007.
