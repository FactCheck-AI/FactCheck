Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) dominated the religious and political life of the Netherlands for nearly half a century, and his ideas continue to inspire an international school of thought. A prolific intellectual and theologian, he founded the Free University in Amsterdam and was instrumental in the development of Neo-Calvinism. He was also an active politician, serving as a member of Parliament in the Netherlands beginning in 1874 and serving as Prime Minister from 1901 to 1905. His passion was to faithfully understand and engage culture through a Christian worldview. The most famous example is his articulation of the doctrine of common grace. His work has influenced countless others, including Francis Schaeffer, Cornelius Van Til, and Alvin Plantinga.

Talked delivered at the Anglican Way Institute Conference on Christ and Culture hosted by Church of the Holy Communion in Dallas, Texas. Church of the Holy Communion is a member of the Reformed Episcopal Church, Anglican Church in North America, and is the Cathedral of the Diocese of Mid-America and is led by Bishop Ray Sutton. The Anglican Way Instituteâ€™s Summer Conference employs Anglican worship, prayer, teaching, practical instruction, and fellowship as they seek to form the essentials of the Anglican Way of serving Christ amongst the next generation of Christian leaders.
