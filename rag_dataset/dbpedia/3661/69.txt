The Legendary Duo: Cheech and Chong

Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, known collectively as Cheech and Chong, are a Vancouver-based comedy duo who rose to global fame in the 1970s and 80s. Their journey began at a 'Hippie Burlesque' show in a strip club called Shanghai Junk, where they met and quickly formed a comedic partnership. After gaining popularity in local venues, they moved to Los Angeles to seek broader exposure.

In the early 1970s, they released their self-titled debut album, which was a commercial and critical success in North America. Hits like "Sister Mary Elephant" and "Basketball Jones" soon followed. However, it was their 1978 film Up in Smoke that truly catapulted them to stardom. The movie grossed over $44 million at the box office and has since become a cult classic, beloved by stoners and comedy fans alike. The duo continued their success with films like Nice Dreams (1981) and Still Smokin’ (1983), and their 1985 album Get Out of My Room featured the hit song "Born in East L.A."

In the 1990s, Cheech and Chong explored new avenues, including television and animation, even lending their voices to an episode of the hit animated TV series South Park. With their uproarious humor and unforgettable antics, they revolutionized the way we view and celebrate cannabis culture.
