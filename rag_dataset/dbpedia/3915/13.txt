Gautham Menon’s Neethane En Ponvasantham is a romantic journey of two childhood friends Varun and Nithya played by Jiiva and Samantha. In an interview Jiiva said, “This movie can be the story of all. In fact I felt that most of the scenes were taken from my own life. My wife and I were childhood friends and later got into a serious relationship. Neethane En Ponvasantham is more or like the same.”

Neethane En Ponvasantham also has Santhanam, Anupama Kumar and Ravi Prakash in supporting roles. Isaignani Ilayaraja is composing the music for the film and MS Prabhu is helming the camera.
