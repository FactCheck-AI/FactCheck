Jeff Oster is an American musician who specializes in trumpet and flugelhorn. He is a three-time winner of the Independent Music Awards and ten-time winner of the Zone Music Reporter Awards (formerly NAR LifeStyle Music Awards).

The combination of Osterâ€™s deeply felt melodies, eclectic grooves and exotic textures make his music an improvisational triumph more in the spirit of jazz fusion.
