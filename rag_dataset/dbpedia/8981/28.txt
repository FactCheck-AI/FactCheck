In a hurry? Any streaming service that offers the ESPN channels will provide good coverage of the UEFA Women’s Euro:

The UEFA Women’s Euro is an event that has been increasing in popularity at an impressive rate the last few decades. And its 2022 edition is expected to receive significant interest as well.

In the US, ESPN owns the broadcasting and streaming rights to this competition. In 2022, ESPN will showcase two matches, including the final. And 21 games will be featured on ESPN2, including the opener between England and Austria, which will be simulcast on ESPNU as well.

UEFA Women’s Championship

The UEFA Women’s Championship, the official name for this event, has been held since 1984. That year, four teams played in home-and-away semifinals and a final. It resulted in Sweden edging past England. Both sides won, 1-0, at home, and the Swedes took the penalty shootout that followed the second leg in Luton, England, by a 4-3 margin.

However, only three other sides have claimed this competition’s trophy in the decades since. The Netherlands also won one (2017). Norway has secured this event’s top spot twice (1987 and 1993). But Germany has been the powerhouse country, having taken it down on eight occasions, including six straight times from 1995-2013. The first two occurred in 1989, as West Germany, and 1991, after that country unified.

Structure

All of the UEFA countries that wish to enter a team in qualifying for the Women’s Euro may do so, and the majority of them do. For Women’s Euro 2022, 47 of UEFA’s 55 associations took part in the qualification process. They battled for 15 spots. England, the 48th, proceeded right to the competition as the host.

At the event itself, the 16 teams were divided into four four-team groups with the top two in each advancing to the knockout phase and, for the two most successful sides, playing in a quarterfinal, semifinal, and final.
