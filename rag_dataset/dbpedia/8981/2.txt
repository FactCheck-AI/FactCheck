Other games of note against England: The Lionesses’ most memorable victory over France came in the Women’s EURO 2017 quarter-final, when Jodie Taylor’s solitary goal ended a winless run against Les Bleus which stretched all the way back to 1974.

Interesting information: After beginning his coaching career with former club SC Draguignan in his native France, Hervé Renard became manager at then League Two side Cambridge United in 2004. Four wins in 25 games saw his contract terminated halfway through the season but Renard made a great impression on the players and staff, with former player Shane Tudor comparing the transformation made at The U’s to that of Arsene Wenger at Arsenal.

Renard has since gone on to achieve great success in the men’s game. In 2012 he guided Zambia to their only African Cup of Nations win before lifting the trophy again with the Ivory Coast three years later.

In 2018 he led Morocco into their first World Cup in 20 years and in 2022 his Saudi Arabia side created one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history when they beat eventual winners Argentina 2-1 in their opening match of the group stage.

Other games of note against England: Sweden defeated England on penalties in the first-ever Women’s European Championship final in 1984, following 1-0 wins for each side over two legs. Sweden were also victorious over the Lionesses in the EURO 1988 semi-finals and the third place play-off at the 2019 World Cup.

Interesting information: Many of the Sweden players will be well known to fans of the Barclays Women’s Super League – after all, more than a third of their 2023 World Cup squad were playing in England at the time of the selection (8), only one less than in their native Sweden.

Like his French counterpart, Sweden head coach Peter Gerhardsson also has an impressive pedigree since becoming an international manager. Since taking charge of Sweden in September 2017, Sweden have reached at least the semi-finals in all four tournaments, finishing runners-up at the 2020 Olympic Games, in third place at the last two World Cups, and fourth at EURO 2022.
