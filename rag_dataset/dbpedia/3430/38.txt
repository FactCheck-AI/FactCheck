Drottingholm Palace, the largest residence of the Swedish Royal Family near Stockholm, is the home of the Chinese Pavilion, one of the most remarkable ôchinoiseriesö anywhere in the North of Europe--not only because of the size and splendor of its collections, but because this exquisite pleasure palace, constructed in the middle of the 18th century, offers the experience of the exotic idyll, so poignant a sentiment of the rococo age. The collection includes many original objets dÆart from the Far East, some of great rarity: clay and porcelain figurines, lacquer and metal work, textiles, curios and useful household objects., English, Year1974, Illust.
