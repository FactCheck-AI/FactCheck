The Killing Fields

He was a reporter for the New York Times whose coverage of the Cambodian War would win him a Pulitzer Prize for international reporting. But the friend who made it possible was half the world away with his life in great danger… This is the story of war and friendship, the anguish of a country and of one man’s will to live.

The Mission

Deep in the jungles of South America two men bring God to a native tribe, one a Jesuit Missionary, the other a reformed slave trader. After years of struggle together they find themselves faced with an agonising choice: obey Papal dictate and abandon the mission, or remain to defend the Indians they cherish.
