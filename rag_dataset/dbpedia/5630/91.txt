Caption

Juana “MC J.B.” Burns and Danna Birks of J.J. Fad are pioneers of West Coast rap and went a long way in establishing Compton’s Ruthless Records. Their single “Supersonic” was released when the women were teenagers, and was one of five nominees in the first ever hip-hop Grammy category in 1989, bringing national attention to West Coast hip-hop and paving the way for subsequent groups like NWA to emerge as leaders in hip-hop. MC J.B. had this jacket made at the famous Slauson's Swap Meet in Compton.
