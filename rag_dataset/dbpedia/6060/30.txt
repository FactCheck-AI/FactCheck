Earlier this month, it was confirmed that It Ends With Us had been pushed back to an August 9 release date, having initially had its 2023 release date moved to earlier this year due to last year's Hollywood strikes. There, it was slated to be released in February, before being pushed to June and now August.

The movie is based on the bestselling 2016 novel , which itself was inspired by the relationship between her mother and father.
