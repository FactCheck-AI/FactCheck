Biography

Herman Brood (pronounced "Brode" /bro:d/; Zwolle, November 5, 1946 – Amsterdam, July 11, 2001) was a Dutch musician, painter and media personality. Brood was the Dutch personification of sex and drugs and rock 'n roll.

After playing piano in Cuby and the Blizzards and several other bands since 1964, Brood started his own group, Hermand Brood and His Wild Romance, in 1977. The band had their first hit single, Saturday Night, in 1978. But even more than his music, it was his frank statements in the press about sex and drug use that made Herman Brood famous in the Netherlands. For a while in the early Eighties he was romantically involved with similarly outrageous German artist, Nina Hagen, with whome he appeared together in the movie Cha Cha. Brood relished the media attention and became the most famous hard drug user of the Netherlands. In the 1990s he took up painting and became as successful as a painter as he was as a musician.

By 2001, however, Herman's body was destroyed by alcohol and drugs. When it transpired that he had only a few months left to live, Herman took matters into his own hands and, depressed by the failure of his drug rehabilitation programme, committed suicide on July 11 by jumping off the Amsterdam Hilton.
