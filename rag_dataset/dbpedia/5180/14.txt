Sacred Heart is a small unincorporated community located in southeastern Pottawatomie County. Established in 1879 by Father Isidore Robot as a Catholic mission on the Citizen Potawatomi Nation reserve land, the community was originally named Sacred Heart Mission. The name was changed to Sacred Heart in 1888, shortly before the area was opened to settlement by non-Native Americans.

The Catholic church mission was built in Gothic Revival style in 1914. The Sacred Heart Mission Site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
