Burnout Dominator, EA's latest entry to the famed racing series, is getting a little bit bigger on PSP. New downloadable content is available for the game, available via in-game wi-fi (see video, above). For those without wireless internet, a quick visit to EA's official site will give you access to a brand new track, "Carnival City." It certainly looks great, and the price makes it all the more worthwhille.
