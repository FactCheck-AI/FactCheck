Recently PMZ has come up with a company Slogan! What better way to celebrate it than to release a T Shirt that fully encompasses the slogan in its entirety! Here we have the Keeping All Z's Alive Tee! The Slogan is placed at the top near your shoulders because I know thats where you feel all the weight of Keeping you Z alive, and the Z generations vertically down the back, also where you feel pain due to reaching down to pick up that 10mm you drop on the floor all the time....

With every purchase you help support funding to more merchandise, restocking, and new projects/products for our Z's!

Add you Instagram username at checkout for a shoutout on our story! send a picture of you rocking the merch to our instagram @Pakmanz and will post you on our story!

Thanks for all the Support and remember lets work together in "Keeping All Z's Alive" ....
