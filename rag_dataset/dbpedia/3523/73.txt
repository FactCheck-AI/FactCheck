Handsome English actor Ralph Forbes (1904 – 1951) started his film career in the British cinema before he became a Hollywood star of the 1920s and 1930s. Later he turned into a noted Broadway actor.

Mexican and American actress Dolores del Río (1905–1983) was a Hollywood star in the 1920s and 1930s, and one of the most important female actresses of the Golden Age of Mexican cinema in the 1940s and 1950s. Del Río was the first major Latin cross-over star in Hollywood and was considered one of the most beautiful faces that have emerged in Hollywood cinema. She also appeared in several European films.
