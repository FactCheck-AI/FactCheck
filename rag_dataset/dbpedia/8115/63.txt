Vinyl reissue of the debut solo album from the legendary Lionel Richie. Originally released in 1982 whilst he was still in the band The Commodores.

Lionel Richie (1982) is the U.S. quadruple-Platinum release that announced Richie was more than capable of connecting with millions of fans both new and old with his name appearing alone on the marquee. Alongside co-producer James Anthony Carmichael, whom he had previously worked with while in the Commodores, Richie crafted the template for his Eighties success via the emotional weight behind the chart-topping ballad “Truly”, the upbeat horn-driven accents on the chorus of “You Are”, and the overall vocal panache on “My Love”, which also featured background vocals from a favoured collaborator, Kenny Rogers. (Richie wrote Rogers’s massive 1980 #1 crossover hit, “Lady”).
