Abstract

This is the MySQL Workbench Reference Manual. It documents the MySQL Workbench Community and MySQL Workbench Commercial releases for versions 8.0 through 8.0.38.

MySQL Workbench is developed and tested with MySQL Server 8.0. MySQL Workbench may connect to MySQL Server 8.4 and higher but some MySQL Workbench features may not function with those later server versions.

MySQL Workbench platform support evolves over time. For the latest platform support information, see https://www.mysql.com/support/supportedplatforms/workbench.html.

For notes detailing the changes in each release, see the MySQL Workbench Release Notes.

For legal information, including licensing information, see the Preface and Legal Notices.

If you have not yet installed the MySQL Workbench Community release, please download your free copy from the download site. The MySQL Workbench Community release is available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.

For help with using MySQL, please visit the MySQL Forums, where you can discuss your issues with other MySQL users.
