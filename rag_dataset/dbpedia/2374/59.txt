The History on the Hill Interpretive Center tells the story of the land on which Carillon Historical Park sits—its geological history, its settlement by the prehistoric Hopewell people, and its use as a segment of the Miami and Erie Canal. Featuring a number of exhilarating tunnel slides and the Archeology Adventure Zone, History on the Hill has become a popular spot for guests of all ages.

Complete with picturesque walking trails, wild flowers, idyllic shelters, historical artifacts, geological remnants, and a breathtaking bird’s eye view of Carillon Historical Park and the city of Dayton, the Moraine Trails are the Park’s best-kept-secret.

The History on the Hill exhibit highlights the evolution and cultivation of the Carillon Historical Park property and the remnants of the quarantine hospital and ancient Hopewell earthen enclosure that once stood on the grounds.
