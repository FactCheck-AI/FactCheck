The Walt Disney Company has bought Tapulous, the popular iPhone and iPad video game start-up company of an Australian entrepreneur.

Australian Tapulous co-founder Andrew Lacy, from Melbourne, now lives in Silicon Valley in the United States.

The company is famous as the maker of the Tap Tap series of music games for Apple's mobile devices.

The series has over 35 million downloads on Apple's App Store, making it one of the most successful free game series ever on the platform.

Disney Interactive Media Group president Steve Wadsworth says Tapulous is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the group's mobile games division.

"We welcome the Tapulous team to the Disney family and look forward to integrating their popular games into Disney's offerings," he said.

Financial terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.
