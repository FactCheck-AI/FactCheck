Doohey, Dowey, Dowie, Duffey, Duffie, Duhig, O’ Duffy, Ó Dubhthaigh

The name Duffy is an Anglicisation of the Irish Ó Dubhthaigh, from the Gaelic “Dubhthach” meaning ‘the dark one’. There were originally several septs of Ó Dubhthaighs from which the modern Duffy name, and its variations, are descended, located in counties Donegal, Monaghan and Roscommon. Many of the Duffy clan historically had strong links with the church, and produced a succession of distinguished abbots and bishops. Duffy is now the most common name in Co. Monaghan.

The hand knit Duffy sweater has a honeycomb centre panel, flanked by cable, honeycomb rope and moss-filled diamonds on either side. The honeycomb stitch symbolises work, cable represents good luck and diamonds represent wealth. This beautiful Aran sweater has been hand knitted in the traditional báinín (pronounced ‘baw neen’) colour, the natural white of the wool. It comes to you complete with a clan history and crest. It is made of 100% pure new wool, is water repellent and breathable. It has been hand crafted in the traditional Irish style, and, with care, will last a lifetime.
