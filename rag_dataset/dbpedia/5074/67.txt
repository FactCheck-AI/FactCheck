It wasn't the most pleasant of circumstances, but Don Johnson was reunited with all of his children as they came together to remember his father Wayne. The 67-year-old took to his Instagram page to share a rare family picture of all his children on Monday, including Fifty Shades actress Dakota Johnson, 27, his daughter with ex-wife Melanie Griffith, and Jesse Johnson, 34, who he shares with ex Patti D'Arbanville, as well as Grace, 17, Jasper, 14, and Deacon, 11, who he has with wife Kelley Phleger.

In the caption he simply wrote: "My Beautiful children. At our farm. Grampa Wayne RIP." Fans were quick to heap praise on the lovely snap, with one commenting: "Such a beautiful blended family says a lot about the mums that everyone gets along." Another added: "How precious children are. Gorgeous photo @donjohnson." A third post read: "Beautiful family. So sorry for your loss. May your good memories bring you comfort as you grieve."

Meanwhile, it seems Don and his ex Melanie have stayed on great terms as the Hollywood actors celebrated Christmas together in December. Melanie, 59, took to her social media pages to share pictures of her "extended family". She captioned the sweet photo: "The whole Griffith-Johnson-Banderas-Hedren-Phleger-Bauer family Such a Merry Merry Christmas!!!! #familyforeverandever #breakingtherules." The mother-of-three also shares daughter Stella, 20, with ex Antonio Banderas and had 31-year-old son Alexander with her first husband actor Steven Bauer.
