Splits

Stopping in the name of no love, Supreme diva Diana Ross, 55, and her husband, Norwegian businessman Arne Naess, 59, announced April 30 that they are divorcing after 13 years of marriage. No reason for the split was given, but according to a statement, the couple ”will remain great friends.” They have two sons, Ross, 11, and Evan, 10; the singer also has three daughters from previous relationships.

Lawsuits

Well-preserved crooner Tony Orlando, 55, filed a breach of contract suit against similarly high-gloss colleague Wayne Newton, 57, April 28, in Kansas City, Mo. The suit is the culmination of an acrimonious split between the two ex-friends that began last December when Newton, according to court papers, locked Orlando out of the Branson, Mo., theater they used jointly for their performances. Orlando also accuses Newton of breaking verbal agreements, misrepresenting the financial condition of the theater, and illegal wiretapping. Newton was unavailable for comment.
