In before the flood of âOMG, Epitaph are totally shit because they sign bands that donât sound like Pennywise, OMGâ. Good, now thatâs out of the way we can talk about Sing It Loud, a fantastic little pop group straight out of Minnesota whoâve been making some serious waves across the US of A, and on the back of their Epitaph debut - Come Around â it isnât hard to see why. Taking their cues from current scene darlings All Time Low, SIL have crafted a highly enjoyable record that overcomes its lack of originality by delivering feel-good, memorable songs.

The synth laced intro of âIâve Got A Feelingâ sets the tone for the remainder of the record. If youâre in search of some deep and meaningful musical message then you need to keep looking, however youâve come to the right place if short and sharp pop numbers are your thing. Although âWeâre Not Afraidâ follows the same musical template as its predecessor the vocal contribution falls a little short, but you need not worry, as the follow up (the albumâs title track) picks up the slack and shows why Sing It Loud have made such an impact in such a short amount of time.

Much to the dismay of my workplace colleagues, âDonât Save Meâ is the kind of song that burns its way into your consciousness upon the first listenâ¦ tough days if sugar coated pop-rock isnât your bag, but what can you do! âGive It Upâ doesnât have the same instantaneous appeal as the aforementioned track however itâs slightly restrained delivery does show off a different side to the bandâs still developing songwriting, while âMPLSâ showcases one of the groupâs strongest choruses to date!

âNo One Can Touch Usâ isnât as energetic as the previous tracks, which isnât necessarily a bad thing, it just would have been cool to see Sing It Loud keep up the momentum up through the recordâs mid-section, though âMarionettesâ does make a valiant effort at picking up the pace again. The soaring vocals of âOver Youâ are sure to be staple of SILâs live show, while âFade Awayâ continues in a similar fashion, leaving the ridiculously catchy âBest Beating Heartâ to close up shop.

Thereâs definitely a few filler tracks on offer here, however taking into account the bandâs age (average of nineteen) and the fact that this is their first legitimate release I think itâs safe to say that weâll be hearing a lot more from the Sing It Loud camp over the next few years.
