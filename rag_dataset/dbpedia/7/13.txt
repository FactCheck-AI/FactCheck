Brentidae Acratini from Mitaraka Massif, French Guiana: a data review (Insecta, Coleoptera, Curculionoidea). A list of Brentidae Acratini collected during a field trip conducted in 2015 in the Mitaraka Massif (c. 2°14’N, 54°27’W), in French Guiana, is given. Two new species are described: Parateramocerus teko n. sp. and Neacratus viridis n. sp. A new synonymy is proposed: Proteramocerus affinis Soares & Dias, 1971, n. syn. of Proteramocerus enervatus Kleine, 1927. This last taxon is transferred to the genus Parateramocerus Mantilleri, 2015, leading to the new combination Parateramocerus enervatus (Kleine, 1927) n. comb. Its discovery in the Mitaraka Massif is a new record for French Guiana; it is also newly recorded from Peru. Fonteboanius lamellipes Senna, 1893 is recorded for the first time from French Guiana.

A small group of nine nominal species belonging to the genus Neacratus Alonso-Zarazaga, Lyal, Sforzi & Bartolozzi, 1999 is studied in detail from a morphological point of view. Lectotypes are designated for Brentus obtusus Lund, 1800 and Nemocephalus fulgidus Kleine, 1928. Three new synonymies are proposed: Nemocephalus brevicostatus Kleine, 1922 n. syn. for Brenthus obtusus Lund, 1800, Nemocephalus longiceps Perroud, 1853 n. syn. for Brenthus famulus Boheman, 1840, and Nemocephalus fulgidus Kleine, 1928 n. syn. for B. famulus Boheman, 1840. A new species, Neacratus pascali n. sp., is described from French Guiana. New country records are provided for Neacratus obtusus (Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Grenada, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela), N. puncticeps (Sharp, 1895) (Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela), N. guatemalensis (Senna, 1893) (Belize, Colombia, El Salvador), N. deplanatus (Sharp, 1895) (Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Mexico, Panama, Venezuela) and N. famulus (Paraguay). A phylogenetic analysis carried out on this group shows it forms a monophyletic lineage included in a clade containing most of other species of Neacratus, of which it is the type species; it is therefore not justified to create a new generic name. The possible polyphyletism of the genus Neacratus as a whole and the development of an excessively long rostrum in some male Acratini are discussed.

A group of 10 species belonging to the Neotropical tribe Acratini Alonso-Zarazaga, Lyal, Bartolozzi & Sforzi 1999, is shown to be monophyletic by a phylogenetic analysis based on 48 morphological characters. A new genus, Pertusius n. gen., is described, based on three derived characters of external and genital morphology: venter of prorostrum of males with fine median longitudinal carina, base of elytra with deep pit at the place of insertion on mesonotum, and proximal sclerite of endophallus more or less horseshoe-shaped. Eight species were previously known and, according to former authors, belonged to the genera Acratus Lacordaire 1865 [Pertusius apicalis (Sharp 1895), n. comb., P. errabundus (Kleine 1927), n. comb., P. extrarius (Kleine 1927), n. comb., P. fidus (Kleine 1927), n. comb. and P. telesi (Soares & Meyer 1959), n. comb.] and Proteramocerus Kleine 1921 [Pertusius chalcites (Perty 1832), n. comb., P. filum (Sharp 1895), n. comb., and P. laevis (Germar 1824), n. comb.]. Four new synonymies are proposed: Proteramocerus disparilis Soares & Dias 1971, n. syn. for Acratus apicalis Sharp 1895; Teramocerus laevigatus Boheman 1840, n. syn. for Arrhenodes chalcites Perty 1832; Acratus extraordinarius Kleine 1927, n. syn. for Acratus errabundus Kleine 1927; Proteramocerus diringshofeni Soares & Dias 1971, n. syn. for Acratus filum Sharp 1895. Two new species are described: Pertusius guyanensis n. sp. from French Guiana, and P. mexicanus n. sp. from Mexico (Yucatán Peninsula). Pertusius apicalis is newly cited from Bolivia and Peru, P. chalcites from Argentina and Paraguay, P. extrarius from Ecuador, P. fidus from Peru and P. telesi from Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela. An identification key to species of the genus is provided.
