attracted attention with its brightly coloured shoes, the unusual "drive lugs" under the ball of the foot and its pioneering achievements in the natural running movement. The company name goes back to Sir Isaac Newton, whose third law: "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction" was essential for the development and namesake of Newton sole technology. Newton Running is on fire for endurance sports. In order to support athletes in the best possible way, Newton has always placed a special focus on technologies and innovations. The patented Newton Action/Reactionâ„¢ sole technology, for example, ensures an active running feeling and a natural running style. The mix of cushioning comfort and high energy return helps you run better, faster and healthier. This was exactly the approach Newton Running took from the beginning: to make shoes that are different. Not to be different, but to make every step better. And Newton also wants to " better" the ecological footprint of its shoes. The entire Newton Running shoe collection since 2021 is made entirely from recycled and biodegradable materials. And: Newton Running is the world's first running shoe brand to be certified by the animal rights organisation PETA. All shoes are vegan. Newton Running is also the first running shoe brand to receive B Corporation status. This certification exemplifies the company's efforts to set standards in social responsibility, sustainability and transparency. In Europe, Newton Running is represented by Newton Running Europe (based in Dorsten, NRW). The brand is currently the official running shoe partner of the DATEV Challenge Roth powered by hep, the world's largest long-distance triathlon event.
