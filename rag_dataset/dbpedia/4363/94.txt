.Jackie Kashian in Sunnyvale

Not many people can claim to have heckled the late, abrasive comedian Sam Kinison. Then again, Jackie Kashian (pronounced “Kay-shun”) isn’t just anyone. After the Kinison incident, Kashian hit the open mics, molding her observational comedy to perfection. She’s also the host of two podcasts, The Jackie and Laurie Show (with cohost and fellow comedian Laurie Kilmartin) and The Dork Forest, an interview show exploring humanity’s deepest fandoms. Her latest album, 2021’s Stay-Kashian, is a 57-minute riot covering the Covid lockdowns, being the Godzilla of allies, and the dangers of reaching underneath hotel beds. (MW)
