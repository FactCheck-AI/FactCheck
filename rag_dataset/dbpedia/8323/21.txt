Jimmy PageÂ by Jimmy PageÂ is the official photographic autobiography, personally created by JP himself to tell his story for the first time.

Originally conceived as a hand-bound limited edition of 2,500 numbered and signed copies, in the spring of 2010Â Jimmy Page by Jimmy PageÂ became the fastest-selling book in Genesis Publications' 40-year history. Now Genesis and Jimmy Page have created a more accessible and affordable printing of the book, known as The Open Edition.

"I've been asked on a number of occasions to do a written book and I thought of the other side of the coin. I thought it would be unique to have an autobiography in photographs." -Â Jimmy Page

Jimmy has chosen every one of the 650 photographs. There are many rare finds, such as Led Zeppelin playing an impromptu gig in a nightclub in Jersey, or double-exposure shots of Jimmy and Brian Jones by Ian Stewart. Jimmy chose one of his favourite portrait shots for the book cover: a 1977 passport photo, shot by Neal Preston on board Led Zeppelin's private tour plane.

Over two years in the making, this 512-page volume documents Page's musical journey, from 13-year-old choirboy to Sixties session musician, through The Yardbirds to Led Zeppelin and beyond. In the form of captions, Jimmy has narrated the story of his legendary career andÂ The Open Edition has been updated to bring the story of JP's remarkable life up to present day.
