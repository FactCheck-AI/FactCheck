The General Convention, which would decide the fate of Texas, met at Washington in March 1836. People revere Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site as the site of the signing of the Texas Declaration of Independence on March 2, 1836. Thereafter, despite great personal risk, the delegates continued meeting until they had drafted a constitution and established the new nationâ€™s first lasting government. The picturesque Washington-on-the-Brazos State Historic Site is located on the Brazos River. The expansive grounds provide a beautiful setting for picnicking, sightseeing, and birdwatching. The Star of the Republic Museum, Independence Hall, and Barrington Plantation offer the visitor a unique insight into the lives of the people who established the Republic of Texas.
