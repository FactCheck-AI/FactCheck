I thought B2B was his Tman code name? Whatever happened to him? Hasn't posted in years. BTW his benders are slick.

They look like some good benders...From what I've read Bob made a heavy duty model, but not exactly sure just what it will bend...Trying to find Bob Custers contact info.

I just visited with Bob Custer and ask him about the benders. He said he no longer makes them a fella named Bob Best is now making them. I have no idea if Mr Best is here on Tman or not.

He also said to say "Hi!" to all his T-man friends
