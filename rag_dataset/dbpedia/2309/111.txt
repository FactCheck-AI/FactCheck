The origins of South Indian music are traced to prehistoric times. Carnatic music owes its name to the Sanskrit term Karnātaka Sangītam which denotes “traditional” or “codified” music. The trio of Tyāgarāja (1767-1847), Shyama Sastri and Muttuswami Dīkshitar, described as the “Trinity” of Carnatic music popularised this form of music.

Most compositions in the Carnatic music have three parts to their body. The first or two thematic lines of the song are referred as ‘Pallavi’, which are often repeated in each stanza. Pallavi is usually followed by two more lines called ‘Anu Pallavi’, which is sung in the beginning and sometimes also towards the end of a song, but not necessarily repeated after each stanza or ‘Charanam’.
