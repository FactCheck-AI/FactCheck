Workforce easily own the Epsom Derby, Britain's most important race in the hands of champion jockey Ryan Moore (left) at Epsom Downs today.

He was seven lengths clear of second horse At First Sight, a complete outsider at 100/1 who was in the race as a pacemaker for the top Aidan O'Brien horses. O'Brien's favorite Jan Vermeer finished fourth

Workforce is trained by Sir Michael Stoute and Moore's win meant he took the two classics on offer, the Epsom Derby today and the Oaks on Snow Fairy yesterday.

They are his first classic successes.
