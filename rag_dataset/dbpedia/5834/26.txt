Tina Turner once attempted suicide to escape her ex-husband’s abuse.

In the R&B icon’s upcoming memoir, “My Love Story,” Turner recalled that while her former husband Ike Turner almost caused her to end her own life, her current husband Erwin Bach saved it. The “Proud Mary” singer explained in detail that her marriage with Ike from 1962 to 1978 was “defined by abuse and fear, not love, or even affection” and how he felt the need to control her “economically and psychologically,” so she could never leave him. Ike was the one who insisted on having Turner — real name Anna Mae Bullock — take his surname.

“I said I didn’t want to change my name and wasn’t sure I wanted to go out on tour,” Turner wrote. “First, he was verbally abusive. Then, he picked up a wooden shoe stretcher. Ike knew what he was doing. If you play guitar, you never use your fists in a fight. He used the shoe stretcher to strike me in the head — always the head. I was so shocked I started to cry. Ike ordered me to get on the bed. I hated him at that moment.”
