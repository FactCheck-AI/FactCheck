For the first time since 1976, there was no change in the Olympic track cycling program. The men contested eight events – kilometre time trial, match sprint, individual pursuit, team pursuit, and points race, keirin, Madison, and Olympic sprint; and the women competed in four events – 500 metre time trial, match sprint, individual pursuit, and points race. The track events were held at the indoor Olympic Velodrome, with a 250.0 metre all-weather wooden-surfaced track.

Australia was the dominant nation in track cycling at Athina, winning five gold medals. Great Britain and Russia won two events, with Canada, Germany, and New Zealand winning one each. Two riders who would become much known for road cycling won gold medals, as Bradley Wiggins (GBR) won the individual pursuit and Stuart O’Grady (AUS) won the Madison. Wiggins would defend his individual pursuit title in 2008, and ended his Olympic career with eight medals and five gold medals. On the roads, he would be best known for winning the 2012 Tour de France.
