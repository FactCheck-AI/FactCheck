The film opens at Playland Amusement Park, located at 2901 East Hastings Street in Vancouver, British Columbia. I attended one of their Halloween nights a few years ago to get these pictures.

They do have a roller coaster at the park, but it was greatly expanded via CGI and most of it was done with green screen. I also took a pic of the real ride queue vs. the set they created for the movie.

The school was shot at Vancouver College at 5401 Hudson Street. (Although according to Google streetview, the first building has been demolished since the pictures were taken.

The tanning salon was located at 657 East 15th Avenue. The store was closed at the time, so no screen-matching pics on this one.

The drive-thru scene was accomplished by adding a façade to an existing building at 131 12th Street on the Queens Avenue side of the building in New Westminster, British Columbia.

Although IMDB says differently, the police station was shot at Burnaby City Hall, located at 4949 Canada Way in Burnaby, British Columbia.

I’ll be honest, not sure on this one as this was supposed to be the park for the end of the film, but I didn’t venture around it to find the exact spot. This is Deer Lake Park in Burnaby.
