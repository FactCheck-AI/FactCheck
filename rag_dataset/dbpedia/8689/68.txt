Is Leona Lewis vegan?

Yes, Leona Lewis turned vegan in 2012, but was a vegetarian from the age of 12. She was even named PETA's Person of the Year for 2008!

According to Vegan First, ‘She’s an ethical vegan and also funds an animal sanctuary called Hopefield in Essex. Once, when she was offered a £800,000 offer by Harrods, she clearly declined it the day she got to know that they sell fur products.’
