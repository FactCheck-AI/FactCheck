Having acquired FRCO LRAM and LTCL, he became a teacher in the Slough and High Wycombe localities and was for some time teaching music at Oakdene School, Beaconsfield. In 1950, he was appointed Organist at St. Mary’s Beaconsfield, a post which he held for forty-four years, retiring in 1994 due to declining health.A founder member of the Buckinghamshire Organists’ Association, he served on the committee from 1963 and was elected Chairman 1984-1987. His outstanding service was recognised in 1991 by being made an honorary member of the association.Sadly, Tom passed away in February 1997.
