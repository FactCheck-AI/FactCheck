Universal Music Group (UMG) is the world's largest music company. It has operations in 60 countries.

UMG is responsible for managing a vast and diverse catalog of music, including popular artists and record labels such as Capitol Records, Interscope Geffen A&M, and Def Jam Recordings. It is involved in various aspects of the music industry, including distribution, marketing, and publishing.

Just to understand how big UMG is, in 2021 they had approximately 10,000 UMG employees globally. This number includes staff working in various departments, such as marketing, distribution, finance, and human resources, among others.

It is important not to be confused with Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) which is a North American music publishing company and is part of the Universal Music Group.

Submit Your Album to UMG

If you're an unsigned artist, getting signed by Universal Music Group (UMG) is a dream come true for many artists, but it is a highly competitive process. The roster of Universal Music Group includes Ariana Grande, Kendrick Lamar, Queen, Taylor Swift, The Rolling Stones, Post Malone, Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, and many more.

If you just started creating music and you don't have a large number of streams and followers, it is most likely impossible for you to submit your album to UMG and get some attention from the major or its associated labels.

Important to know

The music industry is highly competitive, and the majority of artists signed to major labels do not achieve significant commercial success. According to some estimates, only a small fraction of artists signed to major labels become successful in the sense of selling substantial amounts of records or generating significant income from their music.

In other words, signing to a major label does not guarantee success, but it can provide artists with resources and support that can increase their chances of success.

Major labels have extensive networks, distribution channels, and marketing and promotion budgets that can help artists reach wider audiences and achieve greater success.

Here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of submitting music and getting signed by UMG:

Create a strong body of work:The first step to getting signed by UMG is to have a strong and consistent body of work. This means putting out quality music and building a solid following on social media and streaming platforms, and we are not talking about 1,000 followers or 1,000 streams. Youâ€™ll need to have a fan base, huge amounts of followers, and most likely live shows history with a growing amount of crowd.

Network:Networking is key to getting noticed by UMG or its associated labels.Attend industry events, perform at local venues, and make connections with other artists, industry professionals, and talent scouts.LinkedIn is a great place to start understanding the right personals and A&R working at UMG.

Utilize online platforms:Utilize online platforms like Spotify, Instagram and YouTube to share your music and reach a wider audience. Make sure your online presence is professional and represents your brand well.

Land Sync deals:

Getting your music on a TV commercial, film, or TV show could generate quick exposure to your music and could be a nice shortcut to getting attention from the major labels. Sync music supervisors play a big role in getting your music licensed, and they are responsible for placing music in film, TV, and other media. Reach out to them and send them your music. Make sure your music is commercial enough to be synchronized and licensed.

Get a referral: Getting a referral from someone who is already working with UMG can increase your chances of getting signed. If you know someone who is working with the label, reach out to them and see if they can put in a good word for you.

Be patient, the process of getting signed by UMG can take time, so it's important to be patient and persistent. Keep creating new music and building your following, and don't get discouraged if you don't hear back right away.

Please note that UMG does not accept unsolicited material, meaning they will not receive your demo submissions directly, so it's best to get your music heard by the record labels through a referral or through a talent scout, radio DJ, industry professional, agent, or music supervisor.
