Convenience for Campus Visitors

Founded in 1838 and spanning nearly 9,000 acres, Duke University is a prestigious private research university located in the heart of Durham, North Carolina.

In 1924, well known industrialist James B. Duke established The Duke Endowment to fund hospitals, orphanages, the Methodist Church, three colleges, and a university built around Trinity College. The college was renamed Duke University in honor of the Duke family.

Today, Duke spends more than $1 billion per year on research, making it one of the ten largest research universities in the United States.
