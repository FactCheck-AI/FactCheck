Leopold von Ranke was a German historian who is considered the founder of modern source-based history. He was born in Germany and studied philosophy and theology before becoming a professor and developing an interest in historical research. Ranke emphasized relying on primary sources and detailed analysis of sources to write narrative history. His works, including Histories of Latin and German Peoples and Histories of Servia, established history as a rigorous academic discipline based on sources and facts. Ranke is credited with developing the historical method of detailed, impartial research that established history as an independent field of study.
