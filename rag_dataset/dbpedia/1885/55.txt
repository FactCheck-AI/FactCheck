Mobb Deep is one of the illest hip hop duos of all-time. Hailing from Queensbridge, Queens, the duo included Prodigy and Havoc. In 1993, they released their debut album, Juvenile Hell. It was a solid debut, but it was their second album, The Infamous (1995), that took them to another level. The Infamous featured classics like “Shook Ones (Part II),” “Survival of the Fittest,” and “Eye for a Eye.” “Shook Ones (Part II)” was the most successful song on the album, but “Survival of the Fittest” was a strong follow-up. The Infamous is a classic and those two songs lead the way.
