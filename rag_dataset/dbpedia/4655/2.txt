For the October Meeting, we honor our “Cowboy of the Year” Hoot Gibson. Hoot was a great cowboy who used a lot of humor in his movies.

The movie lineup is:

Hard Hombre (Allied, 1931) starring Hoot Gibson, Lina Basquette and Skeeter Bill Robbins. The film was directed by Otto Brower.

Episodes 2 and 3 of Son of Zorro starring George Turner, Peggy Stewart and Roy Barcroft (a Republic Serial released in 1947).

Trailin’ West (Warner Brothers, 1936) starring Dick Foran, Paula Stone, Gordon (Bill) Elliott. Noel Smith directed this movie and Anthony Coldeway wrote the script.

Jerry Sprague will fill in as the Master of Ceremonies for the Ole Cowpoke during the October meeting.
