In 1997, when Rick Ray (noted director of 10 Questions For The Dalai Lama) visited Vietnam, Cambodia and Burma to produce his landmark film (later narrated on PBS by Martin Sheen), these countries were thought of as sites of war and suffering. Rick Ray truly raises the Bamboo Curtain to shed some light on world's that were hidden from outsiders for many years.
