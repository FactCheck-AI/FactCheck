Seireitei

On the street in front of the house of the captain of the 13th Division 1st Division of Huting.

This is a street full of the flavor of the country of Japan. Since it is midnight, there are no people on the street and it looks very empty and quiet!

At this time, Troya who appeared on this street was stunned!

His head can't react a little bit!

no way!

The last moment he was still in a room full of industrial technology, and the next moment he came here. The scenes are switched so fast that normal people can't react.

When he was slightly relieved, he also keenly discovered some problems.

Here, the speed of his soul dissipating seems to have come to a sudden brake. Although it did not stop, the speed suddenly dropped to the lowest!

He estimated from the bottom of his heart that if he lives here in the future, his soul can live for at least another year.

After got this result, his face couldn't help showing joy!

Don’t think he looked very open-minded to death before, but if he can live, who wants to die?

But... anyway!

Troya scanned the surroundings, with a look of doubt on his face, here... where is it?

Why can his soul dissipate so slowly?

He has served the royal family of King Tik for so many years. During this period, he has encountered many strange things and visited many strange places. But today, this is the first and the first time for him to come to a place that is good for the soul. see!

Fortunately, he clearly remembered that the last scene before he came here was when Arthur came forward and touched him. In other words, Arthur must have brought him here, so it should be safe!

After all, Arthur didn't mean anything to him, right?

And just then, Arthur appeared beside him.

"Hall...Your Majesty, where is this place?" Troya couldn't help asking as soon as he saw Arthur.

Originally he wanted to be called His Royal Highness, but thinking of what Arthur had just said, he decisively switched the title!

Although the name of the country is different, in his heart, the Kingdom of St. Martin is no different from the Kingdom of Tik, so Arthur is no different from the king of the Kingdom of Tik now!

"Here..." Arthur pondered for a moment and asked, "Do you know hell?"

"What! Hell!?" After Troya heard this, his body trembled, and a look of horror appeared on his face.

Although there is no **** legend in this western world, there are **** legends, so when Troya heard Arthur's words, he thought it was hell!

Hell!

After hearing this term, all kinds of bad pictures appeared in his mind, so he was so frightened!

"Relax!" Arthur saw his thoughts, smiled, and said, "This is not the **** you think, but a similar place. It can be said that this is a **** exclusive to the Kingdom of Saint Martin. Those who come and go are also the people who died in the Kingdom of Saint Martin! There is no danger."

"Exclusive hell!?" This time Troya was completely shocked!

It's really a long time to see you!

As the chief steward of the royal family of the Great Sea Route First Kingdom six hundred years ago, what scenes have he never seen, and what scenes have he not experienced?

But the exclusive hell, he has never heard of it in his life, he hasn't even heard it!

"Crack!"

While Troya was still shocked, the door in front of him slowly opened!

"Smelly boy, you don't go to bed most of the night, why did you come to me?" Moto Ryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto said as he opened the door, with a hint of uncomfortable tone in his tone!

Although the **** of death is not tired and does not need to sleep, Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni still kept the habit of his lifetime and went to sleep at night!

Of course, this kind of sleep is not like sleeping, it's more like lying down and resting, but even so, he was a little uncomfortable when he was called by Arthur's thought when he was resting!

However, when he opened the door completely, he left his uncomfortable thoughts behind his head, and looked at Troia with a little surprise!

Because he found Troia, it's a little different!

After the normal people from the Kingdom of Saint Martin come in, no matter how they die before they are alive, their souls are healthy, just like a newborn baby, they can feel full of vitality in their bodies!

But Troya is different. In him, Yamamoto Genryusai Shigekuni felt only the kind of twilight in the life of an old man who was about to die, and it looked like he was about to die!

And he also felt that compared to the ordinary soul in Seireitei, Troya's soul is looser in quality. It looks like a sponge, it looks complete, but it is actually very empty!

Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni looked at Arthur, frowned slightly and asked, "This one next to you is?"

"Grandpa, let's go in first!" Arthur smiled, did not answer immediately, but walked in directly from Yamamoto Genryusai Shigekuni with Troya.

Upon seeing this, Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni showed a helpless expression on his face, and muttered "This stinky boy!" After that, he closed the door and followed.

In the living room.

Arthur picked up the tea set and made a pot of hot tea. After pouring three cups, he began to introduce Troya in detail to Moto Ryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, and also talked about how he met Troya. At the same time, he also briefed Troya about the specific situation of Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni and Seireitei.

"So you are still the heir of the Tike Kingdom?" Yamamoto Motoryusai Shigekuni showed a strange expression on his face.

The king of one kingdom is the heir of another kingdom, and he feels a little weird how to hear it.

"According to Troya, that's right!" Arthur nodded helplessly and admitted.

Although it seemed helpless on the surface, Arthur was still more willing to accept it. After all, the identity of this heir brought him a lot of benefits, and these benefits can really enhance the strength of the kingdom!

In fact, even if he is not, as long as there are so many biotechnology materials, it doesn’t matter if he admits it!

"Gulong!"

Seeing Arthur’s expression of being a good-for-nothing but getting cheap, Yamamoto Genryuzai Shigekuni smiled, and after taking a sip from the teacup, a reminiscence appeared on his face and said, "Speaking of the heir, you still have You can inherit the position of the name of a country of Wano!"

"what!?"

Suddenly, a surprised expression appeared on Arthur's face, and he didn't dare to say anything, "The country of Hezhi...Daimyo?"

The daimyo in the country of Wano is equivalent to the vassals of Arthur's journey through the previous three kingdoms. Although they are not the highest status in the whole Wano country, in fact, in the area controlled by the daimyo, the daimyo is supreme !

"That's right!" Yamamoto Moto Ryusai Shigekuni nodded solemnly, and said seriously, "I'm not fooling you, I really do!"

"What's the matter?" Arthur asked with a puzzled face.

"Actually, more than two hundred years ago, the generation of my grandfather's grandfather, before your ancestor, Majesty Martin, came to Xihai from the country of Wano, was the famous name of the region of Wano, the country of Linghou!" , Yamamoto Genryusai Shigekuni asked Arthur, "By the way, do you know the topography of Wano country?"

"I know, there are several major districts in Wano Country. The most central location is the capital city of flowers. The north and west of the flower city are the Ximei area, and further west is the Guri area!"

"To the southwest of the Flower City is the Tubun area, to the southeast is the Baimai area, and to the northeast is the Linghou. There is also the island of Onijima in the south."

"Among them, the Linghou area belongs to the winter island. The long years of heavy snow makes it extremely cold and unsuitable for human habitation. The population is relatively sparse!" After thinking for a moment, Arthur said all the information about Wano country in his mind. .

"It's good if you know it!" Yamamoto Genryuzai Shigekuni nodded, and said, "At that time, because the weather there was too bad and there were too few people, the ancestors of our family could not stay. I took my family and came to the West Sea with His Majesty Martin who had gone on an adventure at the beginning! Later there will be Saint Martin!"

Speaking of this, Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni stopped, with a chuckle on his face, patted Arthur on the shoulder, jokingly,

"Now I am the only one left in our family. You are my grandson, and I will pass on the identity of your daimyo!"

"Hehe!" Arthur laughed dryly, with a helpless expression on his face.

Two hundred years have passed, and the identity of this daimyo does not exist or not, even if it exists, who will recognize it?

Even if someone admits that, Arthur doesn't want to go to such a place. How nice to stay in Xihai!

After the two chatted for a while, Arthur said sternly, "Okay, Grandpa, let's not talk for now, I have a business deal with you!"

"Well, what's the matter?" Yamamoto Genryusai also became serious.

"It's like this, Troya's current soul, you know, if you continue to do this, even if you stay here every day, you can live for up to a year, so I want him to be a **** of death!" Arthur said in a deep voice.

"What should I do?" Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni said bluntly.

"Wait, I will transfer all the nearby spirits over and pour them directly into his body, and then you will stabilize his soul to prevent the spirits from being poured too quickly and collapse. Grandpa, can you do it?" Ya Se sternly said.

This is the artificial death method he came up with!

In the world of death, there are three related things: Lingzi, Lingli, and Lingli!

Among them, the lingzi is the basic unit, equivalent to the elementary particle, and the smallest particle, which constitutes the entire Seireitei, including the soul and various buildings are all composed of the lingzi!

The more souls a soul has, the more spiritual power, and only when the spiritual power is increased can you cultivate Reiatsu!

The three can be explained with water!

The smallest particles (lingzi) constitute water (spiritual power), and a large amount of water (spiritual power) after pressurization (cultivation), constitutes the offensive high-pressure water (spiritual pressure).

One of the three is indispensable!

There is no water without the smallest particles. If there is not enough water, no matter how much it is pressurized, high-pressure water cannot be formed!

And the **** of death is nothing more than a group of souls with stronger spiritual power than normal souls. Because they have spiritual power stronger than normal people, they can cultivate spiritual pressure and become the **** of death!

The problem with Troya now is that there is not enough spirituality and not much spiritual power, so he can't become a **** of death!

If Arthur wants him to become a **** of death, he must first strengthen his spiritual son, so that his spiritual power increases, so that he can practice Reiatsu and become a **** of death!

It just so happens that Arthur can control everything in the Seireitei, including the spirits in the air and the souls in the Seireitei, so it is not difficult to do this!

But this approach has two difficulties.

First, just like eating, ordinary people need to eat slowly step by step to gain weight over time. Now, what Arthur has to do is to forcibly infuse him with food and let him eat it in one bite. Fatty, this process is very rude, if you are not careful, you will die and burst your stomach, which is very dangerous!

Second, these souls are not his after all, but Arthur forced them in. It will be very difficult to practice in the future.

Of course, neither of these is a problem for Troya.

Although the process is dangerous, if he can not practice to become a **** of death, there will be one year left, so it should be risky for a longer life.

As for slow cultivation, it is not a problem. He couldn't do cultivation originally!

"No problem~www.mtlnovel.com~ I'll leave this small matter to me!" Yamamoto Motoryusai Shigekuni believed himself.

"That's OK!" Arthur smiled and nodded, then turned to Troya and asked, "Are you ready?"

"Alright!" Troya smiled and nodded.

"Hoo---"

After Arthur took a deep breath, his heart moved.

Suddenly, all the souls of the Seireitei came toward Arthur, and then poured directly into Troya's body.

"what---"

After Troya uttered a scream, he tilted his head and fainted immediately, but Lingzi's infusion still didn't stop, and his naked eyes swelled up!

Upon seeing this, Yamamoto Genryuzhai Shigekuni's eyes condensed slightly, and a heavy spiritual pressure gushed out of his body. He wrapped Troya in Tuantuan, and slowly compressed it back, allowing him to regain his original body shape and continue to protect him. Hold him to avoid him being blown up!

After a while.

Arthur stopped when he felt that Troya's spirit was enough for him to cultivate to become a **** of death.

Looking at Troia who had passed out completely in a coma, Arthur instructed Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni, "Grandpa, he will take care of him now. I have something to do. I will go out and take care of it!"

"Success!" Yamamoto Motoyanagisai Shigekuni nodded.

next moment.

Arthur disappeared in Seireitei and appeared in the power cabin where he was before!
