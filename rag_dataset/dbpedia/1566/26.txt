The paper takes a closer look at the career of the Silesian-born urban-planning architect Lotte Stam-Beese. This female architect became famous not only in the Netherlands, but also in the circles associated with CIAM, for her designs for modern post-war housing districts in the city of Rotterdam. An initial basis for Stam-Beese’s career was laid in the thirties when she worked at Bohuslav Fuchs’s architectural firm in Brno. The author also focuses on her work at this firm and her other activities in Czechoslovakia. The article is based on various sources consulted in archives in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ukraine, the United States and the Netherlands.
