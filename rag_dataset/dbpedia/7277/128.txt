This open source icon is named "avant window navigator" and is licensed under the open source GPL v2 license. It's a colored icon. It's available to be downloaded in SVG and PNG formats (available in 256, 512, 1024 and 2048 PNG sizes).

It's part of the icon set "Ardis Icon Theme", which has 1,161 icons in it.

If you need this icon available in another format, it should be pretty straight forward to download it as an SVG image file, and then import it into apps like Crello, Easil, Pablo or Visme. Converting it to an ICO, JPEG or WebP image format or file type should also be pretty simple (we hope to add that feature to Iconduck soon).

This icon can be used for both Personal & Commercial purposes and projects, but please check the license to see if the designer is requesting attribution (for example, a link back to their website).
