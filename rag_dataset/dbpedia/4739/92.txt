Johannesburg-based investment manager, Stanlib Asset Management Ltd has revealed its intention to buy into engineering and construction company Mota-Engil Africa which intends to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange before the end of the month.

Stanlib said it wants to invest in the Portuguese conglomerate subsidiary to tap into the growing infrastructure demand in the building and construction sector in Africa which is spurred by mining and energy companies on the continent.

Although the amount of money to be invested remains undisclosed, portfolio manager at Stanlib, Thabo Ncalo told the media that the company considers Mota-Engil a good investment.

Mota-Engil Africa is a subsidiary of the Portuguese conglomerate Mota-Engil which has been expanding its business in Africa in the last couple of years to tap into the booming growth of the African economy.

Chairman of Mota-Engil Africa, Gonçalo Nuno Gomes de Andrade Moura Martins believes the company is well positioned to take advantage of the burgeoning opportunities in the African region.

Last month, it revealed plans to float at least 25 percent of its share capital in a public offering on the London Stock Exchange.

As at 2013, the company which began operations on the continent in 1946 had revenues of $1.35 billion and an Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) of $330 million.

Stanlib on the other hand is largely owned by Standard Bank Group Ltd, one of the joint bookrunners of Mota-Engil Africa’s initial public offering on the LSE. The other bookrunners are Espírito Santo Investment Bank, Millennium BCP and La Caixa

Ncalo however says Standard Bank’s investment decisions on Mota were independent.
