Britannia Pricing Strategy

Food production is a highly competitive sector. Competition is at the heart of Britannia's marketing strategy and price strategy.

Also, because the significant sector is price-sensitive middle-class individuals, Britannia is forced to compete on price. Britannia strives to bundle its products, which lowers the cost of its products. This is notably evident in their items made for family packs. The pricing strategy of Britannia allows businesses to make more money from customers who are prepared to pay more for healthier products and perks. Britannia's prices are comparable to those of its competitors, mainly Parle's, and they are practically identical.

Britannia Place Strategy

Britannia employs an extensive distribution network following the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) model, strategically appointing distributors to ensure its products are widely available across various markets. The company boasts a strong presence in urban areas and is actively working to enhance its reach in rural regions, addressing the unique challenges of distribution in these areas. Britannia effectively utilizes modern trade channels, partnering with major retail chains such as Big Bazaar and D Mart to maintain a prominent presence in high-traffic retail environments. Britannia has also expanded its market share internationally through strategic foreign deals and joint ventures, including collaborations with companies like Peek Frean in the UK and acquisitions such as Parryâ€™s, enhancing its global reach.

Britannia Promotion and Advertising Strategy

Britannia employs various strategies in its promotional marketing mix, including television commercials, print advertisements, and billboards. Britannia has negotiated deals with celebrities to market its brand. However, the deals have varied depending on the product. The sports industry accounts for a more significant portion of its promotional operations. Cricket bats with the Britannia emblem, which international players approve, are an essential advertising tool. Britannia also markets its product as "vital for excellent health," which appeals to consumers who are more concerned about the nutritional content of what they eat.

Britannia Segmentation Targeting and Positioning (STP)

Segmentation

Segmentation aids in comprehending the many types of clients present in the community and the characteristics linked with each category.

Kids, adults, and youth are the three groups of demographic segmentation. There are Treat fruit rolls and Tiger biscuits in the Kids category, while in the Adult category, there are Good Day and Cream Crackers. Youth biscuits include Little Hearts and Cream Biscuits.

Targeting

Following segmentation, targeting is how the organization chooses which consumer categories it wants to serve.

Britannia has spent the last 100 years focusing on the next generation of children and the elderly through a variety of goods. The Britannia Tiger is low-cost and aimed at low-income individuals, whilst the Britannia Marie Gold is aimed at families. Treat fruit rolls are intended for use by youngsters on rare occasions.

Positioning

Positioning is the final phase of the process. After determining the client it wants to target, the corporation selects what sort of messaging or attitude to take while selling the product.

Britannia has persuaded moms to buy Tiger biscuits for their children, Little Hearts as a snack for teenagers, and Good Day as a daily cookie that brings joy to everyone's life.
