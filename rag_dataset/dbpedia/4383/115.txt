Canadian film producer and distributor ThinkFilm, known for putting edgy and acclaimed indie productions such as Shortbus and Born Into Brothels into theatres, has been sold to a U.S. film financier.

The Canadian-based company announced the decision in a statement on Tuesday, adding that producer and financier David Bergstein had alsoalready purchased Capitol Films, a European production company that specializes in international projects.

The two acquisitions will create a "formidable new force in the independent marketplace," ThinkFilm said.

Financial details were not released.

Jeff Sackman, ThinkFilm's Montreal-born president, CEO and founder, said the sale allows the company to remain based in Canada.

"We're a Canadian-initiated company based in Canada but we decided to operate in the volatile waters of the U.S.," Sackman said in an interview.

"This sale represents a reverse brain drain, in a way. It's a matter of nationalistic pride that I get to stay in Canada. I really didn't want to live in New York or L.A. and this proves you can be successful in this business and stay here, in a better country," said Sackman, a former Cineplex and Lionsgate Filmsexecutive.

Established about five years ago, ThinkFilm has developed a name for itself as a Canadian success story, with multiple Academy Award nominations and one win in its young history.

In addition to Shortbus and the 2005 best documentary Oscar-winner Born Into Brothels, ThinkFilm's credits include Where The Truth Lies andThe Assassination of Richard Nixon, the documentaries Murderball, The Aristocrats and Spellbound, cult films Strangers with Candy and Awesome: Iâ¦ Shot That, and recent titles Tideland, Half Nelson, Everything's Gone Green and Citizen Duane.
