Speedy West was inducted into the Pedal Steel Guitar Hall of Fame as one of the instrumentâ€™s most innovative performers. He was able to apply his unique style to country, jazz, and popular music. As a driving force on classic recordings with Jimmy Bryant, Speedy was also a long time product endorser for Fender Guitars. As a well respected gentleman, Speedy never lost his farm boy feeling and would sit and chat about music as much as his love of ranching. His NAMM Oral History interview was completed on May 17, 2002.
