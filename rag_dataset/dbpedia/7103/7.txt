Analyst house, Gartner Inc., has released their 2018 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise High-Productivity Application Platform as a Service. Gartner recognizes the importance of high-productivity application as a service (hpaPaaS) for enterprises and small to medium-sized businesses. These hpaPaaS clouds are simpler to use than an aPaaS provider, as they require less knowledge of programming.

Due to businesses struggling to manage the demand for low-code applications, digital business requirements and skill set challenges, hpaPaaS continues to grow across enterprise IT.

Definition

Gartner defines Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) as an application infrastructure functionality enriched with cloud characteristics and offered as a service. Application PaaS (aPaaS) is described as an offering that support app development, deployment and execution in the cloud. High-productivity aPaaS (hpaPaaS) provides rapid application development (RAD) features for development, deployment and execution in the cloud. The RAD features are often referred to as “low-code” and “no-code” support.

hpaPaaS solutions provide support for User Interface (UI) capabilities via responsive web and mobile apps, orchestration of pages, business process, built-in database and on-button deployment.

“In particular, note that the related areas of business process management (BPM) and mobile app development have some characteristics of high-productivity development,” Gartner adds.

The Solution Providers

In this report, Gartner evaluates the strengths and weakness of 20 hpaPaaS providers that they considers most significant in the marketplace, and provides readers with a graph (the Magic Quadrant) plotting the vendors based on their ability to execute and their completeness of vision. The graph is divided into four quadrants: niche players, challengers, visionaries, and leaders.

The 20 hpaPaaS providers selected for this year’s report are: AgilePoint, Appian, Betty Blocks, bpm’online, Caspio, Fujitsu, Kintone, Kony, MatsSoft, Mendix, Microsoft, Oracle, OrangeScape, OutSystems, Pegasystems, Quick Base, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Trackvia, and Zoho.

Added to the Magic Quadrant this year was: AgilePoint, bpm’online, MatsSoft, Microsoft, OrangeScape and PegaSystems.

Business Process Management Providers

As you may have noticed, many of the solution providers listed above are either BPM and/or workflow management solution providers or have BPM capabilities embedded within their offerings. This is because BPM software solutions are an integrated set of technologies that coordinate people, machines and things. These software suites use actionable, real-time insights from operations intelligence to extend the orchestration and automation of adaptive business processes.

AgilePoint, Appian, bpm’online, OrangeScape, MatsSoft, Pegasystems, Trackvia and Zoho all have BPM offerings, and if you haven’t guessed already, they all offer low-code or no-code BPM software solutions, drawing the correlation between this Magic Quadrant to business process management solutions.
