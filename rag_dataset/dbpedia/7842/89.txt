Top-ranked Nardin Academy High School provides an enriching academic experience, enabling students to develop their talents and nurture their potential while becoming women of integrity and compassion.

From classes in Latin and Robotics to Journalism and AP Studio Art, our experienced faculty and staff provide students with countless opportunities.

After outperforming state exams, Nardin Academy stepped away from the New York State Regents curriculum. As an independent school, we have the freedom to use a variety of teaching methods, project-based learning and assessment tools. Our cascading block scheduling allows for longer class times, enabling you to investigate subjects more deeply, work with faculty during office hours and collaborate with your classmates. 100% of Nardin graduates are accepted into 4-year colleges and universities and receive, on average, more than $30 million per year in scholarships and grants. Our upper school consistently outpaces Western New York, state and national averages on SAT, ACT and Advanced Placement exams.

We invite to you explore our curriculum to the left. Serving high school girls and their families during such a formative stage is a privilege. Our experienced faculty and guidance staff look forward to facilitating inspired introspection and supporting girls from day one through graduation.
