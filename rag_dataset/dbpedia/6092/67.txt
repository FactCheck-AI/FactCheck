Artem "Terror" Novikov is a fan of the football club "Dynamo" (Kyiv), a representative of the "North Company" team.

Artem Sergeyevich Novikov was born on February 8, 2002 in the city of Kyiv. He studied at the Kyiv secondary comprehensive school #256 and the capital Lyceum #9, after which he entered the University named after Borys Grinchenko for the specialty "Rehabilitationologist".

Artem grew up as a very active and creative child. He liked to draw, record himself on a dictaphone, fantasize. He was very close to his grandmother, who from childhood taught the boy to be sensitive to animals, give way and help old people, act justly and protect the weak. From the window, one could always distinguish his sonorous voice from among the crowd of children under the windows. Practiced aikido, visited the pool. Thanks to the class teacher of the junior classes, Sorokiniy Maria Panasivni, together with the whole class, was involved in the folk singing ensemble "Poppy Blossom". Therefore, the years in the junior classes were very saturated with Ukrainian traditions.

Relatives remember that Artem was very fond of Flash and his speed as a child, so he often tried to outrun the tram. After another question "Am I really faster than a tram?" a decision was made to send Artem to athletics and running. This is how his sports career began. Many competitions, the spirit of rivalry gradually prepared him for the next stage in life - that of a fan.

In 2019, he joined the then still young Dynamo collective "North Company". Together with his friends, he participated in football-related events, where he always showed his best side, showing his skills and indomitable character in many fan skirmishes, outings, training sessions and in the "forest".

Friends remember Artem as an extremely cheerful person who inspired optimism in everyone around him, and his belief in the best motivated him to new achievements. Any kind of sport was easy for Artem, he could do both volleyball and boxing with equal enthusiasm. Unfortunately, he did not have time to reach the professional level, although he had the potential and was very eager for it, performing in the category of mixed martial arts.

In the last weeks before the start of the great war, the "Dynamo" fan movement anticipated various options for the development of events, conducted training sessions, communicated with teammates related to shooting ranges and the culture of handling weapons. When the enemy moved from several directions at once, "Terror" was one of those who took up arms from the first days. He joined the ranks of the Azov battalion of the TrO, which would later become part of the 3rd OShBr.

After the successful defense of the capital, the fighters were in the Zaporozhye direction, and from the first days of 2023, they entered the battle for Bakhmut. His brothers saw in Artyom a strong and courageous person, a true friend who could be relied on in any situation. His teammates were with him, who went through more than a dozen football-related adventures side by side, and now defended Ukraine together. They say that "Terror" was always ready to go first and was sure of victory, no matter how many enemies stood in front of him.

On January 11, 2023, fighters of the 2nd Assault Battalion of the 3rd OShBr encountered an enemy group in the village of Bila Hora, near Bakhmut. A close battle began, in which Artem Novikov, covering the reconnaissance group from a machine gun, received bullet wounds incompatible with life. Buried at the Forest Cemetery in Kyiv. Awarded the Order "For Courage" III degree (posthumously).
