Up for closure: this is Newhaven Marine station on 12 September 2014, eight years after boat trains had ceased but technically still open. The girders were declared unsafe and all were later demolished. Although disused it is only now, in 2020, that Network Rail has applied to the Department for Transport for formal permission to close the station. Newhaven Harbour station, only steps away, remains open and the land on which the Marine station stands might be used for aggregates sidings in future.
