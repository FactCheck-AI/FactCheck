1953 - DOUG WHITEFORD

Doug Whiteford driving his Lago Talbot has outclassed the entire field to win the very first motor racing event at this Melbourne street circuit.

This 36 year old Victorian had just won his third Australian Grand Prix in 4 years.

He drove the French built Lago Talbot car in which he also won Bathurst in last year.

It was a comfortable win in the end, By 5 laps in-fact after a tight race with Stan Jones who retired after 55 laps of 64.

Gordon Dobie recalls: The 1956 event sponsored by the Argus Newspaper, The first Australian Newspaper to print colour photos, The paper was purchased by the owner of the Herald and Weekly Times, Sir John Williams and immediately closed it down.

Williams then led a campaign in the 1950's which resulted in racing at Albert Park being banned for the next 38 years.
