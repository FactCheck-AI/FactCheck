Australian Motor Sports (March 1957) reports 3906 running at the Light Car Club of Australia’s two-day Fishermen’s Bend meeting where it completed Event 2, an Orthodox Handicap for Sports Cars but, with 18 starters and a 2-lap gap between start times, the backmarkers were never in the hunt and Phillips finished well back.

In the 15-lap Club Trophy Race on Sunday 10th February 1957, Phillips retired with a blown rear tyre when holding third place behind Doug Whiteford (Maserati 300S) and Paul England (Ausca). 3906 raced with number 36 on this occasion and according to the AMS report, “Phillips (100S Healey) was still in third place not far behind England when a rear tyre blew as he passed the pits, pieces of tyre flying all over the track. The Healey pulled up in a dead straight line.”

Regarded as the most successful 100S racing in Australia at this time, 3906 owed much of its success to the tuning and preparation of Ern Seeliger who took the engine out to near 3-litre capacity, and with assistance of the PBR company, attended to the usually troublesome 4-wheel Dunlop disc brakes.

During Seeliger’s mechanical stewardship, 3906 was always presented for each event in top condition and constant development ensured performance was increased with every outing.

One of the real motor sport characters of the period, Seeliger (known as “The Baron”) was closely involved with Stan Jones, Lex Davison and others and his works, at the rear of 52 Baker Street, Richmond, was a hive of racing car fabrication and preparation activity.

Seeliger also raced, notching up a strong 2nd place to Lex Davison in the 1958 AGP at Bathurst driving the legendary Maybach, by now a third generation development of the Charlie Dean designed car which Stan Jones had made famous.

Of interest, Phillips and Seeliger teamed for the 1960 Armstrong 500 at Phillip Island in a Ford Falcon XK. They did not finish.

And Seeliger, relief driver for Tom Hawkes (Cooper Repco), was no doubt on hand on Monday, 4 March 1957, when 3906 recorded one of its best victories with Phillips winning the 40 lap (82 mile) West Australian sports car race in 105-degree heat and hot windy conditions at Caversham, a dusty 2.2 mile track laid out on a World War 2 airbase some 13 miles from Perth in Western Australia, and noted for one of the more unusual hazards in motor racing; visiting kangaroos!

The ubiquitous Derek Jolly (Decca Special) relinquished the lead close to the finish. According to AMS, April 1957, Jolly “stopped near Olympic Hairpin and was immediately passed by Ron Phillips’s Austin Healey 100S which had been close behind for most of the race. Jolly correctly diagnosed the trouble as a loose battery terminal, immediately rectified same, and proceeded to finish in second place, with J. Wynhoff third.”

Derek Jolly sorting battery lead at Caversham gave Phillips the AGP 40-lap Sports Car race.

In an advertisement for BP fuels, acknowledging the win by Phillips and the 100S, it described the event as “the premier Australian sports car race for 1957.

Phillips qualified 3906 in 5th place in his heat to run the AGP.

3906 was entered to run in the Australian Grand Prix on that same day but, as the “Wangaratta Chronicle” reported, Phillips was close to collapse after the 40-lap sports car race and on the advice of his father, Phillips retired from the Grand Prix.

Phillips was quoted in the same article: “It touched 115 mph on the main straight at Perth,” he said.

“But with the terrifically hot conditions, it was an effort to pull her round the corners.”

On the preceding Saturday (March 2nd), Phillips drove 3906 in Event 2, a 20-lap Qualifying Heat for the AGP. Jack Brabham (Cooper Climax) finished in the lead with Phillips qualifying 3906 for the 1957 AGP in 5th place. Completion of the Qualifying Heat was a pre-requisite to an AGP start.

3906 finished 3rd in a 10-lap sports car handicap, the third event of the two-day programme.

Along with the Cooper T41 of Jack Brabham, 3906 was the first car with four-wheel disc brakes to enter an Australian Grand Prix. It carried number 10 for the AGP meeting.

More Caversham action.

The activities of 3906 and several other Austin Healeys were reported in detail in “The Visor” (WA Motor Sport Journal) of March 31st 1957. The car was referred to in advertisements for BP fuels and Winterbottom Motor Company Limited, the WA distributor of Austin Healey sports cars.

A valuable result for Ron Phillips and the 100S.

Two weeks after the WA campaign, on March 17th, Phillips entered the 100-mileVictorian Tourist Trophy Moomba meeting at Albert Park. Starting from Row 3 of a grid which boasted Bill Pitt’s D-type Jaguar, Doug Whiteford’s Maserati 300S and Tom Sulman’s Aston Martin DB3S on the front row, Phillips got up to 5th position before a dropped valve led to 3906 spinning wildly. A press report noted, “Phillips had no control as the car sped off the track, spun in the dirt and ended its wild run between two trees. Only damage was two bent wheels. Phillips climbed out shaken but unhurt.

The report continued quoting the driver: “The Healey was going like a bomb until it blew up.”

“The availability of parts for his special engine is worrying him.

“The motor is nothing like the normal Austin Healey engine,” he said. “I might have to send to England for the parts.”

His fastest lap was 2min 8.8 seconds, much faster than his 1956 TT times and the fastest lap time by an Austin Healey at Albert Park.

Due to its engine failure, 3906 was a non-starter for the 100-mile Victorian Trophy race, again at Albert Park on Sunday, March 24th.

Tall with sandy hair, Phillips, with helmet added, protruded well above the cockpit surrounds of the 100S in the days when a racing driver’s uniform was usually straight from his working clothes wardrobe.

A fortnight after the Tourist Trophy off-track excursion, Phillips starred at his home track, the Wangaratta airfield circuit in North East Victoria, by winning the sports car scratch race after repairs to his engine were completed literally seconds before the starter’s flag fell.

As the “Wangaratta Chronicle” reported, “The Healey pulled out onto the track for the start of the scratch race with only three cylinders working and as the one minute sign went up mechanics finished work. As the car took off in a cloud of dust a mechanic called out to Phillips, “Hope it comes good during the race.” It did. The purple and white car led every yard of the four laps.”

3906 continued on its way. “Driving his Healey ‘flat to the boards’ Phillips won the sports car handicap from the scratch mark”.

He placed second in a mixed sports and racing car handicap after conceding a 45-second start to the winner and in a final Class Handicap containing a field of the four fastest cars of each class, Phillips again brought 3906 home in first place.

3906 also gave Phillips the sports car lap record when he posted a flying lap of 54.2 seconds “against the old record of 58.1.”

According to the “Border Morning Mail” of 1st April, 1957, “Driver of the day was Wangaratta wizard Ron Phillips. The paper also reported: “most drivers seemed to like the circuit, but as the track was being watered regularly many preferred the dust to the water, which caused them trouble on the tight bends.”

Phillips starred at his home track, Tarrawingee. This is a movie frame courtesy of John Cox.

It was recorded that Phillips also scored a second place in the sedan scratch race driving a stock model 1957 Ford Customline. He had earlier rallied in a Ford Customline in the 1953 Redex Trial with his father, Jack and friend Jack Cox. They finished 138th.

This was the final meeting at the Wangarratta airstrip before the North Eastern Car club relocated its racing activities to a new track at Tarrawingee Sportsground.

Phillips drove both the Maybach (now campaigned by Ern Seeliger) and Cooper-Jaguar for wins at Tarrawingee on April 12th 1959.

In conversation with two of Phillips’s contemporaries, George Williams who first worked at the Parsons & Phillips Ford dealership in 1948 and Bill Gormly who started his apprenticeship in 1950, the racing activities of Jack and Ron were always kept “close to the chest”. George occasionally joined the crew, as did Redex crew man, Jack Cox. Bill Gormly's son, Andrew, is now dealer principal of the multi-franchise Wangaratta dealership.

3906 was garaged either at Wangaratta or with Ern Seeliger in Melbourne and George’s involvement with the car comprised helping “fetch and carry”. He recalled having never sat behind the wheel and he attended only those meetings in Victoria including the Albert Park races in 1956. The 100S was towed, usually behind a Ford Customline; on what both George and Bill agreed was “a terrible trailer”.

At the 1957 Easter meeting in South Australia, 3906 recorded a class record time of 42.86 seconds (Class D – Sports Cars 2001-3000cc) at the SA Hill Climb Championship staged at Collingrove on April 20th.

On Easter Monday, April 22nd at Port Wakefield, 3906 (number 9) was raced by Phillips and finished 5th in Event 4 (Division 1 Scratch Race) covering 6 laps in 7:08 minutes.

Ron Phillips always made an impact at Port Wakefield

In the feature South Australian Trophy, Phillips placed 4th outright covering 15 laps in 17:37 to finish behind Murray Trenberth (Vincent 1000), Jolly (Decca Special) and Bill Pile (MG Special).

In the second round of the 1957 “Winter Cup” series at the Victorian Sporting Car Club’s 24th Templestowe Hill Climb on May 19th, 3906 ascended in a time of 65.50 seconds compared to Stan Jones’ 64.93 a year earlier.

3906 next appeared at the Light Car Club of Australia “Winter Cup” final heat at Rob Roy on June 9th and established another hill climb class record of 28.50 seconds ahead of John Roxburgh’s 100S (29.64)

A week later, 3906 was entered for the Quarter Mile Sprint meeting held on June 16-17th at Fishermen’s Bend, possibly the last time Ron Phillips competed in the Austin Healey 100S which had served him so well.

Whilst Jack Phillips had competed in the AGP in 1937, 1938 and in 1939 at Lobethal in South Australia, he achieved 3rd place in a Ford V-8 powered special, son Ron entered three AGP meetings with no success.

In 1953 at Albert Park he was a non-finisher in an Allard K2. Besides 1957 with the 100S entry, he retired his Cooper Jaguar Type 33 with differential problems in the 1959 event at Longford (Tasmania). However, 1959 saw Ron Phillips crowned the Australian Sports Car Champion and winner of the Australian Tourist Trophy, his efforts supported yet again by the canny Ern Seeliger.

Realising the need for a more competitive car, Phillips advertised 3906 in Australian Motor Sport in July and August 1957.

FOR SALE. Impressive credentials.

Quoting “145hp, 130 mph, less than 5000 miles and modified disc brakes”, the car was sold to South Australian racer, David Harvey in August.
