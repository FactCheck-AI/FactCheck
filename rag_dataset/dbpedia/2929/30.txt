Event

Pro-Palestinian activists are planning to protest in central Copenhagen May 14. Participants plan to gather at 15:30 at Svanemollen station, before marching to the Israeli Embassy on Lundevangsvej. The demonstration comes amid significantly heightened tensions between Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which is likely to boost attendance.

Police will deploy to monitor and facilitate the demonstration. Large numbers of people and associated crowd-control measures, including local road closures and movement restrictions, could lead to localized transport disruptions along the march route. Disruptions are also possible on local public transport, including at Svanemollen station. The gathering is likely to proceed peacefully, but isolated clashes with security forces are possible, particularly if demonstrators become disruptive or attempt to breach police cordons.

Advice

Exercise caution and avoid the demonstration as a routine security precaution and to mitigate associated disruptions. Allow additional time for travel near the demonstration. Leave the area at the first sign of a confrontation. Check public transport schedules for disruptions and allow extra time for travel in the vicinity of any gatherings.
