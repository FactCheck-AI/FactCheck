Thank you for visiting the website of Mikoya Hogaku Academy. I set up Mikoya Hogaku Academy in 2003 to encourage talent and to promote Japanese traditional music, in particular, Koto and Shamisen. Japan has a long history and a rich traditional culture. Koto and Shamisen are part of such Japanese traditional culture. The culture that each country has is invaluable. It will be very sad if we lose our invaluable traditions and culture simply due to our negligence. My ultimate goals are to offer and create the opportunities for people to enjoy and become familiar with Koto and Shamisen music, and to build the foundation so that Koto and Shamisen music is protected and handed down to the next generation. Every April, Mikoya Hogaku Academy holds a recital where the members of Mikoya Hogaku Academy participate. You will be surrounded with Japanese traditional music (Koto, Shamisen, Shakuhachi and Ohayashi) for a whole day. Please feel free to visit our recital (admission free) to listen to and enjoy this aspect of Japanese traditional culture. It would be our pleasure if we could introduce you to a new tradition so that you may enjoy Koto and Shamisen music in your day-to-day life.
