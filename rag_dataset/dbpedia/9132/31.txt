GERMAN EAST AFRICA (1890-1892): pesa = 1/64 rupie

PESA as coin name.

Pesa — historical coin of German East Africa ("Deutsch-Ostafrika" — German possessions on the territory of modern Burundi, Rwanda and Tanzania) at the end of the 19th century.

Pesa was 1/64th of the local rupie — similar to the British Indian rupee, which consisted of 64 pice and was widely used in the mentioned lands.

It was produced in 1890, 1891 and 1892. There is only coin of this denomination — a copper 1 pesa. The total three-year circulation of the pesa, which, by the way, was minted in Berlin, is more than 40 million pieces. In 1904, German East Africa switched to a decimal monetary system — from that time the rupie was divided into 100 heller.

The name of the pesa coin is apparently borrowed from India. After all, it was the Indian rupee (its small changeable coin — pice), before the introduction of its own currency by German East Africa, that performed the role of money there alongside Maria Theresa thaler.
