Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd. is expecting a strong rebound in earnings in its new fiscal year following a decline in fiscal 2017 when the company faced higher production costs.

Net income attributable to Murata fell 6.4% to ¥146.09 billion in the year that ended March 31, from ¥156.06 billion in the previous period.

Basic earnings for the year came in at ¥685.86 per share, down from 2017's ¥733.87 per share, the company said in an April 27 filing.

The Japanese manufacturer of electronic components posted full-year net sales of ¥1.372 trillion, up 20.8% from ¥1.136 trillion in the prior fiscal year. The company attributed the sales growth to increasing demand for electronic components in various applications such as vehicle electrification, as well as higher sales of new components for smartphones.

Full-year operating income fell 19.4% to ¥162.15 billion from ¥201.22 billion, the company reported, citing an increase in production costs due to a delay in launching new products and higher depreciation expenses.

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, Murata is expecting net income of ¥180.0 billion, up 23.2% from fiscal 2017. Full-year basic earnings are projected to be ¥844.08 per share.

Murata expects net sales to increase 14.8% to ¥1.575 trillion in the new fiscal year and operating income to jump 48.0% to ¥240.00 billion.

In projecting its next fiscal year earnings, Murata cited the growing demand for electronic components, mainly in the automotive markets, and for new products in the smartphone market.
