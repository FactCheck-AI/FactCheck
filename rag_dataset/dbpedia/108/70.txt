Marcin Antique is inspired by late 19th-century French types produced by the Fonderie Gustave Mayeur in Paris. The sans-serif family is a fresh interpretation of France’s long tradition of grotesque types.

The typeface looks less polished than most neo-grotesques, yet doesn’t emphasise the quirks of its vintage source material, which leaves Marcin Antique in a nice middle ground. Its characters feature only a minute modulation in contrast.

Marcin Antique 2.0 (Jun. 2022) has new widths, additional weights and completely redrawn italics. The standard width, to which we add the Book, Semibold and Extra weights, consists now of 11 weights (plus italics). Marcin Antique Narrow shares the same number of weights but without italics, and the Condensed and X Condensed versions both have 8 weights, ranging from Thin to Black.
