Q-Free's tolling systems for its Harbour Crossing Tolling contract in Sydney, Australia, have gone live.

The deal has seen Q-Free provide the design, supply and installation of tolling roadside systems for the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel.

The solution encompasses detection, classification and charging. “We are thrilled to have all tolling points now live,” says Silje Troseth, Q-Free's VP of APAC and general manager of Australia.

“This was a particularly challenging and rewarding project as we used technological innovation to preserve the site’s iconic heritage with a seamless solution while addressing the changing demands of an ever-expanding metropolis.”

The crossings unite Sydney's business district and the North Shore, serving over 40 million vehicle crossings annually for drivers, commuters, cyclists and pedestrians.

Around 150,000 vehicles cross each day, making it one of the busiest roads in Australia, Q-Free says.

The Harbour Crossing work is part of the Warringah Freeway Upgrade Project, which aims to smooth flow on one of Australia’s most congested roads.

Q-Free says the initiative promises "a swifter and more convenient driving experience for daily commuters and streamlines toll collection for Transport for NSW, ensuring efficiency and accuracy".
