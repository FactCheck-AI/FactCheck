Q-Free has announced the successful go-live of its new tolling systems for the Harbour Crossing Tolling in Sydney, Australia.

The milestone marks the culmination of an intricate project involving the design, supply, and installation of advanced tolling roadside systems that preserved the integrity of Australia’s most outstanding and immediately recognized engineering structure, the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge.

As the vibrant city of Sydney looks ahead to a future marked by unprecedented growth, the iconic Sydney Harbour Bridge stands at the forefront of innovation. With Greater Sydney’s population set to soar to approximately 6.1 million by 2041 – welcoming over a million more residents than the current figures – the evolution of these landmarks becomes not just a matter of progress but a crucial response to the evolving needs of a dynamic and expanding community.

Revolutionizing crossings

Under the Harbour Crossing Tolling contract, awarded through a rigorous RFP process, Q-Free provided the design, supply, and installation of tolling roadside systems for the Sydney Harbour Bridge and Sydney Harbour Tunnel. This comprehensive solution encompasses detection, classification, and charging, ushering in a new era of seamless and efficient travel for the residents of Sydney.

“We are thrilled to have all tolling points now live,” says Silje Troseth, VP of APAC and general manager of Australia. “This was a particularly challenging and rewarding project as we used technological innovation to preserve the site’s iconic heritage with a seamless solution while addressing the changing demands of an ever-expanding metropolis.”

Essential landmarks, integral solutions

For generations, the Sydney Harbour Crossings have been a major thoroughfare that unites the business district and the North Shore, serving over 40 million vehicle crossings annually for drivers, commuters, cyclists, and pedestrians. In full view of the famed Sydney Opera House, the bridge typically sees more than 150,000 vehicle crossings daily, making it one of the busiest roads in Australia.

The Harbour Crossing work is an integral facet of the Warringah Freeway Upgrade Project, which will revolutionize traffic flow on one of Australia’s most congested and complicated roads. The initiative promises a swifter and more convenient driving experience for daily commuters and streamlines toll collection for Transport for NSW, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. The ripple effect extends to the broader transport network around Sydney Harbour, contributing to a more seamless and connected urban experience.
