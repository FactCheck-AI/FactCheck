Established in 1873, the Rio Tinto Group has evolved from a single copper mine in Spain to a global powerhouse in the mining sector. As one of the world's leading natural resources companies, its operations encompass the extraction and processing of diverse minerals including aluminium, copper, diamonds, gold, iron ore, and uranium. Spanning six continents and 35 countries, Rio Tinto is an influential player in the global mining landscape, contributing to economies, societies, and the supply chains of various industries. The company has its headquarters in London, but a large part of its operations takes place in Australia.

The history of the Rio Tinto Group is a narrative of evolution and expansion. It started in 1873 when a consortium of investors acquired the rich copper mines on the banks of the Rio Tinto River in Andalusia, Spain. Over the course of the 20th century, the company extended its reach globally, investing in a diverse array of mineral interests. A significant restructuring in the 1990s led to the formation of a dual-listed company structure, creating UK-based Rio Tinto plc and Australia-based Rio Tinto Limited.

Rio Tinto's business strategy revolves around owning and operating large, long-life, low-cost, expandable mines, known for their use of technology. Its operations include not just mining but also refining, particularly in the aluminium sector. The company manages an expansive network of mines, processing facilities, and transportation infrastructure. Improving its operations is a key priority for the company, and Rio Tinto continuously seeks new technologies and methodologies to improve its operations.

Some key competitors operating in the same industry are names like Glencore, Anglo American, and BHP.

Australia represents the cornerstone of Rio Tinto's operations, particularly the iron ore-rich region of Pilbara in Western Australia. As the hub of the company's iron ore business, Pilbara boasts the world's largest integrated portfolio of iron ore assets. Additionally, Rio Tintoâ€™s aluminium business, one of the world's largest, is also primarily operated out of Australia. The nation's wealth of natural resources, coupled with a stable political environment and proximity to key Asian markets, especially China, has been instrumental in Rio Tinto's growth and profitability.
