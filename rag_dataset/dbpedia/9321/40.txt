Prescott was founded in 1864 as the Territorial Capital before Arizona even became a state. When gold was discovered, the town drew miners and adventurers seeking their fortune. The World’s Oldest Rodeo got its start in 1888, writing the rules of modern rodeo, and placing its brand indelibly upon the character of Prescott and eventually spawning over 700 professional rodeos in 50 states. Prescott’s history is so colorful and fascinating, that early pioneer Sharlot Hall made it her life’s mission to create a museum and preserve as many documents and memorabilia as she could for future generations.
