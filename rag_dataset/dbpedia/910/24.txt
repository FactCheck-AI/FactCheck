British luxury supercar maker McLaren Automotive said Monroe is expanding its supply of intelligent suspension for the its road car range.

Monroe Intelligent Suspension is a Tenneco brand and an established McLaren supplier after a 10-year association of automaker and supplier which has seen engineers from both organisations work together to develop and deploy innovative suspension technology. The pair first collaborated in 2011 with the introduction of Kinetic suspension on McLaren’s first supercar, the 12C.

It is now expanding on a previous supply contract for its CVSA2 and CVSA2/Kinetic H2 systems.

McLaren chief technology officer Charles Sanderson said: “Our long association with Tenneco has helped ensure that we remain the global benchmark for supercar driving precision and performance.”
