"That thing is stalking us. It's hunting us, and it's not going to stop." RLJE + Shudder have revealed an official US trailer for The Reef: Stalked, another new shark horror movie. The Reef: Stalked is a sequel to Australian director Andrew Traucki's shark movie The Reef from 2010, and Traucki returns to write & direct this one 12 years later. After her sister's murder, Nic, her younger sister and two friends seek solace through a Pacific island kayaking adventure. Hours into the trip the women are stalked by a shark and must band together, face their fears and save each other facing the beast. This movie stars Teressa Liane (from "The Vampire Diaries"), Ann Truong (seen in "Cowboy Bebop"), Saskia Archer, Kate Lister, and Tim Ross. We already posted another trailer a few weeks ago, but this one has some extra shark shots added to it - but none of them really look that good. Opening at the end of July on VOD and streaming on Shudder. Jump in.

Here's the official US trailer (+ poster) for Andrew Traucki's The Reef: Stalked, from YouTube:
