Setting Up the Notebook

This notebook requires Pillow which is a fork of PIL. To install this module run the cell below:

About Item Thumbnails

A thumbnail image is created by default when you add the item to the site. It appears in galleries, search results, contents, and the item page. You can create and load a different image if the default image does not convey the information you want.

In ArcGIS Online, you can drag an image or browse to a file. For best results, add an image that is 600 pixels wide by 400 pixels high or larger with an aspect ratio of 1.5:1 in a web file format such as PNG, JPEG, or GIF. Pan and zoom to what you want to appear in your thumbnail. Depending on the size and resolution of your image file and how far you zoom in to customize the thumbnail, the image may be resampled and scaled when it's saved. If you add an image in GIF or JPEG format, it will be converted to PNG when it's saved.

Finding Missing and Invalid Images

This notebook shows how a user can find images under the 600x400 pixel size for a given user.

Usage

To get a DataFrame that can be queried, set show_image to False. This will return an object that can be further used for analysis. The dataframe reports back the width/height of the image. If an image is missing, the value will be NaN for width/height.

Example: Retrieve All Thumbnails Under 400x300

Item Thumbnails Back as HTML Report

Sometimes just creating a table to see what is there is good enough. By setting show_image to True, the method allows for a quick visualization approach to the thumbnail problem.
