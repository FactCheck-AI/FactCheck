"God Make Me Funky", often erroneously identified as "God Made Me Funky", is a song recorded by American jazz fusion group The Headhunters, from their debut album Survival Of The Fittest. It features The Pointer Sisters, and is well known for containing one of the most sampled drum breaks in history.

Description[]

Music[]

The song begins with a drum fill not dissimilar to that of Bob James' "Take Me To The Mardi Gras", which leads into a funk-inspired drum groove (played by Mike Clark). After a few bars, congas (played by Bill Summers) accompany the drums.

When the drum break ends, a wah-wah guitar riff (played by DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight) starts playing over it. In turn, it is joined by a bass riff (played by Paul Jackson).

Lyrics[]

The lyrics are about wishing for God to make one funky, above even health and wealth.

Sampling[]

Drum Fill[]

Much like Bob James' "Take Me To The Mardi Gras", the drum fill that starts the track off is a very common scratch sample. It has been included on many battle records by itself.
