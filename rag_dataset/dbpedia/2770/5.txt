660 Fifth Avenue has been transformed from the inside out. From new infrastructure and building systems, optimized for tenant experiences and wellness, to an elegant lobby and expansive curtain wall.

The stunning new fa√ßade is reclad in 11x19 ft single-pane glass units, making them the largest ever used on a redevelopment in New York City. 660 Fifth Avenue is defining what it means to work in clarity.
