Shore grew up in Nashville, TN and first appeared as a singer in a nightclub at the age of 14. Her parents raised her to be a genteel woman with a conservative southern background and encouraged education; in 1938 she graduated from University.

She married actor George Montgomery from 1943-1962. The year after her divorce, she became the wife of Maurice Smith for a year. In 1971 she had a relationship with the 18 year-younger Burt Reynolds which lasted until 1975.

At the age of two she suffered from polio. The disease crippled her right leg and a rigorous program was required for recovery. She had a lifetime love of tennis. Shore was known as a talented, charming, gracious, alive and sincere person always interested in everything, a ray of sunshine.
