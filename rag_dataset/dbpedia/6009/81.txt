Armenia has been involved in a 35-year conflict with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh disputed territory and its surrounding areas. While Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, until September 2023, it was predominantly inhabited by an ethnic Armenian population and was controlled by a de facto self-governing administration supported by Armenia. On 16 September, Azerbaijan took control over the region in a one-day lightning military operation, causing more than 101,000 of the region’s 120,000 people to flee to Armenia as at late 2023. The first war between Armenia and Azerbaijan occurred between 1988–1994, resulting in over 25,000 deaths and displacing around one million people on both sides. The second occurred in September 2020 and lasted six weeks before the two countries signed a Russian-brokered ceasefire. As at late 2023, around 70% of the refugees from the latest hostilities resided in Yerevan city and the surrounding marzes (regions) of Armenia. Most resided with pre-existing networks of relatives, while 40% were housed in temporary government-run accommodations. Although the Armenian Government provides some level of shelter and cash assistance, among other services, the refugees still face multiple challenges and needs for shelter, protection, health, and education.
