At less than a mile, the White Tail Trail at Red Top Mountain State Park is a perfect short hike to a great view of Allatoona Lake. If all you're looking for is a leisurely stroll with minimal elevation change, this is a great option and makes an even better add on to the Sweet Gum Trail or longer loop with the Homestead Trail.

Begin at the Visitor Center parking lot (the blue marker on the map). To the left of the entrance to the parking lot is the White Tail and Sweet Gum trailhead. Almost immediately, the White Tail trail splits off to the right, following the white blaze.

Like other trails in the park, the path is wide and easily followed. There is one intersection with a sign pointing you in the right direction. The trail makes it's way to the tip of a narrow peninsula, and as such, there are water views on both sides along the way with plenty of side trails to get out and explore around the water. At just under a mile the trail ends at the edge of the water. Large rocks allow views of Allatoona Lake and make good spots to fish.
