Abstract

Three species of fungi were recorded for the first time from Iran (Amanita virosa,Russula vesca and Russula persicina). The species was collected from the forests of Asalem and Talesh in Gilan Province. Gilan province is located in north of Iran and southwest of Caspian Sea. The three specimens of macroscopic fungi belonged to the Amanitaceae and Russulaceae classes, which are new records for Iranian fungus flora. These species also belonged to the subdivision Basidiomycotina. In this study, the morphological characteristics of these three species are presented.
