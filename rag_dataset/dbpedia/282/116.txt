History

Archaeological findings confirm that Gilan hosted civilisations as old as Marlik and Amlash.

Gilan means the land of Gils and Gils are an Iranian ethnicity who speak in Gilaki dialect.

Gilan was famous as the gateway to Europe in late Qajar era. The province has a prominent role in Iran’s contemporary history.

Geography

Gilan has a high population density as a result of its temperate weather and fertile soil. It’s surrounded by the Caspian sea and Azarbaijan Republic to the north, Zanjan & Qazvin to the south, Mazandaran to the east and Ardebil to the west.

Climate

The province’s climate is temperate and humid. Talesh and Alborz mountains block the moisture from the Caspian sea and keep the humidity high most months of the year.
