Yutao Chen, Ronald J. van der A, Jieying Ding, Henk Eskes, Jason E. Williams, Nicolas Theys, Athanasios Tsikerdekis, and Pieternel F. Levelt

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1094,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1094, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

There is a lack of local SO2 top-down emission inventories in India. With the improvement in the divergence method and the derivation of SO2 local lifetime, gridded SO2 emissions over a large area can be estimated efficiently. This method can be applied to any region in the world to derive SO2 emissions. Especially for regions with high latitudes, our methodology has the potential to significantly improve the top-down derivation of SO2 emission estimates.

Short summary

Short summary

The new MUSICAv0 model enables the study of atmospheric chemistry across all relevant scales. We develop a MUSICAv0 grid for Africa. We evaluate MUSICAv0 with observations and compare it with a previously used model – WRF-Chem. Overall, the performance of MUSICAv0 is comparable to WRF-Chem. Based on model–satellite discrepancies, we find that future field campaigns in an eastern African region (30°E–45°E, 5°S–5°N) could substantially improve the predictive skill of air quality models.

Short summary

A new collection-4 dataset for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) mission has been established to supersede the current collection-3 level-1b (L1b) data, produced with a newly developed L01b data processor based on the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) L01b processor. The collection-4 L1b data have a similar output format to the TROPOMI L1b data for easy connection of the data series. Many insights from the TROPOMI algorithms, as well as from OMI collection-3 usage, were included.

Short summary

Short summary

In the 1980s, measurements at the British Antarctic Survey station in Halley, Antarctica, led to the discovery of the ozone hole. The Halley total ozone record continues to be uniquely valuable for studies of long-term changes in Antarctic ozone. Environmental conditions in 2017 forced a temporary cessation of operations, leading to a gap in the historic record. We develop and test a method for filling in the Halley record using satellite data and find evidence to further support ozone recovery.

Short summary

Short summary

This paper reports on the ground-based validation of the NO2 data produced operationally by the TROPOMI instrument on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. Tropospheric, stratospheric, and total NO2 columns are compared to measurements collected from MAX-DOAS, ZSL-DOAS, and PGN/Pandora instruments respectively. The products are found to satisfy mission requirements in general, though negative mean differences are found at sites with high pollution levels. Potential causes are discussed.

Short summary

Short summary

This paper presents a first validation of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aerosol layer height (ALH) product, which is an estimate of the height of an aerosol layer using a spectrometer on board ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite mission. Comparison between the TROPOMI ALH product and co-located aerosol extinction heights from the CALIOP instrument on board NASA's CALIPSO mission show good agreement for selected cases over the ocean and large differences over land.

Atmos. Chem. Phys. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-39,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-2020-39, 2020

Revised manuscript not accepted

Short summary

Short summary

ALH is one of the major concerns in quantifying aerosol absorption from the ultra-violet aerosol index (UVAI). The UVAI has a global daily record since 1978, whereas a corresponding ALH data set is limited. In this paper, we attempt to construct a global long-term ALH data set derived from the MERRA-2 aerosol fields that can be favorable in interpreting aerosol absorption from UVAI. We also give comments on several satellite ALH products in terms of the UVAI altitude dependence.

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6619–6634, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6619-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6619-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

This paper discusses a neural network forward model used by the operational aerosol layer height (ALH) retrieval algorithm for the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the European Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite mission. This model replaces online radiative transfer calculations within the oxygen A-band, improving the speed of the algorithm by 3 orders of magnitude. With this advancement in the algorithm's speed, TROPOMI is set to deliver the ALH product operationally.

The role of aerosol layer height in quantifying aerosol absorption from ultraviolet satellite observations

Jiyunting Sun, Pepijn Veefkind, Swadhin Nanda, Peter van Velthoven, and Pieternel Levelt

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 6319–6340, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6319-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-6319-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

Single scattering albedo (SSA) is critical for reducing uncertainties in radiative forcing assessment. This paper presents two methods to retrieve SSA from satellite observations of the near-UV absorbing aerosol index (UVAI). The first is physically based radiative transfer simulations; the second is a statistically based machine learning algorithm. The result of the latter is encouraging. Both methods show that the ALH is necessary to quantitatively interpret aerosol absorption from UVAI.

Minimizing aerosol effects on the OMI tropospheric NO2 retrieval â An improved use of the 477 nm O2âââO2 band and an estimation of the aerosol correction uncertainty

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 491–516, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-491-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-12-491-2019, 2019

Short summary

Short summary

The reference OMI tropospheric NO2 product was reprocessed by new aerosol correction parameters retrieved from the 477 nm O2âO2 band over eastern China and South America for 2 years. These new parameters are from different and separate algorithms, allowing improved use of the 477 nm O2âO2 band. All the tested approaches improve the aerosol correction in the OMI tropospheric NO2 product. We demonstrate the possibility of applying an explicit aerosol correction based on the 477 nm O2âO2 band.

Short summary

Short summary

Near-UV AAI is a qualitative parameter detecting the elevated absorbing aerosol layer. A long-term AAI record of satellite observations has the potential to quantify aerosol absorption on a global scale. Our study presents the possibility of retrieving single-scattering albedo with OMI-measured AAI. The comparison with AERONET is satisfactory and further research will be on how the aerosol wavelength-dependent refractive index and aerosol profile affect the quantification of aerosol absorption.

A weighted least squares approach to retrieve aerosol layer height over bright surfaces applied to GOME-2 measurements of the oxygen A band for forest fire cases over Europe

Short summary

Short summary

An approach to estimate the height of aerosol plumes over land from satellite measurements of the oxygen A band is proposed. The method, termed dynamic scaling, forces the retrieval to use spectral points that contain more height information. The method is tested in a synthetic environment as well as with GOME-2A and GOME-2B measurements of wildfire plumes over Europe, with very encouraging results. This method can be easily applied to other aerosol height algorithms using least squares.

Short summary

Short summary

The aim of this paper is to highlight the many successes of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) spanning more than 13 years. Data from OMI have been used in a wide range of applications. Due to its unprecedented spatial resolution, in combination with daily global coverage, OMI plays a unique role in measuring trace gases important for the ozone layer, air quality, and climate change. OMI data continue to be used for new research and applications.

Spatial distribution analysis of the OMI aerosol layer height: aÂ pixel-by-pixel comparison to CALIOP observations

Julien Chimot, J. Pepijn Veefkind, Tim Vlemmix, and Pieternel F. Levelt

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 2257–2277, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2257-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-2257-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Aerosol layer height (ALH) was retrieved from the OMI 477 nm O2–O2 band and its spatial pattern evaluated over selected cloud-free scenes. We used a neural network approach previously trained and developed. Comparison with CALIOP aerosol level 2 products over urban and industrial pollution in east China shows consistent spatial patterns. In addition, we show the possibility to determine the height of thick aerosol layers released by intensive biomass burning events in South America and Russia.

Simultaneous assimilation of ozone profiles from multiple UV-VIS satellite instruments

Jacob C. A. van Peet, Ronald J. van der A, Hennie M. Kelder, and Pieternel F. Levelt

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 18, 1685–1704, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1685-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-18-1685-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Ozone profiles measured by two satellite instruments (GOME-2A and OMI) have been combined with a chemical transport model using data assimilation. The results give a better insight into the global spatial and temporal ozone distribution than either measurement or model results alone. Validation with independent measurements shows biases varying between -5 % and +10 % between the surface and 100 hPa, while between 100 and 10 hPa the biases vary between -3 % and +3 %.

Error sources in the retrieval of aerosol information over bright surfaces from satellite measurements in the oxygen A band

Swadhin Nanda, Martin de Graaf, Maarten Sneep, Johan F. de Haan, Piet Stammes, Abram F. J. Sanders, Olaf Tuinder, J. Pepijn Veefkind, and Pieternel F. Levelt

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 11, 161–175, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-161-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-11-161-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Estimating aerosol layer height in the atmosphere from satellite data in the oxygen A band (758–770 nm) over land is challenging over land, since the surface is generally very bright in this wavelength region. This paper discusses an interplay between the surface and the atmosphere in their contributions to the top-of-atmosphere reflectance spectrum and the consequent biases obtained while estimating aerosol layer height, using synthetic data and real data from the GOME-2 satellite instrument.

Short summary

Short summary

We present a first analysis of UV/VIS spectral measurements obtained with the Spectrolite Breadboard Instrument (developed by TNO, The Netherlands) during the AROMAPEX campaign held in Berlin in April 2016 (campaign supported by ESA and EUFAR). This new sensor was used to measure air pollution in the form of tropospheric NO2 columns. The study focuses specifically on the retrieval of surface reflectances, an important intermediate step towards the final product.

Short summary

Short summary

To evaluate the quality of the satellite-derived NOx emissions, we compare nine emission inventories of nitrogen oxides including four satellite-derived NOx inventories and bottom-up inventories for East Asia. The temporal and spatial distribution of NOx emissions over East Asia are evaluated. We analyse the differences in satellite-derived emissions from two different inversion methods. The paper ends with recommendations for future improvements of emission estimates.

Short summary

Short summary

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) has been flying on NASAâs EOS Aura satellite since July 15, 2004. It has measured the concentration of trace gasses in the atmosphere, like ozone, NO2 and SO2. This article describes the trend in performance and calibration parameters of OMI during 12 years of flight. The degradation of the CCD detectors, solar diffusers, spectral calibration and row anomaly are shown. The instrument shows overall degradation that is better than expected.

Short summary

Short summary

We improve the DECSO algorithm for NOx emission estimates from satellite observations, especially over remote regions. The accuracy is about 20 percent for monthly NOx emissions with a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. We are able to distinguish ship emissions below the outflow of NO2 from the mainland of China.

An exploratory study on the aerosol height retrieval from OMI measurements of the 477â¯ nm O2âââO2 spectral band using a neural network approach

Short summary

Short summary

We have developed artificial neural network algorithms to retrieve aerosol layer height from satellite OMI observations of the 477 nm O2–O2 spectral band. Based on 3-year (2005–2007) cloud-free scenes over north-east Asia, the results show uncertainties of 260–800 m when aerosol optical thickness is larger than 1. These algorithms also enable aerosol optical thickness retrievals by exploring the OMI continuum reflectance. These results may be used for future trace gas retrievals from TROPOMI.

Improvements to the OMI O2âO2 operational cloud algorithm and comparisons with ground-based radarâlidar observations

Short summary

Short summary

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on board the NASA EOS Aura satellite monitors the concentrations of trace gases. The accuracy of such observations relies partly on information on clouds. The OMI OMCLDO2 product derives the cloud fraction and pressure from the observed radiance in the visible. This paper reports on an improved version of this product. Compared to the previous version, the changes in cloud fraction are very small, but the changes in the cloud pressure can be significant.

Short summary

Short summary

We examine changes in SO2 and NO2 over the world's most polluted regions during the first decade of Aura OMI observations. Over the eastern US, both NO2 and SO2 levels decreased by 40â¯% and 80â¯%, respectively. OMI confirmed large reductions in SO2 over eastern Europe's largest coal power plants. The North China Plain has the world's most severe SO2 pollution, but a decreasing trend been observed since 2011, with a 50â¯% reduction in 2012–2014. India's SO2 and NO2 levels are growing at a fast pace.

Impact of aerosols on the OMI tropospheric NO2 retrievals over industrialized regions: how accurate is the aerosol correction of cloud-free scenes via aÂ simple cloud model?

Short summary

Short summary

The interplay between aerosols and the OMI O2–O2 cloud retrieval algorithm is analysed in detail to evaluate the impacts on the accuracy of the tropospheric NO2 retrievals over cloud-free scenes. Collocated OMI NO2 and MODIS Aqua aerosol products are compared over E China, in industrialized areas; the OMI O2–O2 cloud retrieval algorithm is implemented on synthetic study cases dominated by aerosol particles. The resulting biases highlight the need for an improved aerosol correction.

We derived the NOx emissions from the OMI satellite observations. We find a NOx emission reduction of at least 25% during the Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing in 2014. The emission estimate algorithm has detected an emission reduction of 10% during the Chinese Spring Festival. This paper also shows that the observed concentrations and the derived emissions from space have different patterns that provide complimentary information.

Short summary

Short summary

Two methods are compared to retrieve aerosols, formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide in the lower troposphere from ground-based remote sensing observations of scattered sunlight in multiple viewing directions. Observations were done in the Beijing area (2008â2011). The two methods show good agreement with respect to the total amount (vertical column) and reasonable agreement with respect to concentrations near the surface and first-order estimates of the vertical profile shape.

This preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).

Short summary

Short summary

Satellite data were used to estimate urban per capita emissions for 261 major cities worldwide. Three components in tropospheric NO2 data: background NO2, NO2 from urban sources, and from industrial point sources were isolated and then each of these components was analyzed separately. The largest per capita emissions were found at the Middle East and the smallest were in India and South Africa. Urban weekend emissions are 20 %–50 % less than workday emissions for all regions except China.

We establish a simple yet robust relationship between ozone production rates and several geophysical parameters obtained from several intensive atmospheric composition campaigns. We have shown that satellite remote sensing data can effectively constrain these parameters, enabling us to produce the first global maps of ozone production rates with unprecedented resolution.

Short summary

Short summary

This study uses the Community Inversion Framework and CHIMERE model to assess the potential of TROPOMI-S5P PAL NO2 tropospheric column data to estimate NOx emissions in France (2019–2021). Results show a 3 % decrease in average emissions compared to the 2016 CAMS-REG/INS, lower than the 14 % decrease from CITEPA. The study highlights challenges in capturing emission anomalies due to limited data coverage and error levels but shows promise for local inventory improvements.

Short summary

Short summary

The Sentinel-5P satellite operated by the European Space Agency has carried the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) around the Earth since October 2017. This mission also produces atmospheric ozone profile data which are described in detail for May 2018 to April 2023. Independent validation using ground-based reference measurements demonstrates that the operational ozone profile product mostly fully and at least partially complies with all mission requirements.

Geosci. Model Dev., 17, 4983–5007, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4983-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-4983-2024, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Nitrogen dioxide (NOx) is produced by sources such as industry and traffic and is directly linked to negative impacts on health and the environment. The current construction of emission inventories to keep track of NOx emissions is slow and time-consuming. Satellite measurements provide a way to quickly and independently estimate emissions. In this study, we apply a consistent methodology to derive NOx emissions over Germany and illustrate the value of having such a method for fast projections.

Short summary

Short summary

We quantify 2021 methane emissions in South America at up to 25 km × 25 km resolution using satellite methane observations. We find a 55 % upward correction to the national anthropogenic inventories reported to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) under the Paris Agreement. Our estimates match inventories for Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay but are much higher for other countries. Livestock emissions (65 % of anthropogenic emissions) show the largest discrepancies.

Comparing space-based to reported carbon monoxide emission estimates for Europe’s iron & steel plants

Short summary

Short summary

The production of steel coincides with large emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants including carbon monoxide. European facilities are required to report their emissions, which are estimated using a variety of methods. We evaluate these estimates using carbon monoxide concentrations measured using a satellite. We find generally good agreement between our values and those reported but also identify some uncertainties, showing that satellites can provide insights on these emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

Venezuela's Lake Maracaibo region is notoriously hard to observe from space and features intensive oil exploitation, although production has strongly decreased in recent years. We estimate methane emissions using 2018–2020 TROPOMI satellite observations with national and regional transport models. Despite the production decrease, we find relatively constant emissions from Lake Maracaibo between 2018 and 2020, indicating that there could be large emissions from abandoned infrastructure.

This preprint is open for discussion and under review for Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (ACP).

Short summary

Short summary

The 2021 volcanic eruption of Tajogaite on La Palma is investigated using ground-based and satellite measurements. In addition, the atmospheric transport of the volcanic cloud towards Europe isstudied in detail. The amount of SO2 released during the eruption as well as the height of the volcanic plume is in excellent agreement between the different measurements. Furthermore, volcanic aerosol microphysical properties could be retrieved using a new retrieval approach based on Lidar measurements.

Short summary

Short summary

In this study, we developed an advanced retrieval algorithm for tropospheric NO2 columns from geostationary satellite spectrometers, and applied it to GEMS measurements. The DLR GEMS NO2 retrieval algorithm follows the heritage from previous and existing algorithms, but improved approaches are applied to reflect the specific features of geostationary satellites. The DLR GEMS NO2 retrievals demonstrate a good capability in monitoring diurnal variability with a high spatial resolution.

Short summary

Short summary

The 2019 Raikoke eruption (Kamchatka, Russia) generated one of the largest emissions of particles and gases into the stratosphere since the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The Volcano Response (VolRes) initiative, an international effort, provided a platform for the community to share information about this eruption and assess its climate impact. The eruption led to a minor global surface cooling of 0.02 °C in 2020 which is negligible relative to warming induced by human greenhouse gas emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

HARMONIE WINS50 reanalysis data with 0.025° × 0.025° resolution from 2019 to 2021 were coupled with the LOTOS-EUROS Chemical Transport Model. HARMONIE and ECMWF meteorology configurations against Cabauw observations (52.0° N, 4.9° W) were evaluated as simulated NO2 concentrations with ground-level sensors. Differences in crucial meteorological input parameters (boundary layer height, vertical diffusion coefficient) between the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models were analysed.

Short summary

Short summary

Validation of satellite HCHO over the remote marine regions is relatively few and modeled HCHO in these regions is usually added as a global satellite HCHO background. This paper intercompares three satellite HCHO retrievals and validates them against in situ observations from the NASA ATom mission. All retrievals are correlated with ATom integrated columns over remote oceans, with OMI SAO (v004) showing the best agreement. A persistent low bias is found in all retrievals at high latitudes.

Report on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2B observations of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline methane leak

Short summary

Short summary

We analyze Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2B (S-2B) observations of the 2022 Nord Stream 2 methane leak and show how challenging this case is for usual data analysis methods. We provide customized calibrations for this Nord Stream 2 case and assess that no firm conclusion can be drawn from L8 or S-2B single overpasses. However, if we opportunistically assume that L8 and S-2B results are independent, we find an averaged L8 and S-2B combined methane leak rate of 502 ± 464 t h−1.

Pyrogenic HONO seen from space: insights from global IASI observations

Short summary

Short summary

Using IASI global infrared measurements, we retrieve nitrous acid (HONO) in fire plumes from space. We detect large enhancements of pyrogenic HONO worldwide, especially from intense wildfires at Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes. Predominance of IASI nighttime over daytime measurements sheds light on HONO's extended lifetime and secondary formation during long-range transport in smoke plumes. Our findings deepen the understanding of atmospheric HONO, crucial for air quality assessment.

SO2 emissions and lifetimes derived from TROPOMI observations over India using a flux-divergence method

Yutao Chen, Ronald J. van der A, Jieying Ding, Henk Eskes, Jason E. Williams, Nicolas Theys, Athanasios Tsikerdekis, and Pieternel F. Levelt

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1094,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1094, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

There is a lack of local SO2 top-down emission inventories in India. With the improvement in the divergence method and the derivation of SO2 local lifetime, gridded SO2 emissions over a large area can be estimated efficiently. This method can be applied to any region in the world to derive SO2 emissions. Especially for regions with high latitudes, our methodology has the potential to significantly improve the top-down derivation of SO2 emission estimates.

Short summary

Short summary

This study evaluates the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS) HCHO product by comparing its vertical column densities (VCDs) with those of TROPOMI and ground-based observations. Based on some sensitivity tests, obtaining radiance references under clear-sky conditions significantly improves HCHO retrieval quality. GEMS HCHO VCDs captured seasonal and diurnal variations well during the first year of observation, showing consistency with TROPOMI and ground-based observations.

The Antarctic stratospheric nitrogen hole: Southern Hemisphere and Antarctic springtime total nitrogen dioxide and total ozone variability as observed by Sentinel-5p TROPOMI

Adrianus de Laat, Jos van Geffen, Piet Stammes, Ronald van der A, Henk Eskes, and J. Pepijn Veefkind

Short summary

Short summary

Removal of stratospheric nitrogen oxides is crucial for the formation of the ozone hole. TROPOMI satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide reveal the presence of a not dissimilar "nitrogen hole" that largely coincides with the ozone hole. Three very distinct regimes were identified: inside and outside the ozone hole and the transition zone in between. Our results introduce a valuable and innovative application highly relevant for Antarctic ozone hole and ozone layer recovery.

Ammonia emission estimates using CrIS satellite observations over Europe

Jieying Ding, Ronald van der A, Henk Eskes, Enrico Dammers, Mark Shephard, Roy Wichink Kruit, Marc Guevara, and Leonor Tarrason

EGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1073,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1073, 2024

Short summary

Short summary

Here we applied the existing DECSO inversion algorithm to NH3 observations from the CrIS satellite instrument to estimate NH3 emissions. Because NH3 in the atmosphere is influenced by NOx, we implemented DECSO to estimate NOx and NH3 emissions simultaneously. The emissions are derived over Europe for 2020 on a spatial resolution of 0.2° degree using daily observations from both CrIS and TROPOMI. The results are compared to bottom-up emission inventories.

Short summary

Short summary

This manuscript describes a new treatment of the spatial mis-registration of cloud properties for Sentinel-5 Precursor, when the footprints of different spectral bands are not perfectly aligned. The methodology exploits synergies between spectrometers and imagers, like TROPOMI and VIIRS. The largest improvements have been identified for heterogeneous scenes at cloud edges. This approach is generic and can also be applied to future Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 instruments.

Quantifying uncertainties of satellite NO2 superobservations for data assimilation and model evaluation

Short summary

Short summary

Clustering high-resolution satellite observations into superobservations improves model validation and data assimilation applications. In our paper, we derive quantitative uncertainties for satellite NO2 column observations based on knowledge of the retrievals, including a detailed analysis of spatial error correlations and representativity errors. The superobservations and uncertainty estimates are tested in a global chemical data assimilation system and are found to improve the forecasts.

Short summary

Short summary

Instruments for air quality observations on geostationary satellites provide multiple observations per day and allow for the analysis of the diurnal variation of important air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) over large areas. The South Korean instrument GEMS, launched in February 2020, is the first instrument in geostationary orbit and covers a large part of Asia. Our investigations show the observed diurnal evolution of NO2 at different measurement sites.

Short summary

We investigated tropospheric ozone spatial variability and trends from 2005 to 2019 and related those to ozone precursors on global and regional scales. We also investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ozone formation regime in relation to ozone chemical sources and sinks. Our analysis is based on remote sensing products of the Tropospheric Column of Ozone and its precursors, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and total column of CO as well as ozonesonde data and model simulations.

Short summary

Short summary

In this study, we evaluated the GEMS glyoxal products by comparing them with TROPOMI and MAX-DOAS measurements. GEMS and TROPOMI VCDs present similar spatial distributions. Monthly variations of GEMS VCDs with those of TROPOMI and MAX-DOAS VCDs differ in Northeast Asia, which we attributed to a polluted reference spectrum and high NO2 concentrations. GEMS glyoxal products with unparalleled temporal resolution would enrich our understanding of VOC emissions and diurnal variation.

Short summary

Short summary

A new divergence method was developed and applied to estimate methane emissions from TROPOMI observations over the Middle East, where is typically challenging for a satellite to measure methane due to its complicated orography and surface albedo. Our results show the potential of TROPOMI to quantify methane emissions from various sources rather than big emitters from space after objectively excluding the artifacts in the retrieval.

Formaldehyde observations from satellites can be used to constrain the emissions of volatile organic compounds, but those observations have biases. Using an atmospheric model, aircraft and ground-based remote sensing data, we quantify these biases, propose a correction to the data, and assess the consequence of this correction for the evaluation of emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

This study uses model simulations along with multiplatform, multidisciplinary observations and a range of analysis methods to estimate and understand the distributions, temporal changes, and impacts of reactive nitrogen and ozone over the most populous US region that has undergone significant environmental changes. Deposition, biogenic emissions, and extra-regional sources have been playing increasingly important roles in controlling pollutants’ budgets in this area as local emissions go down.

Short summary

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides global analyses and forecasts of aerosols and trace gases in the atmosphere. On 27/06/2023 a major upgrade, Cy48R1, became operational. Comparisons with in situ, surface remote sensing, aircraft, balloon and satellite observations, show that the new CAMS system is a significant improvement. The results quantify the skill of CAMS to forecast impactful events, such as wildfires, dust storms and air pollution peaks.

Short summary

Short summary

The study examines tropical tropospheric ozone changes. In situ data from 1994−2019 display increased ozone, notably over India, Southeast Asia, and Malaysia/Indonesia. Sparse in situ data limit trend detection for the 15-year period. In situ and satellite data, with limited sampling, struggle to consistently detect trends. Continuous observations are vital over the tropical Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean, Western Africa, and South Asia for accurate ozone trend estimation in these regions.

Short summary

Short summary

Natural emissions from vegetation have a profound impact on air quality for their role in the formation of harmful tropospheric ozone and organic aerosols, yet these emissions are highly uncertain. In this study, we quantify emissions of organic gases over Europe using high-quality satellite measurements of formaldehyde. These satellite observations suggest that emissions from vegetation are much higher than predicted by models, especially in southern Europe.

Short summary

Short summary

The vortex-averaged ozone loss over the last 3 decades is evaluated for both polar regions using the passive ozone tracer of the chemical transport model TOMCAT/SLIMCAT and total ozone observations from the SAOZ network and MSR2 reanalysis. Three metrics were developed to compute ozone trends since 2000. The study confirms the ozone recovery in the Antarctic and shows a potential sign of quantitative detection of ozone recovery in the Arctic that needs to be robustly confirmed in the future.

Short summary

Short summary

In a warmer future, water vapour will spend more time in the atmosphere changing global rainfall patterns. In this study, we analysed the performance of 28 water vapour records between 1988 & 2014. We find sensitivity to surface warming generally outside expected ranges, attributed to breakpoints in individual record trends & differing representations of climate variability. The implication is that longer records are required for high confidence in assessing climate trends

Short summary

Short summary

Snow-covered terrain, with its high reflectance in the UV, typically enhances satellite sensitivity to boundary layer pollution. However, a significant fraction of high-quality cloud-free measurements over snow is currently excluded from analyses. In this study, we investigated how satellite SO2 measurements over snow-covered surfaces can be used to improve estimations of annual SO2 emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

Atmospheric bromine destroys ozone, impacts oxidation capacity, and is the main oxidant of mercury into its toxic form. We constrain bromine by remote sensing of BrO from a mountaintop. Previous measurements retrieved 2–3 pieces of information vertically, we apply new methods to get 5.5 vertically and 2 more in time. We compare with aircraft measurements to validate the methods and look at variation in BrO over the Pacific. More information will help chemical models and satellite measurements.

Short summary

We present air quality measurements in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, performed with a newly developed instrument which was installed on a roof of the University of Kinshasa in November 2019. The instrument records spectra of the scattered sunlight, from which we derive the abundances of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde, two important pollutants. We compare our ground-based measurements with those of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).

Short summary

Short summary

The new MUSICAv0 model enables the study of atmospheric chemistry across all relevant scales. We develop a MUSICAv0 grid for Africa. We evaluate MUSICAv0 with observations and compare it with a previously used model – WRF-Chem. Overall, the performance of MUSICAv0 is comparable to WRF-Chem. Based on model–satellite discrepancies, we find that future field campaigns in an eastern African region (30°E–45°E, 5°S–5°N) could substantially improve the predictive skill of air quality models.

Validation of satellite measurements is essential for providing reliable and consistent products. In this paper, a validation method for TROPOMI-SWIR (Tropospheric Measurement Instrument in the short-wavelength infrared) is explored. TROPOMI-SWIR has been shown to be exceptionally stable, a necessity to explore the methodology. Railroad Valley, Nevada, is a prime location to perform the necessary measurements to validate the satellite measurements of TROPOMI-SWIR.

Short summary

Short summary

Using two machine learning models, which were trained on TROPOMI methane satellite data, we detect 2974 methane plumes, so-called super-emitters, in 2021. We detect methane emissions globally related to urban areas or landfills, coal mining, and oil and gas production. Using our monitoring system, we identify 94 regions with frequent emissions. For 12 locations, we target high-resolution satellite instruments to enlarge and identify the exact infrastructure responsible for the emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

A framework was developed to automatically detect plumes and compute emission estimates with cross-sectional flux method (CFM) for biomass burning events in TROPOMI CO datasets using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite active fire data. The emissions were more reliable when changing plume height in downwind direction was used instead of constant injection height. The CFM had uncertainty even when the meteorological conditions were accurate; thus there is a need for better inversion models.

Short summary

Short summary

We present a fast method to evaluate carbon monoxide emissions from cities in Africa. Carbon monoxide is important for climate change in an indirect way, as it is linked to ozone, methane, and carbon dioxide. Our measurements are made with a satellite that sees the entire globe every single day. This means that we can check from space whether the current knowledge of emission rates is up to date. We make the comparison and show that the emission rates in northern Africa are underestimated.

Short summary

Short summary

We use TROPOMI satellite observations to quantify weekly methane emissions from the US Permian oil and gas basin from May 2018 to October 2020. We find that Permian emissions are highly variable, with diverse economic and activity drivers. The most important drivers during our study period were new well development and natural gas price. Permian methane intensity averaged 4.6 % and decreased by 1 % per year.

Vertical information of CO from TROPOMI total column measurements in context of the CAMS-IFS data assimilation scheme

Short summary

Short summary

ECMWF plans to assimilate TROPOMI CO with their CAMS-IFS model. This will constrain the total column and the vertical CO distribution of the model. To show this, we combine individual TROPOMI CO column retrievals with different vertical sensitivities and obtain a vertical CO concentration profile. We test the approach on three CO pollution events in comparison with CAMS-IFS simulations that do not assimilate TROPOMI CO data and in situ airborne measurements of the BB-FLUX campaign.

Short summary

Short summary

Satellite observations provide evidence for CO2 emission signals from isolated power plants. We use these satellite observations to quantify emissions. We found that for power plants with multiple observations, the correlation of estimated and reported emissions is significantly improved compared to a single observation case. This demonstrates that accurate estimation of power plant emissions can be achieved by monitoring from future satellite missions with more frequent observations.

Short summary

Short summary

We present a global dataset of atmospheric CO2 and CH4, the two most important human-made greenhouse gases, which covers almost 2 decades (2003–2020). It is produced by combining satellite data of CO2 and CH4 with a weather and air composition prediction model, and it has been carefully evaluated against independent observations to ensure validity and point out deficiencies to the user. This dataset can be used for scientific studies in the field of climate change and the global carbon cycle.

Investigation of three-dimensional radiative transfer effects for UVâVis satellite and ground-based observations of volcanic plumes

Short summary

Short summary

We investigate 3D effects of volcanic plumes on the retrieval results of satellite and ground-based UV–Vis observations. With its small ground pixels of 3.5 x 5.5 kmÂ², the TROPOMI instrument can detect much smaller volcanic plumes than previous instruments. At the same time, 3D effects become important. The effect of horizontal photon paths especially can lead to a strong underestimation of the derived plume contents of up to > 50 %, which can be further increased for strong absorbers like SO2.

Accounting for surface reflectance spectral features in TROPOMI methane retrievals

Alba Lorente, Tobias Borsdorff, Mari C. Martinez-Velarte, and Jochen Landgraf

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 1597–1608, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1597-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-1597-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

In the TROPOMI methane data, there are few false methane anomalies that can be misinterpreted as enhancements caused by strong emission sources. These artefacts are caused by features of the underlying surfaces that are not well characterized in the retrieval algorithm. Here we improve the representation of the surface reflectance dependency with wavelength in the forward model, removing the artificial localized CH4 enhancements found in several locations like Siberia, Australia and Algeria.

Short summary

Short summary

We have rigorously characterized different sources of error in satellite-based HCHO / NO2 tropospheric columns, a widely used metric for diagnosing near-surface ozone sensitivity. Specifically, the errors were categorized/quantified into (i) an inherent chemistry error, (ii) the decoupled relationship between columns and the near-surface concentration, (iii) the spatial representativeness error of ground satellite pixels, and (iv) the satellite retrieval errors.

Short summary

Short summary

We focus on the challenges associated with comparing atmospheric composition models with satellite products such as tropospheric NO2 columns. The aim is to highlight the methodological difficulties and propose sound ways of doing such comparisons. Building on the comparisons, a new satellite product is proposed and made available, which takes advantage of higher-resolution, regional atmospheric modelling to improve estimates of troposheric NO2 columns over Europe.

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 1369–1401, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1369-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-1369-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Using airborne glyoxal concentration and vertical column density measurements, vertical profiles are inferred for eight global regions in aged biomass burning plumes and the tropical marine boundary layer. Using TROPOMI observations, an analysis of space- and airborne measurements is performed. A comparison to EMAC simulations shows a general glyoxal underprediction, which points to various missing sources and precursors from anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, and the sea surface.

Short summary

Short summary

High-resolution WRF-Chem simulations are conducted over Antwerp, Belgium, in June 2019 and evaluated using meteorological data and in situ, airborne, and spaceborne NO2 measurements. An intercomparison of model, aircraft, and TROPOMI NO2 columns is conducted to characterize biases in versions 1.3.1 and 2.3.1 of the satellite product. A mass balance method is implemented to provide improved emissions for simulating NO2 distribution over the study area.

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 551–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-551-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-551-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

We developed an improved superposition column model and used the latest released (v2.3.1) TROPOMI satellite NO2 observations to estimate daily city-scale NOx and CO2 emissions. The results are verified against bottom-up emissions and OCO-2 XCO2 observations. We obtained the day-to-day variation of city NOx and CO2 emissions, allowing policymakers to gain real-time information on spatial–temporal emission patterns and the effectiveness of carbon and nitrogen regulation in urban environments.

Short summary

Short summary

Sulfur dioxide (SO2) measurements from three satellite instruments were used to update and extend the previously developed global catalogue of large SO2 emission sources. This version 2 of the global catalogue covers the period of 2005–2021 and includes a total of 759 continuously emitting point sources. The catalogue data show an approximate 50 % decline in global SO2 emissions between 2005 and 2021, although emissions were relatively stable during the last 3 years.

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 16053–16071, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-16053-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-16053-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Hydroxyl radical (OH) is the important chemical species that determines the lifetime of some greenhouse gases and trace gases. OH plays a vital role in air pollution chemistry. OH has a short lifetime and is extremely difficult to measure directly. OH concentrations derived from the chemistry transport model (CTM) have uncertainties of >50 %. Therefore, in this study, OH is derived indirectly using satellite date in urban plumes.

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 6585–6603, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6585-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6585-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) performs observations over ocean in every orbit, enhancing the monitoring capabilities of methane from space. In the sun glint geometry the mirror-like reflection at the water surface provides a signal that is high enough to retrieve methane with high accuracy and precision. We present 4 years of methane concentrations over the ocean, and we assess its quality. We also show the importance of ocean observations to quantify total CH4 emissions.

Short summary

Short summary

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) provides daily global air quality forecasts to users worldwide. One of the species of interest is carbon monoxide (CO), an important trace gas in the atmosphere with anthropogenic and natural sources, produced by incomplete combustion, for example, by wildfires. This paper looks at how well CAMS can model CO in the atmosphere and shows that the fields can be improved when blending CO data from the TROPOMI instrument with the CAMS model.

Short summary

Short summary

In this study, we have investigated the impact of 3D clouds on the tropospheric NO2 retrieval from UV–visible sensors. We applied standard NO2 retrieval methods including cloud corrections to synthetic data generated by the 3D radiative transfer model. A sensitivity study was done for synthetic data, and dependencies on various parameters were investigated. Possible mitigation strategies were investigated and compared based on 3D simulations and observed data.

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 5563–5579, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5563-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-5563-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

To retrieve tropospheric ozone column information, we subtract stratospheric column data of BASCOE from TROPOMI/S5P total ozone columns. The new S5P-BASCOE data agree well with existing tropospheric data like OMPS-MERRA-2. The data are also compared to ozone soundings. The tropospheric ozone columns show the expected temporal and spatial patterns. We will also apply the algorithm to future UV nadir missions like Sentinel 4 or 5 or to recent and ongoing missions like GOME_2 or OMI.

Short summary

We present an overview of the DISAMAR radiative transfer code, highlighting the novel semi-analytical derivatives for the doubling–adding formulae and the new DISMAS technique for weak absorbers. DISAMAR includes forward simulations and retrievals for satellite spectral measurements from 270 to 2400 nm to determine instrument specifications for passive remote sensing. It has been used in various Sentinel-4/5P/5 projects and in the TROPOMI aerosol layer height and ozone profile products.

Short summary

Short summary

Sulfur dioxide plume height after a volcanic eruption is an important piece of information for many different scientific studies and applications. Satellite UV retrievals are useful in this respect, but available algorithms have shown so far limited sensitivity to SO2 height. Here we present a new technique to improve the retrieval of SO2 plume height for SO2 columns as low as 5 DU. We demonstrate the algorithm using TROPOMI measurements and compare with other height estimates.

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4751–4765, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4751-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4751-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

AirCore is a novel balloon sampling system that can measure, among others, vertical profiles of carbon monoxide (CO) from 25–30 km of altitude to near the surface. Our analyses of AirCore and satellite CO data show that AirCore profiles are suited for satellite data validation, the use of shorter aircraft vertical profiles in satellite validation results in small errors (1–3 percent points) mostly at 300 hPa and above, and the error introduced by clouds in TROPOMI land data is small (1–2 %).

Short summary

Short summary

A total of 2 years of dual-scan ground-based MAX-DOAS measurements of tropospheric NO2 and aerosols in Uccle (Belgium) have been used to develop a new optimal-estimation-based inversion approach to retrieve horizontal profiles of surface NO2 concentration and aerosol extinction profiles. We show that the combination of an appropriate sampling of TROPOMI pixels by ground-based measurements and an adequate a priori NO2 profile shape in TROPOMI retrievals improves the agreement between datasets.

Short summary

Short summary

We present a computationally very efficient method for the synergetic use of level 2 remote-sensing data products. We apply the method to IASI vertical profile and TROPOMI total column space-borne methane observations and thus gain sensitivity for the tropospheric methane partial columns, which is not achievable by the individual use of TROPOMI and IASI. These synergetic effects are evaluated theoretically and empirically by inter-comparisons to independent references of TCCON, AirCore, and GAW.

On the influence of underlying elevation data on Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOMI satellite methane retrievals over Greenland

Jonas Hachmeister, Oliver Schneising, Michael Buchwitz, Alba Lorente, Tobias Borsdorff, John P. Burrows, Justus Notholt, and Matthias Buschmann

Atmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 4063–4074, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4063-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-4063-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

Sentinel-5P trace gas retrievals rely on elevation data in their calculations. Outdated or inaccurate data can lead to significant errors in e.g. dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4). We show that the use of inadequate elevation data leads to strong XCH4 anomalies in Greenland. Similar problems can be expected for other regions with inaccurate elevation data. However, we expect these to be more localized. We show that updating elevation data used in the retrieval solves this issue.

Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) collection 4: establishing a 17-year-long series of detrended level-1b data
