Books

The Ward by John Lorinc, Michael McClelland, Ellen Scheinberg, Tatum Taylor

“From the 1870s to the 1950s, waves of immigrants to Toronto Irish, Jewish, Chinese and Italian, among others landed in The Ward in the centre of downtown. Deemed a slum, the area was crammed with derelict housing and ethnic businesses; it was razed in the 1950s to make way for a grand civic plaza and modern city hall. Archival photos and contributions from a wide variety of voices finally tell the story of this complex neighborhood and the lessons it offers about immigration and poverty in big cities. Contributors include historians, politicians, architects and descendants of Ward residents on subjects such as playgrounds, tuberculosis, bootlegging and Chinese laundries. ”

The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman

“Anyone who designs anything to be used by humans — from physical objects to computer programs to conceptual tools — must read this book, and it is an equally tremendous read for anyone who has to use anything created by another human. It could forever change how you experience and interact with your physical surroundings, open your eyes to the perversity of bad design and the desirability of good design, and raise your expectations about how things should be designed.”

The Pruitt-Igoe Myth directed by Chad Freidrichs

“Destroyed in a dramatic and highly-publicized implosion, the Pruitt-Igoe public housing complex has become a widespread symbol of failure amongst architects, politicians and policy makers. The Pruitt-Igoe Myth explores the social, economic and legislative issues that led to the decline of conventional public housing in America, and the city centers in which they resided, while tracing the personal and poignant narratives of several of the project’s residents. In the post-War years, the American city changed in ways that made it unrecognizable from a generation earlier, privileging some and leaving others in its wake. The next time the city changes, remember Pruitt-Igoe.”

Brazil directed by Terry Gilliam

“Low-level bureaucrat Sam Lowry escapes the monotony of his day-to-day life through a recurring daydream of himself as a virtuous hero saving a beautiful damsel. Investigating a case that led to the wrongful arrest and eventual death of an innocent man instead of wanted terrorist Harry Tuttle, he meets the woman from his daydream, and in trying to help her gets caught in a web of mistaken identities, mindless bureaucracy and lies.”
