Thomas Lane was born circa 1662, the son of Thomas Lane and Elizabeth (Unknown) Lane. It is assumed he was born in Surry, Virginia, where Thomas and Elizabeth lived. According to the Surry County Tithables of 1678, both Thomas Lane Sr and Jr are listed. This helps for confirm that Thomas Jr was at least 16, the age of accounting.
