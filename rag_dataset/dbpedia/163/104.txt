In films, it is often heard as part of a dance sequence, or possibly from a car radio on-the-road setting, or home sound system when the characters choose music to set an ambience or illustrate their own personal style. Recently it appears in the form of the "lone runner in the street listening to earbud " music as a popular meme or trope, when the the director or writer are struggling to find a good way to introduce another action figure.

Source Music means musical works (and accompanying literary works) and sound recordings not specifically composed or created for use in the Film and incorporated into the soundtrack of the Film;

"Occasional music" is the standard term I've seen used academically for such music, even though it primarily refers to music composed for the purpose of the film.

The abbreviation "OST" for "original soundtrack" can include both true "occasional music" and bonus music inspired by the movies that isn't played at all until the credits, and other music that does not accompany the action (e.g. music in the opening and closing sequences of an anime).
