Among the several good decisions made by the Warners in the 1920s - to employ Daryl F. Zanuck, to recruit Rin Tin Tin in some enduring action adventures, and to get the sound revolution started - a less fanfared decision was to bring then 40 year old director Michael Curtiz over from Hungary. However he was an acquisition that boosted the Warners' fortunes for decades.

Curtiz had a real talent for lighting and the camera, and apparently was just crazy about dissolves, but the New York Times review said that he used them wisely and well. This film in particular involves a circus, a murder, and the titular "third degree" that a murder suspect is given where the police are trying to sweat out a confession. Delores Costello was the featured player here - and she got good reviews but remember WB did not have a big budget for big stars at this point in their history.

Also note that WB continued to put musical numbers as preludes to their film to show off their Vitaphone sound system. Here Paul Whiteman and his orchestra as well as Frank McGlynn reciting the Gettysburg address were featured, hopefully not at the same time.

Nothing is more fun than watching Warner Brothers grow up.
