Canonical announced today that the first Ubuntu phone, made in partnership with BQ, called Aquaris E4.5 Ubuntu Edition, will go on sale in Europe starting next week on BQ.com, through a series of "flash sales", and it will cost 169.90 Euros (~ $193 / Â£127).

Aquaris E4.5 is a completely unlocked dual micro-SIM phone which comes with a 4.5 inch, 540x960 resolution display, a 1.3 GHz MediaTek Quad Core Cortex A7 CPU, 1GB of RAM, 8GB internal memory, an 8 Mpx rear camera and a 5 Mpx front camera. For the complete Aquaris E4.5 specs, see THIS page.

It's important to mention that the phone targets early adopters and if you just want WhatsApp or Skype, Ubuntu phone isn't for you just yet, as these services won't be available at launch.

The exact date, time and URL of the flash sales will be announced on the Ubuntu and BQ Twitter accounts as well as the Ubuntu Facebook and Google+ pages next week, so keep an eye on them if you want to be among the first to get an Ubuntu phone.
