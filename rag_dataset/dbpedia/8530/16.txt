Born in the German town of Eisleben in 1483, Luther enrolled at the University of Erfurt in 1501. Against his father’s wishes, he ended his study of law there in order to become a monk in the Order of Saint Augustine and was soon thereafter ordained a priest. In 1508, he enrolled at the University of Wittenberg, and joined the faculty four years later as professor of theology. Around 1514 he also became a preacher in the Wittenberg parish church.

Notoriety came to Luther initially by way of controversy. Provoked in 1517 by the sale of indulgences—authorized by the pope most recently in several German territories, ostensibly to support the massive rebuilding of Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome—Luther drew up a list of ninety-five theses objecting to the practice. Hoping to provoke academic debate, he circulated his objections to colleagues and Church superiors. Quickly printed and circulated in Latin and German, the Ninety-five Theses were followed by Luther’s Sermon on Indulgence and Grace, a German commentary that reached an even larger audience, going through more than twenty editions within two years. The wide circulation of these texts, and the Church’s responses to them, projected Luther onto an international stage and drew him into direct and public opposition to the papacy. As he and his allies clarified their theological positions, presses throughout Germany published hundreds of tracts in large numbers; these included portraits, as a means of granting authority to both the author and his texts. These portraits helped to shape and control Luther’s growing reputation as a powerful politician and thoughtful academic.
