Parents need to know that 1922 is based on a novella by Stephen King and is a violent, gory tale of murder and insanity. Set in the year 1922 on a farm in Nebraska, intense conflict within a family leads to its destruction. Shot with every intent of shocking and disturbing its audience, the film basks in the macabre, including (spoiler alert) an abundance of rats -- climbing in and over corpses, coming through walls, marching together as a vicious army. Expect plenty of blood and horrific visuals of the undead as well as the dying. Guns and knives wreak havoc on the innocent and on the guilty. Some cursing ("goddammit," "Christ") is heard, along with a mother's coarse cautionary words to her 14-year-old son about not engaging in sexual intercourse (i.e., "keep your willy in your pants"). Central characters drink heavily, which leads to drunkenness in multiple instances. Lead character smokes a pipe. Stephen King's work seems a never-ending source of movie and TV material. Some stories, like The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me, emphasize the drama rather than the horror. This movie merits a place among his grisly best. No kids.
