Boim chapel, Lviv

Lviv (Ukrainian: Львів, German: Lemberg; Polish: Lwów; Russian: Львов, Hungarian: Lemberg or Ilyvó) is a western Ukranian city.

The city was founded by King Danylo of the Ruthenian duchy of Halych-Volhynia, and it was named in honor of his son, Lev (Lion). It was an important city of Poland (and later Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth) and also the capital of the Ruthenian Voivodeship.

After the First Partition of Poland (1772) Lemberg became the capital of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. After the collapse of the Habsburg Empire the city became Polish again; it was part of the Second Polish Republic and was the second Polish city between the word wars. After the WWII it was part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (within the Soviet Union).

The political and commercial role of Lviv attracted different ethnic groups with different cultural and religious traditions. When the first university was opened (1784), the lectures were held in Latin, German, Polish and Ukrainian. The city also had a huge Jewish population.

The Böhm family, of Hungarian ancestry, arrived in the city in the late 16th century. They built this small late Renassaince chapel in the old cemetery between 1609-1617. The reliefs of the facade depict scenes from the Gospels.
