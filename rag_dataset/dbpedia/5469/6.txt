Come join HacDC for a viewing of Freedom Downtime, the documentary film made by Emmanuel Goldstein and 2600 Films about Kevin Mitnick.

This film is in direct response to the Miramax film Takedown, where the filmmakers feel that Kevin Mitnick and the hacker community are misrepresented. In this film, the filmakers search out the makers of that film a la Roger & Me as well as interview famous members of the hacker community.

When: Friday, May 22nd 8pm

Where: HacDC Main Space

This event is Free and Open to the Public!
