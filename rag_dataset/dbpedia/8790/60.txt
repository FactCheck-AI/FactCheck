Facts about Bratislava

Bratislava, relatively to Slovakia, lays in the western part of the country, very near to the borders with Austria and Hungary. It is the only one European capital city, which borders with two other countries.

Thanks to its position, it is not unusual to live in a small Austrian village and commute for work to Bratislava and vice versa. Bratislava is also very close to Vienna - the capital city of Austria. Thanks to the short 60km distance, these two cities are the closest two capitals in Europe. That is why there are strong connections between these two old cities and also traveling from Bratislava to Vienna is very easy - there are trains, buses, or even boat links on a regular basis.

Together with Hungarian capital - Budapest, and Czech capital - Prague, this "fantastic four" forms an important Central-European metropolitan region.

Bratislava is very often called like a "A Beauty on Danube", because it spreads along both sides of this river. Even though it is placed mostly on the flat surface, the mountains Little Carpathians, begin right behind the city. These mountains are popular place for the weekend relax or short walks in the nature.
