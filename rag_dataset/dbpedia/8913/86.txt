Pamela Rose is a San Francisco jazz and blues vocalist who has thrilled audiences locally and internationally with her swinging, soulful style. Rose is that rare breed of entertainer who connects solidly with her audience by always delivering a personal and unforgettable musical experience. Her rich, warm voice and easy rapport with excellent musicians moves jazz and blues audiences of all ages.

With the dazzling array of tunes on her fifth album Wild Women of Song-all by women songwriters-the veteran San Francisco jazz and blues vocalist Pamela Rose makes a compelling case for the enduring contributions of women to America's treasure trove of popular music. The new CD's sly, affectionate subtitle, Great Gal Composers of the Jazz Era, describes Rose's musical mission in no uncertain terms.

Boasting a rich, bold voice and blues-infused sensibility, Pamela Rose brings vast musical experience to an emotionally dynamic program of 15 songs by 14 women. Working with Grammy Award-winning producer Leslie Ann Jones, a studio legend who has crafted classic albums by vocal masters such as Rosemary Clooney, Dianne Reeves, Dee Dee Bridgewater, and Carmen McRae, Rose emerges as a major-league talent with an uncanny gift for putting a personal stamp on familiar standards, sturdy blues, and obscure ballads from the American Songbook's back pages.
