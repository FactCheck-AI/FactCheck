PITTSBURGH, Pa. – Former NFL linebacker Clark Haggans, who won Super Bowl 40 with the Pittsburgh Steelers, has died at age 46, a team spokesman confirmed Wednesday.

Haggans played 13 seasons in the NFL from 2000-2012 after being drafted out of Colorado State University by the Steelers in the fifth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

He was a key member of the Steelers’ defense during the team’s Super Bowl-winning season in 2006, when Pittsburgh defeated the Seattle Seahawks 21-10 to win Super Bowl XL. He recorded five tackles and one sack in the game.

After spending eight seasons with the Steelers from 2000-2007, he played four seasons with the Arizona Cardinals and one with the San Francisco 49ers before retiring after the 2012 season. He finished his NFL career with 520 tackles, 46.5 sacks, 16 forced fumbles, five fumbles recovered, and one interception in 172 games played, including 104 starts.
