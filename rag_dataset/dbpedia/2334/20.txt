18 october 1807 – 30 april 1814

Comments

The Peninsular War starts on 18th of october 1807 with Junot and his French troops crossing the border to Spain (With the intention of crossing Spain and to invade Portugal in November 1807) and ends with the Treaty of Paris on 30th April 1814

The Guerilla War of Spain starts on May 2, 1808, when rioting sweeps through Madrid, called Dos de Mayo.

Napoleon got in direct command of the troops in Spain on November 8,1808.

Towards the end of the campaign Britain, Portugal and Spain are regarded as “Allies”. But this is not indicated in this list (so far).

Napoleon’s First Abdication was on 6th April 1814.

Comments

According to Oman’s “History of the Peninsular War” this event can also be regarded as an British victory. Some sources claim an British victory some claim a french victory.

The objective of Britain was to evacuate the site defeated. And they succeeded in doing so. Here in this list France is mentioned as victor because it occupied the place at the end.

In February 1998 there was quite a dispute in the discussion forum about who’s victory this was (most voted for France). If you’d like you can obtain a review/summary of these threads at liechty@access.ch.

Death of Moore.
