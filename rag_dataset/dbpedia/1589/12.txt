Key Agile Development Concepts

The key concepts of Agile development and Agile software development are:Â

AdaptabilityÂ

The changing demands and development process require adaptability in the project. It helps the team and project get back on track, increases the teamâs confidence, saves time, and decreases productivity due to mess. It also allows changing the path of development and deployment to deliver the results timely.Â

DisruptionÂ

Agile methodology encourages changes to deliver quality results and improve customer satisfaction. It includes changing priorities, culture, and goals. Though the changes are hard and unacceptable, management on collective agreement becomes easier while providing better results.Â

CollaborationÂ

It is another valued key Agile concept that contributes to building trust and accountability. It helps bring different ideas and collective discussion to improve poor but potentially holding ideas.Â

Iterative DevelopmentsÂ

Rework for improvements is a common thing in software development. The iterative process here follows a continuous and close feedback loop for improvement. It is the core concept in Agile development.Â

Incremental DevelopmentÂ

It involves creating a basic version of software with all the required features. Further improvements are made as decided during the meetups or calls. The increments to the software are made to the modules, along with the addition of user-friendly features.Â

Milestone ChecksÂ

It is aimed at client and team improvement and development. Here, the teams analyze the previous developments after reaching a specific and significant part of the project.Â

Jira

The tool eases the planning of software projects such as Agile and sprint planning. It also contributes to responsive and transparent collaboration. Project managers and developers generally use Jira for task distribution, story tracking, and development tasks. Additionally, Jira also provides real-time updates on release details and improves the team performance.Â

DockerÂ

The docker platform is widely used to set up and manage the containers required to meet the need for flexibility and application deployment on a certain host. The platform delivers the containers through virtualization at the Operating System. The containers comprise different components such as configuration files, software, and libraries, thus meeting the needs. Docker also helps to communicate between containers. Moreover, it holds more benefits than traditional virtual machines.Â

Kubernetes

The tool is used to effortlessly solve the problem of handling multiple containers. It is an open-source platform that supports scaling and automated application deployment. It also manages container applications, containerized workloads, and automation of container deployments, and it supports declarative configuration. Kubernetes is used for its ability to automate the deployment and scaling processes of complex containerized applications.Â

JenkinsÂ

It is another open-source automation that is free to use for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) tasks. The software development teams use it to build, test, deployment of CI/CD tasks. It offers effective integration options and automates the CI/CD environment.Â

SlackÂ

Slack is a popular tool in Agile software development, most commonly used in business communications, and it is effective for collaboration. It is considered better than emails for team members as it provides an opportunity for natural collaboration. Here, two types of communication are possible: direct messaging and conventional IRC or Internet Relay Chat. The IRC includes functionalities such as private groups and topic-specific chat rooms or channels. Moreover, the conversations are also divided into public and private channels along with direct messages. It eliminates the one-to-one or group chats and introduces thread-based chats, which are easier to follow.Â

Advantages of Agile Software Development

The incorporation of Agile development in software engineering has the following advantages:Â

People and interactions are preferred over tools and processes in the usage of Agile software development methodology.
