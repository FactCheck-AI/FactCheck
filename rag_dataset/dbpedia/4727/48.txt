Spanish consumer electronics company BQ have released their Ubuntu Aquaris phone in Europe via their official online store.

Fans of Linux or just those of us who want to try something new might be interested in giving the Ubuntu powered BQ Aquaris E4.5 a spin. The Aquaris E4.5 is the first Ubuntu Edition phone to go on sale, but being an early adopter comes at a cost.

Specifications of the Linux powered phone donât really rival those of similar priced Android phones from China. For example the hardware on the BQ includes a 4.5-inch qHD display, quad-core MT6582 processor, 1GB RAM, 8 mega-pixel main camera and no LTE. For only slightly more, the JiaYu S3 could be had with larger 5.5-inch FHD display, 2GB RAM, LTE and 64bit MT6752 chipset.

Still running Ubuntu on a phone is a novel idea and fans of the desktop version of the system are surely going to want to give the mobile OS a try.

The BQ Aquaris E4.5 is only available in Europe at the moment through the official online store.
