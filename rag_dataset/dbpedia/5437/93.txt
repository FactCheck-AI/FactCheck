Personal Statement

Hello, my name is Leo Benvenuti and I'm Italian/American that lives in Sardegna, Italy with my family. Â Calico (aka) Soccer has been in my system since I was born in 2006 on the day the world championship game Italy VS Checz Repulic was playing. In Italy we start playing as soon as we can sit-up. Today, I play for Porto Rotondo in Sardegna, Italy. I usually play left wing but, I can also play right wing and offensive midfielder as well. Â These past years I have been hard but I gave 100% to the game. I pushed myself to perform better and improve myself. The dedication I have to the game paid off because last season (2022/2023) we won the championship! At the end of the season I had made 16 goals and 18 assists. I want to keep giving more than 100% to the game. I'm ready and Â It's time for me to move on to University/collage level. I will make a difference for any University/collage because I will dedicate myself to the school and to my teammates so we can be the best.
