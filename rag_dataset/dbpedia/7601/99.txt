An ethereal styling piece inspired by 70's fashion, the Festival Express Short Gathered Layer With Draped Shoulder is for those with hypnotic hearts that wear on their sleeves. Mused by the unapologetic Janis Joplin, this navy and animal print silk layer is enriched with CAMILLA crystal embellishments, billowing batwing sleeve and finished off with a chic gathered shoulder seam. We love to layer this piece with matching Festival Express silhouettes for an opulent boho look.
