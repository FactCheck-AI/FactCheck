Funabashi Shin-Keisei Bus has started operating a wrapping bus designed with Funabashi’s unofficial mascot character ‘Funassyi’ called ‘Funassyi-go’ from November 17 and will continue until around November 2025.

The initiative celebrates the 20th anniversary of Funabashi Shin-Keisei Bus. The design features ‘Funassyi’ along with the image of Funabashi and Narashino areas. The routes operated include the Maebara line, Miyama line, Tsudanuma Green Heights line, Shibayama line, and Toyomi line, all managed by the Narashino office.

On the day of operation, the location of the vehicle can be tracked by searching for ‘Narashino office 2741’ on ‘Bus-Vision,’ which gives location information.
