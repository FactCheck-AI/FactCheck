So I guess some Russian guys decided to turn an fps into a movie and this is the result. They have an indiegogo campaign which I will not link to (because of the language and I didn't want this to seem like a shill post) but is easily found via Google or the video below.

Anyway apparently Timur Bekmambetov offered to produce this for the filmmakers after he saw a similar music video they made.

I've wanted to see something like this even since the intro to Strange Days. I think it looks pretty badass (although 90 minutes of it is probably going to be exhausting).

Plus what other movie features Sharlto Copley as your sidekick?

HARDCORE is a modern, action Sci-Fi story about HENRY, a newly resurrected cyborg who must save his wife/creator ESTELLE (Haley Bennet) from the clutches of a psychotic tyrant with telekinetic powers, AKAN (Danila Kozlovsky), and his army of mercenaries. Fighting alongside Henry is JIMMY (Sharlto Copley), who is Henry's only hope to make it through the day. Hardcore takes place over the course of one day, in Moscow, Russiaâ€‹
