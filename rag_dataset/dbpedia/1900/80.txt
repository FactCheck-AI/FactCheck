Two of BTS’s Japanese songs — “Film Out” and “Lights” — were certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ), according to Big Hit Music on Thursday.

“Film Out” was the lead track of Japanese album “The Best” released in June 2021, and “Lights” was released in July 2021.

Japanese version of the single “Spring Day” (2017) was also certified gold.

The RIAJ certifies music based on sales including hardcopy CD purchases and online downloads. Singles, EPs or albums earn gold certification for more than 100,000 copies sold, platinum for 250,000, double platinum for 500,000 and triple platinum for 750,000. Over 1 million copies sold earns a million certification.

The band’s two other English singles “Butter” (2021) and “Permission To Dance” (2021) were also certified platinum. For “Butter,” it became the fastest song to achieve the certification in merely 72 days since its release.

With the latest additions, the band now has a total of eight songs which have been certified platinum, including “Dynamite” (2020), “Boy With Luv” (2019), “Stay Gold” (2020) and “DNA” (2017).
