Full of playful twists and sexy turns, RED ROCK WEST is a perfectly plotted game of cat and mouse that will keep you guessing until the final shocking shot.

Dead tired and flat broke after driving 1,200 miles, Michael (Nicolas Cage, Face/Off), an unemployed Texan, walks into a tavern in tiny Red Rock, Wyoming and is immediately offered a job. There's just one problem: the owner thinks Michael is a hit man and the "job" is murdering the owner''s wife (Lara Flynn Boyle, Twin Peaks). Just when Michael decides to take the money and run, the real hit-man (Dennis Hopper, Easy Rider) arrives, ready to do the job right.
