Topeka, Kansas

THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN is a heavy rock band out of Topeka, Kansas Boasting a gargantuan sound that has been described as "ZZ Top trampled by mammoths" and "like the great depression era blues shouter Blind Willie Johnson, if he had fronted the '60s San Francisco band Blue Cheer at their sludgiest," THE MIDNIGHT GHOST TRAIN's epic live shows are "intense and real" and an uplifting cure-all for fans or critics that may feel rock music has lost its "edge". The trio has also averaged over 300 live shows per year since its formation in 2007.
