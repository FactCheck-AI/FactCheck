The circular, red-brick tower was built in 1806 as part of a line of Martello towers built to form a coastal defence during the Napoleonic Wars. It was Martello Tower No 62. The tower had a concrete pillbox added to the roof during the Second World War. The tower is now used as housing after renovation work was completed.
