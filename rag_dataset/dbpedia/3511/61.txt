IMPETUS - SYNOPSIS

Jennifer Alleyn | fiction / documentary | Fr. + En., sub. Fr. | 94 minutes

In the process of her ongoing film shoot in New York City, a filmmaker finds herself questioning the origin of impulsion. As she tries to overcome loss through creation, an unexpected event enlightens her journey. A search for movement beneath inertia. Art in real life. Music as a cure. A craving for unbounded cinema.

With Emmanuel Schwartz and Pascale Bussières, J. Reissner and Esfir Dyachkov.
