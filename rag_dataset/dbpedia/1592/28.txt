Popular Portuguese Cheeses

Portugal boasts a diverse array of cheeses, each with unique characteristics derived from different regions, milk types, and production methods. Here are some of the most beloved Portuguese cheeses:

Queijo da Serra da Estrela

Arguably the most famous Portuguese cheese, Queijo da Serra da Estrela hails from the mountainous Serra da Estrela region. Made from raw sheep’s milk, it has a creamy, almost spreadable interior and a strong, buttery flavor. The cheese is traditionally coagulated using thistle flower, which gives it a distinctive taste. When trying this cheese, listen for locals referring to it as “Queijo da Serra” or simply “Serra.”

Queijo de Azeitão

This cheese is produced in the Azeitão region near Lisbon, using raw sheep’s milk. Queijo de Azeitão is known for its soft, creamy texture and tangy, slightly spicy flavor. Like Queijo da Serra da Estrela, it is coagulated with thistle flower. Its small, cylindrical shape makes it easily recognizable.

Queijo de São Jorge

From the Azores archipelago, specifically the island of São Jorge, comes Queijo de São Jorge. This cow’s milk cheese has a firm texture and a sharp, tangy flavor, often compared to cheddar. It’s aged for several months, which allows its flavor to develop and intensify. The cheese is typically available in large wheels, and locals often refer to it simply as “São Jorge.”

Queijo de Nisa

Originating from the Alentejo region, Queijo de Nisa is a sheep’s milk cheese with a semi-hard texture and a slightly tangy, nutty flavor. It is produced using a traditional method that involves hand-molding the curds. The cheese is usually aged for a few months, resulting in a firm, yet creamy texture.

Requeijão

Requeijão is a fresh cheese made from whey, similar to ricotta. It has a soft, creamy texture and a mild, slightly sweet flavor. It’s often used in desserts, such as the traditional Portuguese sweet “requeijão com doce de abóbora” (requeijão with pumpkin jam), or spread on bread as a snack.

Cheese Tasting Tips

To fully appreciate Portuguese cheeses, follow these tips for a successful tasting experience:

Start with Mild Flavors

Begin your tasting with milder cheeses and gradually progress to stronger, more pungent varieties. This allows your palate to adjust and fully appreciate the nuances of each cheese.

Observe the Cheese

Take a moment to look at the cheese. Note its color, texture, and any unique features. This visual inspection can give you clues about its flavor and texture.

Smell the Cheese

A cheese’s aroma can reveal a lot about its flavor. Gently inhale the scent of the cheese to pick up on its aromatic notes. Is it earthy, tangy, or nutty?

Taste and Savor

Take a small piece of cheese and let it sit on your tongue for a moment before chewing. Pay attention to the initial flavors and how they evolve as you chew. Notice the texture and how it feels in your mouth.

Pair with Accompaniments

Cheese can be enjoyed on its own, but pairing it with accompaniments can enhance the experience. Try pairing Portuguese cheeses with local wines, breads, fruits, or jams. For example, Queijo da Serra da Estrela pairs wonderfully with a robust red wine, while Requeijão is delicious with honey or sweet preserves.
