Egil Skallagrimsson was one of the greatest Viking heroes. A poet at three and a killer at seven, he was a man who drank prodigiously and wielded his battleaxe with fearful force. Egil was big and brave, an adventurous traveller who must have seemed immortal. For despite his enemies’ efforts, he lived to be 80. We know this because an Old Norse saga is devoted to his exploits. Egil’s Saga also describes a man with outsized bones, a huge misshapen skull and a motley collection of health problems that suggest something was seriously amiss. A thousand years on, Egil’s Saga is more than a tale of high adventure&colon; it’s also a medical mystery.

NO ONE who met Egil Skallagrimsson could forget him – if they survived the encounter. Born in Iceland in AD 910, Egil’s life was so long and full of adventures that he was guaranteed a place in the Old Norse sagas. According to the stories, Egil made voyages to England, Germany and the Baltic as well as Scandinavia, took part in Viking raids and fought great battles. To his enemies, he was a dangerous man intent on bashing in their brains with his battleaxe. To his friends, he was a farmer and a poet who fought only to stamp out injustice.
