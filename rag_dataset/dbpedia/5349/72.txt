Egil is a dwarf that works at the Artisans' Workshop in Falador and runs the Artisans' Workshop Reward Shop.

Egil has an identical twin cousin named Lige Tonweight, who may appear whenever a player finishes smithing any item in the workshop to give out a ceremonial sword design.

Players who have finished working on their ceremonial swords may turn in the plans to Egil manually to receive the experience for it.
