She's played the vivacious Haley Dunphy on the hit series Modern Family for eight years.

And now Sarah Hyland has revealed her character is bisexual.

The actress, 26, confirmed the news after a fan asked her about her character's sexuality on Twitter on Wednesday.

'I don't know what the writers would say? But I confirm,' Sarah tweeted in response.

Haley has not yet been romantically involved with another female character on the show.

Sarah's character has dated a number of men on the show, with two of her more notable relationships being with her on-off boyfriend Dylan (Reid Ewing) and Andy (Adam Devine).

Fans immediately started praising Sarah for confirming the news, and also for her character's sexuality.

'YOU ROCK!' Twitter user @rafalira99 replied.

'This made me tear up a lil thank you love (heart emojis)', @Kyrahjustyce told the actress.

In real life, Sarah has recently been linked to Bachelor In Paradise star Wells Adams.

The actress previously was in a long-term relationship with Dominic Sherwood.

Season nine of Modern Family is currently airing on ABC.
