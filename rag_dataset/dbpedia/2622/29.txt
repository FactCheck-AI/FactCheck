"I long for a better world. And, as best I can, I intend to be part of the answer rather than part of the problem"

You gotta admire the guys courage...

I have just finished reading the late John Smith’s autobiography “John Smith On The Side of The Angels” for the first time. Written in 1987 this is great read which I believe has a message that is still relevant today more than ever. John Smith was one of many people that helped shape my own desire to get into Social Work and help people. I can’t believe it has taken me so long to read such a great autobiography.
