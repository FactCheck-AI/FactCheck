Day of the deadmau5 tour!

With his iconic mouse mask, deadmau5 (real name Joel Zimmerman) has been a key figure in the EDM revolution of the past decade. A purveyor of immersive, heart-pounding electronica that now sees him headlining music festivals worldwide, he has six Grammy Award nominations to his name. This year will see him head on the brand new tour, 'Day of the deadmau5'. Don't miss your chance to see him live!

DID YOU KNOW?

The name deadmau5 originates from an incident where a mouse crawled into his computer and died. He then posted on an internet forum of his shenanigans, and the members began calling him TheDeadMouseGuy. Dead Mouse was too long for an IRC login name, so he abbreviated it to 'deadmau5'.
