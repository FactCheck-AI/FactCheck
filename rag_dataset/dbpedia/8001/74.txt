A mouse forms Deadmau5. The name Deadmau5 (pronounced dead mouse) comes from an incident where a mouse crawled into Joel Zimmerman's computer.

Dead mouse was too long for a site login name so he abbreviated it to be "Deadmau5"

How do you get deadmau5 on woozworld?

you could hack people with deadmau5 but that would be unfair for the person who bought it, what i would do to find deadmau5 is to go to facebook and find people who are selling accounts with deadmau5 -there is a girl out there that has about 10 deadmau5 accounts, sadly i forgot her name on facebook) well i hope this was helpful! :3
