Covertext Filmmaker, theatre producer, author, cartoonist, actor and scholar of psychomagic, Alejandro Jodorowsky is one of the most interesting and multifaceted figures of our time. This boxed set includes two painstakingly restored masterpieces: the spiritual 'El Topo' and the delirious 'The Holy Mountain', works which marked an epoch and are now considered the greatest expression of the visionary talent of the Chilean director. In addition, for the first time in DVD, this collection also includes Jodorowsky's debut feature film, 'Fando y Lis' (reprinted and restored directly from the negative), a work based on the great director's memories of a play by Fernando Arrabal. Among the other materials included in this boxed set is 'La Cravate', a short made by Jodorowsky at the end of the 1950s. Believed lost for many years, the film offers a foretaste of the anarchic-surrealist style which was to characterize the whole of Jodorowsky's future film career. A unique boxed set of Jodorowsky's most important films including the legendary El Topo, its unforgettable successor, The Holy Mountain, the bizarre fable of corrupted innocence, Fando and Lis, and the recently rediscovered Severed Heads [La Cravate] as well as the 1994 film-documentary The Jodorowsky Constellation. All the films are uncut and have been digitally-restored.
