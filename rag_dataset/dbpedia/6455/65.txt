It's a relief to see that Disney can still conjure up a princess movie to rival its all-time greats. In 2009 there was the lovely, hopeful Tiana in The Princess and the Frog, and now there's another fairy tale heroine who's worthy of adoration: Tangled's Rapunzel. She's guileless, strong, and beautiful -- and so breathtakingly good that you can't help but weep with her when she thinks all hope is lost. And her chemistry with Flynn is so heart-flutteringly good that you don't even need to use the kids as an excuse to watch: This is a perfect date-night pick. Their relationship is built on mutual respect and trust, something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies. And it's Flynn who nearly dies and requires Rapunzel to save him, not the other way around! What a refreshing turn on the age-old damsel-in-distress meets dashing-prince story.

As for the dramatic tension, it's best in the form of Mother Gothel -- brilliantly played by Murphy, whose signature Broadway voice (on fabulous display in the amazing number "Mother Knows Best") adds the necessary punch to Moore's sweet, airy vocals. Mother is, at least as princess film villains go, a personal favorite. In a youth-obsessed culture, who couldn't extend the tiniest bit of sympathy for an ancient, shriveled old hag who'd rather look like a young Sophia Loren-meets-Cher? Composer Alan Menken's songs -- from Murphy's show-stopper to Moore's eternally optimistic "When Will My Life Begin," the inspiring "I've Got a Dream," and the love song "I See the Light" -- are all great, as is singer-songwriter Grace Potter's theme, "Something I Want." Tangled has it all -- lovable characters, fantastic songs, and a powerful message about how your life can change if other people believe in you and your dreams.
