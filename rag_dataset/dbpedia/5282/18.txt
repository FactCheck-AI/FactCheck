Character actor William G. “Bill” Nunn, III ‘76 was best known for his acclaimed turn as Radio Raheem in Spike Lee‘s groundbreaking 1989 film Do The Right Thing, as well as for playing Daily Bugle editor Robbie Robertson in the Sam Raimi-directed Spider-Man trilogy.

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1953, Nunn was a 1976 graduate of Morehouse College, who came to acting relatively late. His first acting job was in fellow Morehouse alum Spike Lee’s second film, School Daze, based on Lee’s own experience at the college.

Nunn was subsequently cast in his most famous role, Radio Raheem in Do the Right Thing, the film’s iconic supporting character known for blasting the music of Public Enemy from his boom box wherever he goes. Notably, Raheem is killed in an act of police negligence and brutality amid the film’s chaotic depiction of racial tensions in Brooklyn. The film, especially Nunn’s performance, has continued to resonate culturally and in recent years has received renewed attention in light of the Black Lives Matter movement.

Following Right Thing, Nunn went on to appear more than 40 films and several TV shows, among them New Jack City, Regarding Henry, Sister Act, Money Train, Idlewild, and of course Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy.
