Will Sharpe (The White Lotus) has landed the title role of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in a Sky television adaptation of “Amadeus.” Last I checked, Mozart wasn’t Japanese …

Miloš Forman’s 1984 film, “Amadeus,” which itself was an adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s 1979 play of the same name, won eight Oscars, including Best Picture and did not need a remake, television or otherwise — it’s a perfect movie.

The film recounted the life, success and troubles of Mozart (Tom Hulce), as told by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a composer and rival, who was deeply jealous of Mozart's talent and claimed to have murdered him.

Sharpe — who is fantastic in Jesse Eisenberg’s upcoming “A Real Pain” — will reunite with “Giri/Haji” writer and producer Joe Barton. Sky describes the series as “fresh, intimate,” and “irreverent” … This entire project just sounds misbegotten and the cameras haven’t even rolled yet on it.
