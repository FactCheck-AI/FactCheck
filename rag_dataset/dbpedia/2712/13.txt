Logging's heyday, from the 1860s through the 1920s, is on display in one of Oregon's most unusual stops: the Collier Logging Museum in woodsy Collier Memorial State Park in Klamath County.

Nestled at the confluence of Spring Creek and the Williamson River, the open-air collection of logging equipment is nothing short of mind-boggling. More than 70 pieces of heavy equipment, some that look like they come from a medieval torture chamber, are scattered around the scenic grounds.

The museum dates to 1947 when brothers Alfred and Andrew Collier of Klamath Falls donated 146 acres and a collection of antique logging equipment to the state.

Displays show the evolution of logging, from donkey engines to yarders and gang saws. Signs help visitors weave their way past displays, including a slice of the largest Douglas fir ever cut in Oregon. Columbus hadn't set sail from Spain when this tree was a youngster. In the summer through Labor Day, movies about old-time logging and other topics are shown at 9 p.m. every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
