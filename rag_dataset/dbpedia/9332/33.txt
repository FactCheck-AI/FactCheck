The currency of Afghanistan, Afghani, has emerged as the world's best-performing currency of the September quarter so far.

News portals said the massive dollar inflow in the form of humanitarian aid and the currency control measures imposed by the ruling Taliban propelled the country to gain the achievement.

Afghanistanâ€™s currency was trading at around 78.25 against the US dollar on September 26, recording a 9 per cent gain.

Afghani outperformed Colombian peso which recorded a 3 per cent gain during the same period.

The Afghani has emerged as the third strongest performer after Colombia and Sri Lanka's currencies with a 14 per cent gain year-on-year basis.

The ruling Taliban, which seized power two years ago, banned the use of US dollars and Pakistani rupees in local transactions, aiming to solidify Afghani's role as the primary currency.

The country also experienced a substantial influx of humanitarian aid, providing a much-needed boost to its economy.
