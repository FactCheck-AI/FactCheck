The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has a new television home. The 2023 ceremony, which has aired on HBO since 1995, is moving to Disney+ and ABC as part of a new deal.

It will broadcast live coast-to-coast on Disney+ on Friday, November 3. Disney-owned linear network ABC will air a special with performances on January 1.

It marks the latest livestream for Disney+, which aired Elton John’s farewell concert from Dodger Stadium show earlier this year.

The move follows some criticism of the event after Jann Wenner, founder of Rolling Stone magazine and co-founder of the Rock Hall, was ousted from the foundation after an interview that was considered racist and misogynistic by many. He later apologized.

This year’s inductees are Kate Bush, Sheryl Crow, Missy Elliott, George Michael, Willie Nelson, Rage Against the Machine and The Spinners with other awards for DJ Kool Herc, Link Wray, Chaka Khan, Al Kooper, Bernie Taupin and Don Cornelius.

Performers at the November ceremony include Sheryl Crow, Missy Elliott, Chaka Khan and Willie Nelson as well as special guests Brandi Carlile, Dave Matthews, H.E.R., Chris Stapleton, St. Vincent, New Edition.

“This historic live stream on Disney+ and special on ABC is a testament to the diverse sounds and enduring power of rock and roll,” said John Sykes, chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. “Over the last three decades, the annual live Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction has become music’s highest honor, celebrating the artists who’ve defined generations and changed music forever.”

“The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony has been the home to some of the most memorable moments in music history and celebrates the immeasurable impact these artists have had on the industry and culture,” added Rob Mills, EVP, Unscripted and Alternative Entertainment, Walt Disney Television. “We are so excited to offer audiences a front-row seat when they tune in on Disney+ and ABC.”
