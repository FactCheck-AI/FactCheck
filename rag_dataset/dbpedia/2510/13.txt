Each year, the Brandon Burlsworth Foundation gives a trophy to the most outstanding walk-on in the country.

The trophy was created in 2010 to honor former All-American Razorback walk-on, Brandon Burlsworth, who was tragically killed just 10 days after he was drafted to the Indianapolis Colts in the third round in 1999.

The committee announced the 81 players that have been nominated from Division I (FBS) schools from across the country on Wednesday. Out of those 81, 12 of the 14 SEC schools were represented.

Here are the SEC nominees:

Arkansas DB Hudson Clark

Auburn LS Jacob Quattlebaum

Florida PK Adam Mihalek

Georgia QB Stetson Bennett

Kentucky P Colin Goodfellow

LSU RB Josh Williams

Mississippi State LB Sherman Timbs

Missouri WR Barret Banister

Ole Miss TE Casey Kelly

South Carolina WR Payton Mangrum

Tennessee LS Matthew Salansky

Texas A&M DS Connor Choate

The award will be given out on Dec. 5 at the Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Ark.
