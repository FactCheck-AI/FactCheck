17th General elections were held in Japan on 20 February 1930. The Rikken Minseitō, which was led by Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi, won an overall majority in the House of Representatives. Voter turnout was 83.34%.

Due to the failure of Showa Economic Crisis and the National Unity Cabinet in 1927, which was launched to solve it, Minseito was able to win the 1928 election. The Hamaguchi Cabinet, which was formed, carried out strong corporate regulation and policies to stabilize people's livelihoods during its two-year rule. Prime Minister Hamaguchi has won widespread support among the public and the politician's great popularity has given Minseito confidence to hold the 1930 election.

Rikken Seiyukai, meanwhile, had not been properly assembled since the general election of 1928. Members who criticized the Takahashi Cabinet in 1924, joined the Shinsei Club led by Inukai Tsuyoshi through Seiyuhonto and won many seats in the 1928 election, sounding alarm over the division of conservatives. Seiyukai discussed the merger with the Shinsei Club, but with the sudden death of Party leader Tanaka Giichi in 1929, the merger discussion with the Shinsei Club came to nothing. Without a proper leader, Seiyukai elected Suzuki Kisaburo as the next leader, but Seiyukai was not ready for the next election.

As a result, the election ended in a landslide victory for Minseito, and Seiyukai compromised itself in two consecutive elections. The Shinsei Club also had a poor 42 seats, with talks of a merger with Seiyukai starting to flare up again. Meanwhile, Shakai Taishuto, led by Katayama Tetsu, made a significant move, winning 11 seats and other left-wing popular parties also won local seats. This election has cemented Hamaguchi Cabinet's support, but only nine months later, the cabinet was disbanded due to the assassination of Hamaguchi Osachi.
