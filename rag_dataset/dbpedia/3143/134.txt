The beginnings of Westminster School can be traced to 1386-7, when Queen Eleanor's accounts show a payment to one master of grammar and 22 boys. It was properly established under the Tudors, and Queen Elizabeth I has been credited with founding the Westminster School in 1560. The Queen provided funds to house and educate 40 boys in Latin, Greek, and Scripture. The brightest of these, Queen's Scholars, would be funded by the Queen to continue their studies at Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1575, the age limit was set to over eight and under eighteen.

The school was highly respected in the early 17th century, not least for its learned Masters and Deans, such as William Camden, Lancelot Andrewes and Lord Chancellor Williams. Westminster School can lay claim to the childhood education of notables like Ben Jonson, Abraham Cowley, George Herbert, and possibly Robert Herrick.
