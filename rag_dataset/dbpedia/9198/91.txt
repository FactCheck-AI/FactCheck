BLACK LABEL is a lifestyle brand based in Boston, Massachusetts. Its founder, Ramsey Noel, believes that black is more than just a color. It's a lifestyle. Black represents elegance, power, and sophistication. Black is a color that, when worn, makes you feel powerful. And for many, the color black is associated with quality and refinement. BLACK LABEL was founded to produce and curate fine goods and organic beauty and wellness products that will help you live your best life in BLACK.

For purposes of the farmer's markets, we would be selling handcrafted body care products, such as creams, butters, hair masks, facial masks, etc.
