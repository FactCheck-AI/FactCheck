Sweet Tee (born Toi Jackson in Queens, New York) is an American rap recording artist. She began her rap career by being featured on the rap mix of Davy DMX's "The DMX Will Rock" along with Leonie J uncredited. After signing with Profile Records, she made her debut by collaborating with DJ Jazzy Joyce on the hit, "It's My Beat" in 1986. The former was a part of the crew, Idol Makers, led by Hurby Azor. A couple years later, her debut, and only album to date, It's Tee Time, was released. That same year, she released a Christmas single titled, "Let The Jingle Bells Rock". She and Joyce inspired other female rappers, like Queen Latifah, to get into the rap game. In 1993 and '94, Sweet Tee was featured on the singles, "This Is It Y'all" by Poizon Posse and "The Feelin'" by Tin Tin Out. The next year, she signed with the Def Jam Recordings subsidiary, JMJ Records, and under her new stage name, Suga, she released the single, "What's Up, Star?". It was included on Russell Simmons's The Show: The Soundtrack. Although she hasn't recorded any further albums, she continues to record non-album singles sporadically. Years later, in an interview, she explained that the reason she never followed-up with a second album is because the label execs wanted her next album to be a Salt-n-Pepa clone. She wasn't willing to do that, so she walked away instead. Sweet Tee is now the assistant director at Profile Records.
