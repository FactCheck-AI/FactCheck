VICTORIA’S Secret model Lais Ribeiro is clearly tickled to show off these Valentine’s Day undies.

She knows February 14 will be a big day with 6ft 11in basketball star fiance Joakim Noah, 35.

But the 30-year-old six-footer is looking forward to an even bigger occasion when they get married.

Lais and Joakim began dating in 2018 before getting engaged one year later.

It’s bound to be a height wedding.

Her son Alexandre, 12, from a previous relationship, suffers from autism.

She homeschools him and once admitted : "It’s really hard.

"My son is special needs and doesn’t learn the way the other kids learn, so it’s a different type of teaching.

"I’m also learning with him because I’m not American, so I’m interested in all American history and stuff. I’m not great at math so my fiancé helps him out with that."
