Mumbai: Kashmira Irani, who played Amber in the show 'Amber-Dhara', is making her comeback with Star Plus 'Manmarziya'. Kashmira who has been missing from the small screen for a while is often mistaken to be Sanaya Irani’s sister (because of their common last names). In fact, recent rumours even suggested that Kashmira was staying in the US for a few months and Sanaya took a break to visit her there.

Laughing off the reports, Karishma says, “I have read many such bizarre stories about Sanaya and me but the truth is that we have met only once at a mutual friend’s party. Other than that, I don’t claim to know her. We are not related to each other just because we share a surname. My real sister has been asking me to clear these rumours and tell the world that I have just one sibling, which is her!”
