SELKS is a free and open source Debian-based IDS/IPS/Network Security Monitoring platform released under GPLv3 from Stamus Networks. SELKS can be installed via docker-compose on any Linux or Windows OS. Once installed it is ready to use out of the box solution. SELKS ISOs are also available for air-gapped environments or bare metal or VM installation. SELKS is a showcase of what Suricata IDS/IPS/NSM can do and the network protocol monitoring logs and alerts it produces. As such any and all data in SELKS is generated by Suricata. The usage of Suricata data is further enhanced by Stamus' developed Scirius, a threat-hunting interface. The interface is specifically designed for Suricata events and combines a drill-down approach to pivot for quick exploration of alerts and NSM events. It includes predefined hunting filters and enhanced contextual views.
