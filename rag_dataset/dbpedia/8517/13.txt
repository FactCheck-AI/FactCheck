Kroonstad kro͞onˈstät [key], city, part and seat of Moqhaka local municipality, Free State prov., E central South Africa, on the Vals River. It is an agricultural and industrial center. There are grain elevators, and grain is shipped from the town. Kroonstad is also an important rail junction and has large marshaling yards. The town's chief industries are clothing manufacture, mineral processing, and the production of machine parts.

Kroonstad was founded in 1855. Its growth was stimulated by the discovery of gold in the region in the late 19th cent. After the fall of Bloemfontein during the South African War, it was (Mar. 13–May 11, 1900) the capital of the Orange Free State (see Free State). A technical college is in the city.
