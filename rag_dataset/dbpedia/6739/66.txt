David Bowie — The Glam-Rock King

The influence of Burroughs on rock music was unimaginable, so much so that a book was written about it (William S. Burroughs and the Cult of Rock ’n’ Roll).

Not only was the legendary David Bowie influenced by the writer, but so was a long list of storied and beloved musicians: Pink Floyd, Patti Smith, Joy Division, Lou Reed, Laurie Anderson, Tom Waits, Gary Numan, Steely Dan, Led Zeppelin and Kurt Cobain.

William Gibson — The Father of the Cyberpunk Genre

Burroughs also famously coined the name “Blade Runner” for the other seminal work of cyberpunk art, Blade Runner (1982).

A couple of other authors that have admitted to being influenced by Burroughs are Gilles Deleuze, J. G. Ballard, Poppy Z. Brite, Angela Carter (The Bloody Chamber), Jean Genet, Alan Moore (Watchmen), Kathy Acker and Ken Kesey (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest).
