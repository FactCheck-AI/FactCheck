Though she had been performing professionally since the late 1920s, as a teenager in Harlem, during its Renaissance, the immortal Billie Holiday didn't play a single night on the European continent until 1954. It was in that year that the great journalist and musician Leonard Feather, and a Swedish promoter organized the Jazz Club U.S.A. tour, named after Feather's wildly popular radio program. Featuring Red Norvo, Sonny Clark, and more, the centerpiece of Jazz Club U.S.A. was, undoubtedly, Lady Day. Recorded at various dates across the tour, Lady Love shows Holiday still had it, despite the turmoil, and drug and alcohol abuse, her voice remained strong, a stunning document of one of America's greatest treasures on her first ever tour of Europe.

The tragic tale of Billie Holiday involves a fractured childhood, a seemingly endless series of abusive men, and addictions to heroin and alcohol, all played out in the public eye after targeting by the FBI. Nevertheless, her huskily expressive voice is timeless and the way she brought blues phrasing into jazz was hugely influential. The 1956 release Lady Sings The Blues took its name from her shocking autobiography and the disc finds her on fine form throughout, the landmarks including the immortal "Strange Fruit," the defiant "God Bless The Child," the mournful "No Good Man" and the great title track. Classic Lady Day all the way!

Wax Love present a reissue of Billie Holiday's Lady Sings The Blues, originally released in 1956. Though her late career was marred by addiction and personal issues, and her chipper voice had grown raspy and hardened by the years and the pain, Lady Sings The Blues has come to be regarded as one of the finest albums of her career, despite a lack of critical enthusiasm at the time. Originally released in 1956, concurrently with her autobiography, Holiday was joined for these sessions by tenor saxophonist Paul Quinichette, trumpeters Charlie Shavers and Harry Edison, pianist Wynton Kelly, and guitarists Kenny Burrell and Barney Kessel. A beautiful, smoky, and slow-burning piece of jazz vocal history. Essential.

Wax Love present a reissue of Billie Holiday's At Jazz At The Philharmonic, originally released in 1954. Jazz At The Philharmonic was a concert series produced by the legendary Norman Granz all the way from 1944 to 1983. Billie Holiday performed several times in the 1940s and '50s and was even a member of the touring troupe late in her career. These sides were recorded in 1945 and 1946 with backing from legends like Illinois Jacquet, Lester Young, and Barney Kessel. Recorded at the height of her technical prowess and before her hard living affected her voice, these performances from Los Angeles and New York City are some of the finest live recordings of her career. Absolute essentials from a jazz legend.

Doxy present a reissue of Billie Holiday's The Blues Are Brewin', originally released in 1958. The Lady can sing the blues! A stunning collection of traditionals and blues pieces masterfully interpreted by the great Billie Holiday. 140 gram clear vinyl; First pressing comes in an edition of 500 (numbered).

"The material in this collection, blues in form or associative feeling, like old friends, is treated with knowing care. Framed in Sy Oliver big band settings that might evoke comparison with Basie, and in smaller, more intimate environs, (teaming up with friend and idol Louis Armstrong on two titles) 'Lady' is very much 'Lady', a jazz singer in the most compelling sense." --Burt Korall, from the original liner notes

Doxy present a reissue of Billie's Best, a selection drawn from Billie Holiday's recordings of the mid-1950s, originally released in 1992. Holiday's voice possessed a unique presence, a sound that seems lit up by a resilient vitality. Producer Norman Granz set Holiday among the small jazz combos that suited her talents best, groups that included some of the finest soloists of her generation, such as trumpeter Harry "Sweets" Edison and saxophonists Benny Carter and Ben Webster. Granz also supplied ideal rhythm sections, with pianist Jimmy Rowles and guitarists Kenny Burrell and Barney Kessel making appearances here. There's more room to stretch out than was available on the early Columbia and Commodore recordings, and the results are relaxed and profound treatments of some great songs.

From the original show announcement: "I am very proud to present now the singing star of our show. Her voice is the voice of jazz; a voice that cannot be imitated, that has become known throughout the world through a hundred celebrated records. She will be accompanied by Carl Drinkard on piano, Elaine Leighton on drums and Red Mitchell on bass. Ladies and gentlemen, the great Lady Day, Miss Billie Holiday!" "This album offers a potent reminder, drawn from three sources, of the Lady during those magic years, the 1940s and early 1950s, just before her lifestyle took its toll irrevocably. The live tracks were taped at a concert during the European tour, Billie's first (and, as it turned out, only) tour of the Continent." --from the original liner notes; pressed on Audiophile Clear Vinyl (ACV).

"After WWII, Billy Holiday, who had risen to fame in NYC, began to tour the West Coast extensively. The rare tracks on this album were recorded live during those post-war years in San Francisco and L.A. The tracks on side A, taken from a concert in San Francisco in the fall of 1946, find Billie at the top of her game, despite some inevitable surface noise due to the tracks being salvaged from old 78 acetates. The first four tracks on Side B, on the other hand, were recorded in L.A. sometime between 1944 and 1947, with a sextet led by the great Tiny Grimes on guitar, while the last two tunes (Easy To Love and Tenderly) were recorded sometime around 1952, with a superb back-up group featuring pianist Oscar Peterson and guitarist Barney Kessel."

"In 1939 when Billie Holiday's label refused to record the highly controversial 'Strange Fruit', she did not give up, but searched desperately for a label that was not afraid to take a risk. Thankfully Milt Gabler at Commodore Records, a fledgling independent jazz label, understood the importance of this song being recorded and released to the public and soon arranged for Holiday to record a session with him. The 'Strange Fruit session' for Commodore, was one of those historic moments and part of Billie Holiday's legend hinges on the tremendous courage it took for her go ahead and record this song, knowing that it might well mean the end of her career. Three other songs, found here, were also recorded at that session: 'Yesterdays', 'Fine And Mellow' and 'I Gotta Right To Sing the Blues', while due to contractual issues, the remaining Commodore sides were not recorded until five years later in 1944." 180 gram vinyl.
