Lida Baarova was a Czech-Austrian actress who is mostly known for her affair with Joseph Goebbels, who was the propaganda minister in the Third Reich. Initially her affair with Goebbels did not affect her acting career, but once Hitler forced him to end the affair, Lida’s acting career took a nose dive. Due to her association with Hitler and his party, Lida was jailed for a year and half (3) after the World War II. After she moved to Austria in 1956, she tried to revive her acting career by doing theatre. However, she was never able to resurrect her acting career. Her birth country, Czechoslovakia, never actually forgave her for her affair with Goebbels. She did mention in her biography that she regretted her affair, but argued that she was young and foolish. There is no doubt that her acting career was negatively impacted by her affair, because she did turn down an offer from Hollywood to remain the mistress of Goebbels. She has said in her biography that had she gone to Hollywood, she might have given Marlene Dietrich a stiff competition. ‘The Devil’s Mistress’ is a movie based on Baarova’s scandalous and tragic life.
