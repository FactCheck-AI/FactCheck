They were billed as the 'Olympics of Peace and Joy' but became the Olympics of terror--Munich 1972. An extreme Palestinian group called Black September held 11 Israeli athletes hostage in the Olympic village while the world looked on, incredulous. Using extraordinary archive footage, music and interviews with those who took part (including the only surviving member of the Black September group), "One day in September" tells the dramatic story of what happened in Munich during those 21 hours.
