A series of Japanese-style role-playing games notable for their historical settings and the Judgment Ring feature, which adds a timed element to turn-based combat. Koudelka is considered a precursor to the series. The first Shadow Hearts game retained much of the horror element that was predominant in Koudelka; subsequent installments gradually toned down this aspect. The first two Shadow Hearts games are directly connected to each other by plot, featuring the same protagonist.
