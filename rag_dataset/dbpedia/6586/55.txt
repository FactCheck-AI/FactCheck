The Shadow Hearts turn-based role-playing video game series for the PlayStation 2 consists of three main installments and a somewhat standalone initial release (Koudelka). Set in a twisted horror-fantasy version of the early 20th century that departs from actual events in selective and strange ways, Shadow Hearts gained cult popularity due to its unique, fictionalized “secret” world history and clever storytelling.
