Abortion is an important issue not only in the presidential race this year but in statewide elections as well, with pro-choice candidates facing anti-choice opponents in California, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Virginia, New York, Washington, Montana, Colorado, Ohio, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Texas.

In the Michigan US Senate race, polls show pro-choice Democratic candidate Debbie Stabenow leading anti-choice Republican candidate Spencer Abraham 50 to 44. Michigan’s Congressional District 8 race shows pro-choice Democratic candidate Dianne Byrum in a dead heat with Republican Mike Rogers. Byrum was trailing in earlier polls. Rogers is endorsed by Michigan Right to Life, and has stated that, if elected, he would stand by his belief “that abortion should be allowed only to protect the life of the mother.”
