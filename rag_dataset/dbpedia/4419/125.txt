“We would like to start this email by just asserting that MDI gave us some pretty brilliant interns! Too often people overlook recommendation for others for their merit and we just could not. From the moment they arrived on site and began learning, they never once quit or stopped growing. Things that take technicians in our experience to learn or understand only took them moments equivalently. We just had to send some praise their way and yours for the help, and would REALLY like to see them again in the future.”
