At the age of 22, Alvaro Odriozola has been presented as a new Real Madrid signing and he has picked the No.19 for the back of his shirt.

The former Real Sociedad player has inherited the number from Achraf Hakimi, his predecessor at Los Blancos' right-back position and a player who has moved on a two-year loan to Borussia Dortmund.

"[Choosing] the No.19 was an easy decision, as it gave me luck at Real Sociedad and it was also available here," said Odriozola during his presentation.

Apart from the Basque, however, there are various players to have donned the No.19 shirt over the years and MARCA presents them below.
