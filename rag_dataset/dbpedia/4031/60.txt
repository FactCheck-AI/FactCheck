Dec 30 (Reuters) - Iraq's most-capped player Younis Mahmoud was named in the 23-man squad for next month's Asian Cup despite not playing for a club for more than a year. The 31-year-old forward, who skippered the side to the 2007 Asian Cup title, has scored more than 50 goals for Iraq in more than 130 appearances but has not had a club contract since leaving Saudi Arabian outfit Al Ahli in December last year. The talisman has instead represented Iraq's mainly under-23 side at the Asian Games in September, where they won a bronze medal after he scored four goals. Younis was the only player aged over 30 named in Radhi Shenaishil's squad on Monday for the Group D matches in Australia against holders Japan and fellow west Asian sides Palestine and Jordan. Colombus Crew forward Justin Meram, Swindon Town midfielder Yaser Kasim and talented 18-year-old playmaker Human Tareq were also named in the 23. Sydney FC midfielder Ali Abbas, part of the 2007 winning side, missed out on a place in the squad after suffering a serious knee injury last month.
