JNS.org – Israel Hayom continues to be the widest-read daily newspaper in Israel, according to the latest Target Group Index (TGI) report reviewing media consumption in the Jewish state in 2015.

According to the report, published Wednesday, Israel Hayom’s exposure rate on an average weekday was 39.5 percent in 2015 — up from 39.3 percent in 2014.

The report noted that Israel Hayom held a statistically significant lead over its closest competitor, Yedioth Ahronoth, which had a 35.4 percent exposure rate on an average weekday in 2015.

Israel Hayom CEO Tzipi Koren said, “We are deeply grateful to our readers, who have made us the top newspaper in Israel for the past five years already. Their unwavering loyalty is a strong tailwind that pushes us forward and gives us fortitude and inspiration.”

The TGI report reviews media consumption among Jewish Israelis ages 18 and older, representing a population of 4.2 million people, on an annual and semi-annual basis. The report is based on a survey conducted by Kantar Media TGI Research and is supervised by the Israeli Advertising Association.
