The Wales and West Acute Transport for Children Service (WATCh) is a jointly commissioned team responsible for the safe transfer of critically ill children across South West England and South Wales.

The team co-ordinates the transfer of children into the regional PICUs and HDUs in Cardiff and Bristol.

Referral calls from hospital staff are made to the WATCh hotline: the WATCh team will provide management advice for all patients and, together with local clinicians, determine the best place for ongoing care.
