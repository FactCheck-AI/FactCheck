Today's play of the day comes all the way from the Norwegian football league, where Icelandic striker Matthias Vilhjálmsson scored an outlandish bicycle kick.

With the score at 0-0, Vilhjálmsson - who has played 13 games for the Icelandic national team - found the best possible way to break the deadlock.

Vilhjálmsson's side went on to win 3-1.
