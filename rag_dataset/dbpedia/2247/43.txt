Death Angel will play their 8th Annual X-Mas Shows at The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco, CA on December 21 and 22. Both shows will be opened by the recently reunited Forbidden, with Frolic joining in on December 21 and Tornadic on December 22.

The bad news is that in-person tickets are sold out. The good news is that both shows will be livestreamed in full, and will feature a virtual merchandise booth with exclusive Death Angel merchandise to boot.

"Tis The season! The eighth annual 'Another Death Angel Christmas' shows are coming up!" said Death Angel in part of the shows. "And what once was a Bay Area Thrash Metal tradition is now something we want to make A World Wide Thrash Metal tradition! We will be making both shows available to view via a live stream from The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco."
