Denmark (Danmark) is a country in Northern Europe, located south-west of Sweden, south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. Denmark has two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Faroe Islands (Føroyar in Faroese; Færøerne in Danish) and Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat in Greenlandic; Grønland in Danish)).

Profiles belonging to Denmark should be categorised by the parish in which they were born, married or died. The creation of parish categories is a work in progress.
