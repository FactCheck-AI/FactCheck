A dream is all it takes to go the distance. The story of Famous Studios, standing tall as a landmark of Mumbai’s dream industry was born from a similar dream. Set up in 1946, in pre-Independence India, it was a bold foray into the world of Indian cinema and television. Over the years, it evolved into a canvas for hundreds of artists for creating masterpieces with state-of-the-art equipment and expert technicians: a turnkey content solutions provider for anything that a business or film needs. Today the studios have spread into a sprawling 110,000 sq ft, to several locations across Mumbai to boost flexibility, and also to the hearts of industry folk. Famous Studios has been honoured with Dadasaheb Phalke and the Indian Motion Picture Association’s recognition for its outstanding contribution to Indian Cinema, in addition to dozens of other accolades and awards. Yet our greatest reward remains the joy and fulfilment of those who weave a million dreams every day.
