Attorneys for former Senate President Stan Rosenberg and his estranged husband Bryon Hefner are asking the court to reveal the identity of an unnamed accuser.

The Boston Herald reports that lawyers for the two have argued in a filing in Suffolk Superior Court that the alleged victim's request to remain anonymous shouldn't outweigh the court's standard of having parties in a lawsuit reveal their names.

The civil lawsuit filed last month alleges the former Democratic Senate president knew Hefner posed a risk to individuals at the Massachusetts Statehouse and Rosenberg and Hefner had an agreement or understanding allowing Hefner access to those individuals.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of an unnamed plaintiff who said Hefner grabbed his genitals without consent on more than one occasion.

Rosenberg resigned in May.
