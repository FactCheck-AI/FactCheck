What Does Dharmachakra Mudra Mean?

Dharmachakra mudra, used by Buddha during his first sermon following his enlightenment, represents continuous flow of energy. Dharmachakra is a Sanskrit word which means “the wheel of dharma.” The mudra also symbolizes kalachakra, which refers to the time cycles.

To perform this mudra, bring the tips of the thumb and index fingers of both hands together to form a circle. Keep the remaining three fingers stretched. Place the hands at heart level with the left palm facing the heart and right palm facing outward.

Yogapedia Explains Dharmachakra Mudra

Dharmachakra mudra is considered a representation of Buddha’s teachings about the cosmic order from the heart. The teaching sets into motion the wheel of dharma.

The cycle formed with the fingers represents the wheel of dharma. The left hand, which faces the heart, represents the inner world while the right represents the surrounding world. In metaphysical terms, the circle represents the union of method and wisdom. The jewels of Buddhism, which are Buddha, dharma and sangha, are represented by the three stretched fingers of the left hand.

The middle finger of the right hand denotes the listeners of Buddha’s teachings. The ring finger represents the realizers of Buddha’s teachings. The little finger refers to mahayana, “the great vehicle,” which is one of the branches of Buddhism.

Practicing dharmachakra mudra calms the mind and elevates the state of the mind to a higher plane. The mudra also improves focus and helps to maintain positive attitude.

Dharmachakra mudra can be practiced with padmasana while in meditation to maximize its benefits.
