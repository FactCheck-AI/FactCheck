BERLIN // Bayern Munich began their defence of the German Cup with a comfortable 4-1 first-round win away to third-tier side Preussen Munster on Sunday.

Pep Guardiola’s starting line-up was deprived of the injured Bastian Schweinsteiger and there was no Franck Ribery, but it did feature five members of the Germany side that won the World Cup five weeks ago.

The man who scored the winning goal against Argentina at the Maracana, Mario Goetze, opened the scoring for Bayern with a header from a Robert Lewandowski cross, before Thomas Mueller doubled their lead.

David Alaba and Claudio Pizarro added further efforts in the second half but Lewandowski, chasing his first goal for the club since his move from Borussia Dormtund, had a late penalty saved.

Four days after losing Spanish international Javi Martinez to a serious knee injury in their German SuperCup defeat to Borussia Dortmund, Guardiola handed a start in defence to Holger Badstuber, who has been out injured for the last 20 months.

Meanwhile, Hoffenheim won 9-0 away to fifth-tier amateurs Paloma in Hamburg, with Sven Schipplock scoring five of the goals. However, Werder Bremen required extra time before winning 3-2 away to fifth-tier opposition in Illertissen.

Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen also progressed this weekend, but top-flight sides Mainz and VfB Stuttgart fell by the wayside.

Three trading apps to try

Sharad Nair recommends three investment apps for UAE residents:

For beginners or people who want to start investing with limited capital, Mr Nair suggests eToro. “The low fees and low minimum balance requirements make the platform more accessible,” he says. “The user interface is straightforward to understand and operate, while its social element may help ease beginners into the idea of investing money by looking to a virtual community.”

If you’re an experienced investor, and have $10,000 or more to invest, consider Saxo Bank. “Saxo Bank offers a more comprehensive trading platform with advanced features and insight for more experienced users. It offers a more personalised approach to opening and operating an account on their platform,” he says.

Finally, StashAway could work for those who want a hands-off approach to their investing. “It removes one of the biggest challenges for novice traders: picking the securities in their portfolio,” Mr Nair says. “A goal-based approach or view towards investing can help motivate residents who may usually shy away from investment platforms.”
