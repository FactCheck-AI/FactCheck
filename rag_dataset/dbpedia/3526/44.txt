Electronic Arts has unveiled Burnout Dominator for PlayStation 2 and PSP, due out in 2007.

That's in addition, obviously, to Burnout 5, which is due out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

"The series was born on the PlayStation 2, and Burnout Dominator is about celebrating the essence of Burnout," said Nick Channon, senior producer.

"Burnout Dominator focuses on the reckless skill-based racing and fear of crashing that fuelled the first games."

And that's pretty much all we know, other than it's currently underway at EA UK in Guildford.

So there's no word on whether the two will link up via USB or anything like that, or even much about what to expect - other than Burnout's trademark intensely destructive racing action.

More soon, hopefully.
