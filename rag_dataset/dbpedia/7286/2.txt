The Geneva School of Manhattan is the only Preschool through Twelfth Grade classical Christian school in New York City. We are dedicated to providing an exceptional education within a biblical framework that helps students love God and love learning.

Our vision is to cultivate abundant growth in each student, at Geneva School and far beyond.

Vibrant community nourishes hearts with love.

Our community is defined by genuine love for one another. Geneva School families reflect the racial, socioeconomic, and denominational diversity of New York City and find common ground through shared faith and mission. By Godâs grace, we seek for Geneva School to be a place where parents and students are loved and supported in all areas of life.

Student Life

Classical methods lay a solid foundation for curious minds.

We follow a classical approach to education. Classical learning leverages the natural stages of child development to educate students in three phases: grammar, logic, and rhetoric. This rigorous, highly-interactive approach aims to develop lifelong learners who are able to think critically and engage persuasively in all areas of life.

Classical Learning

Beliefs rooted in Christian faith invite souls to grow toward God.

Christian faith shapes who we are. In all areas we seek the steadying framework of Godâs Word to support the spiritual development of each student. Students are encouraged to explore deep spiritual truths and to allow those truths to instruct their actions.Â
