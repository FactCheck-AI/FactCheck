The Geneva School of Manhattan was founded with a vision to serve the families of New York City.

The Geneva School of Manhattan was founded in 1996 by two New York City educators as the only classical Christian school in the city. In a place of endless opportunities and unique pressures, our founders saw a need for a school built on time-tested foundations, both academically and spiritually. For almost thirty years Geneva School has provided an academic environment that nourishes the God-given potential in each studentâs mind, soul, and heart.
