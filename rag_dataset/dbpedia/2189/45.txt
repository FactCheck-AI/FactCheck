Ella's 1960 Verve holiday album - featuring "Frosty The Snow Man", "Winter Wonderland", "Sleigh Ride" and many more - has been a swingin' yuletide tradition for over 60 years. The album was recorded in the summer of 1960, with a studio orchestra arranged and conducted by Frank DeVol. An ebullient Ella Fitzgerald exudes warmth, spirit and good cheer, as if to ask: Why not the peace and good will of Christmas the year 'round? These twelve happy, winter songs suggest that yours be a Swinging Christmas - anytime, all the time!
