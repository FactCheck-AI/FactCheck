KARACHI: Legendary Shahenshah-e-Qawwali, Sufi and music legend, Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was remembered on his 71st birth anniversary on Sunday (today).

He is popularly regarded as “Shahenshah-e-Qawwali”, meaning “The King of Qawwali”.

Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was born in Faisalabad on 13th October, 1948, and is considered one of the trend-setters and pioneers of fusion music in Pakistan.
