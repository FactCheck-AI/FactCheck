According to one story, Levin and 1/2 brother Urias drowned at sea in Dec. 1879 on the ship "The Cherubim." Albert Lank stated that the two died three days apart at sea of yellow fever. One was captain and the other was mate on the Cherubim, believed to have been owned or partly owned by their father. The seamen aboard were Negroes, and they were alive and well when the ship was picked up for salvage off the Atlantic coast and towed into port. The owners of the ship were unable to pay the salvage bill as there was no insurance, thereby losing the ship. The Lank family has always believed that the brothers met with foul play aboard their ship, as their bodies were never recovered. / Levin's father bequeathed $1500, real estate (except for a half parcel of bog used for cranberrying and purchased from Robt. Colbourn) plus 1/3 interest in his seine and tackle; also "all the... land whereon I now live," and the adjoining 40 acre tract originally purchased from Samuel Chipman.
