History[edit | edit source]

Following the call of applications of the CSA for the launch of six new channels on the DTT, Groupe M6 presented three projects of channels: 6ter, M6 Boutique & Co and Hexa. On March 27, the CSA chose 6ter to be part of the 6 new channels to be launched on December 12, 2012, in HDTV (1080i).

Like its sisters M6 and W9, 6ter have a Swiss subfeed, which air in Swiss providers and in free-to-air on satellite.

6ter's programming is family-oriented. 6ter shows magazines, documentaries, educational programs, along with children programmes, series and movies.
