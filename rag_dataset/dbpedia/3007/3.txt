Greek refugees at Gallipoli Town during Chanak Crisis

Greek refugees at Gallipoli Town awaiting passports during the Chanak Crisis (Chanak Affair, Chanak Incident) - a war scare in September 1922 between Britain and Republic of Turkey. The incident was caused by Turkish efforts to push Greek forces out of Turkey to restore Turkish rule in the Allied occupied territories of Turkey. Turkish troops marched against British and French positions in the Dardanelles neutral zone, but the crisis quickly ended when Turkey, having overwhelmed the Greeks, agreed to a negotiated settlement that gave it the territory it wanted. There was no war. Due to his perceived mishandling of the crisis the incident led to the downfall of Prime Minister David Lloyd George. Date: 1922

EDITORS COMMENTS

In this poignant photograph, a crowd of Greek refugees huddle together at Gallipoli Town, eagerly awaiting the issuance of their passports during the chaotic final days of the Chanak Crisis. The Chanak Crisis, also known as the Chanak Affair or Chanak Incident, was a war scare that erupted in September 1922 between the British and Turkish forces. The crisis was ignited by Turkish efforts to push Greek forces out of Turkey and restore Turkish rule in the Allied-occupied territories. As tensions escalated, Turkish troops marched against British and French positions in the Dardanelles neutral zone. The situation quickly became precarious, with the possibility of a full-blown war looming on the horizon. However, the crisis came to a sudden and unexpected end when Turkey, having overwhelmed the Greeks, agreed to a negotiated settlement that gave it the territory it wanted. Despite the absence of a war, the Chanak Crisis had far-reaching consequences. The incident led to the downfall of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who was widely criticized for his perceived mishandling of the crisis. For the refugees in this photograph, the end of the crisis meant the beginning of a long and arduous journey towards a new life, as they fled their homes in search of safety and security. The image of these refugees at Gallipoli Town, with their hopeful expressions and bundled belongings, serves as a powerful reminder of the human cost of political instability and the enduring resilience of the human spirit. This photograph was taken in Gallipoli Town, Turkey, in 1922, during the height of the Chanak Crisis. The scene unfolds in the bustling port town of Sultanieh, now known as Kale, located on the European side of the Dardanelles Strait. The 1920s, a decade marked by political upheaval and economic uncertainty, provide the backdrop for this poignant moment in history.
