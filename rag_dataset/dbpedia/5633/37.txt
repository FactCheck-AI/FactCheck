On the back of the dvd cover for Ocean's Twelve it says (on the 12 cert logo)

"Some audible bad language has been bleeped out"

Why I ask ?

You can only say some swear words once in a 12 cert movie. If they use the big F Word twice, the movie will become a 15 cert.

Hi,

According to the BBFC:

Ocean's Twelve (Cinema Version)

- Contains one audible and some bleeped uses of strong language

- No cuts or alterations made (by the BBFC).

Ocean's Twelve (Vides/DVD Version)

- Contains one audible and some bleeped uses of strong language

- No cuts or alterations made (by the BBFC) from the original cinema version.

Other than that, there doesn't appear to be any further information about censorship to this movie. I suspect, therefore, that the bleeped uses of strong language were undertaken in the USA by the movie's distributors, so that it would be acceptable for a US "PG-13" rating, and a UK "12" rating. They clearly wanted the strong language to be understood, but not heard, so that youngsters and parents didn't get upset.

I should mention I've not seen the film, so can't comment on when or how the bleeps are used in it.

I don't recall the scene in question (tried to block the film out of my memory!) but i'd imagine it was filmed that way. I can't see any filmmakers allowing their movies to be censored by bleeps. Possibly a bleeped tv/movie scene in the film (if that makes sense!)

Just watched this tonight and the scene in question definitely appears to have been filmed that way and the bleeping is part of the joke. In fact Don 'English accent supremo' Cheadle even mentions the bleeping.

Yep thats definitely the whole point (some might argue that Mr Cheadles accent is the bigger joke )

Oceans 12 was my fave out of the lot. Love the fact it feels like a European film rather than a Hollywood film......infact easily the most stylish film in the last decade.
