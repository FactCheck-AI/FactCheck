973 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10075

973 Fifth Avenue is one of the most notable residences remaining in private hands today. It is built by the most sought after architect in American history, on the finest block of Fifth Avenue; the only block on the Upper East Side where no high rise apartment will ever be allowed. This entire block of Fifth Avenue is called the Cook Block, and this house was built for that same, Mr. Henry Cook.

The house has been meticulously restored and completely modernized beneath its stately surface which amazingly escaped the ravages of passing tastes and destructive architectural design whims of the intervening 115 years since it was built in 1906. It remains an intact masterpiece of one of the greatest architectural firms in American history, McKim Meade and White. It is irreplaceable, rare and highly coveted. Every modern convenience has been added and every system upgraded with an effortless elegance that never interrupts the easy grace and quiet impressiveness of this residence.

The house has a full frontage on Fifth Avenue with glorious views from entertaining rooms with over 16 foot ceilings easily topping the trees and affording wonderful views over Central Park. There are grand rooms for formal entertaining and cozy rooms for intimate gathering, both with handsome original details, paneling and lovely park views. The house spans 7 floors and encompasses over 15,000 square feet. Every inch has been given a thorough reconstruction. At the very top of the residence, a marvelous rooftop garden and patio has been built, lifting you high above Central Park with open 180 degree views to the west side skyline and the tippy glass towers of Midtown Manhattan.
