The least populated sovereign country in Africa, Seychelles, has slowly begun to take its place amongst other African countries after being known for their warm personalities and increased tourist activity, especially after the pandemic in 2020.

Seychelles is an archipelago of about 115 islands in East Africa on the Western Indian Ocean. The country has two main island groups: Mahé group, comprised of more than 40 mountainous islands located towards the country’s center, and a second group known as Praslin, with more than 70 flat coralline islands on the outer banks.

The Seychellois are particularly popular for the country’s unique diversity and even more for their culture, enriched very deeply by African, Asian, and European influence, which It has managed to meld in a very harmonious manner.

Seychelles Population

Even while experiencing massive growth in the past few years, the population of Seychelles is only a minuscule 99,967 making them one of the least populated African countries. Still, it is very understandable due to the size of the country.

Of the 115 islands that make up the country, eight (8) are inhabitable. Most of the country’s population lives on the main island, Mahé, followed by Praslin and La Digue.

Listed below are the significant ethnicities in Seychelles:

Seychellois Creole: accounts for about 90% of the total population on the Islands, and Seychellois are said to be people of mixed origin, which may include French, British, Middle Eastern, Chinese, and African roots.

Indo-Seychellois: this is a minority ethnic group of people of Indian descent who comprise about 6% of the total population. The majority of them are Hindus who hail from Tamil Nadu. Others include Indian Jains, Muslims, Christians, etc.

Sino-Seychellois: also a minority ethnic group, these Chinese immigrants moved from Mauritius to the island in the 18th century. Their population is estimated at 1,000 individuals, which makes them one of the minor Chinese groups in Africa.

Religion

As a country influenced by multiple cultures and different societies, it is common knowledge that the populace practices a multitude of religions. This is allowed by the Seychelles government, as the constitution guarantees the freedom of religion and expression. It is also important to note that the Seychelles government doesn’t favor any religion. There is freedom of expression and choosing the religion of one’s choice without pressure from the government or people.

Most people in Seychelles practice Christianity. Roman Catholicism is the largest denomination in the country (82% of the population), with other minor denominations like the Anglican Church (6.4% of the population), Seventh-day Adventists, Pentecostals, and various Protestant denominations also present.

The second largest religion in Seychelles is Hinduism, which can be credited to the Indo-Seychellois populace of the country. They make up around 2.5% of the Seychellois population, closely followed by Islam, which is practiced by about 1.6% of the population, about 900 people.

Family Life in Seychelles

In contrast to most African countries, the Seychelles basic family unit is matriarchal, and the woman holds superior status to the man in the working class. But while women control many of the economic resources in the homes, domestic violence is still quite common, especially with women being on the receiving end.

In Seychelles, education is highly valued, and families are encouraged to give their children an opportunity to get a good education. The Seychelles government provides free education for children until they reach the age of 18, and families are urged to enroll their children.

Seychelles is a country that prioritizes community and social cohesion, which is evident in how families connect. Weddings and funerals are crucial family gatherings and festivities, and families frequently assemble to celebrate and support one another.
