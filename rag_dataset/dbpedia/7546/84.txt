Seychelles, an archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, is a melting pot of cultures and languages. With a rich history of British and French colonization, it is no surprise that the people of Seychelles are multilingual. In this blog post, we will delve into the languages spoken in this fascinating country and how they reflect the cultural diversity of Seychelles.

The Official Languages

There are three official languages spoken in Seychelles: Seychellois Creole, English, and French. Here we will explore each of these languages and their prevalence in society.

Seychellois Creole

Seychellois Creole, also known as Kreol Seselwa, is the most widely spoken language on the islands and is used by approximately 95% of the population. It is a French-based Creole language with influences from African, Malagasy, and Indian languages. Seychellois Creole emerged during the 18th century when African slaves who arrived on the islands mixed their native languages with the French spoken by their captors. The language has evolved over the years, incorporating new words and expressions from other languages.

English

English is the second official language of Seychelles and is commonly used in government, business, and education. Since gaining independence from Britain in 1976, English has been increasingly promoted in schools and used as a lingua franca amongst the population. Today, many Seychellois are bilingual in English and Creole, with some also fluent in French.

French

The French language, being a remnant of the islands’ history as a French colony, is still prevalent in Seychelles. French is widely spoken amongst the older generation, who were educated in French prior to Seychelles gaining independence. It is also common to see signage and official documents in French alongside English and Creole.

Other Languages Spoken in Seychelles

Besides the three official languages, there are other languages spoken by minority groups in Seychelles, reflecting the diverse cultural heritage of the island nation.

Chinese and Indian Languages

Due to the historical presence of Chinese and Indian traders and immigrants, the Seychelles is home to communities that speak a variety of Chinese and Indian languages, such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Hindi, and Tamil. These languages are mainly spoken within their respective communities and are not as widespread as Creole, English, and French.

This demonstrates Seychelles’ commitment to embracing diversity and racial acceptance. The country warmly invites investments and businesses from a global spectrum.
