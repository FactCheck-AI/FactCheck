Formula Junior (FJ) was the third-level racing class (after Formula one and Formula Two) for open-wheels formula cars. FJ was introduced by CSI (International Sporting Commission) in 1958 as a class for single-seater racing cars where younger drivers could take their first steps. The rules for the class required the cars to be powered by production-based engines with a maximum volume of 1,000 cc with a 360 kg car or 1,100 cc with a 400 kg car – in practice the latter was used in almost all successful FJ cars.

Many manufacturers from UK, Italy and other countries proved their abilities in FJ. Lotus also came into the game with their Lotus 18, a simplified derivative of their Formula One and Formula Two chassis fitted with a 997 cc Ford Anglia engine. In the 1960 British FJ season Team Lotus raced Lotus 18 driven by Jim Clark, Trevor Taylor and Peter Arundel. There were more than 60 FJ races in UK that year, including eight rounds of BRSCC (British Racing & Sports Car Club) John Davy Championship. Jim Clark and Trevor Taylor were ex-aequo einners of the BRSCC championship. Clark also won several non-championship FJ events including FJ race at VII International Gold Cup at Oulton Park circuit.
