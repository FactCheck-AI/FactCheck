Semi-Pros & Yankee Contract

On October 1, 1932, Joe made his professional debut. He participated in the final three games of the season. Hitting became his main incentive when he hit safely in 61 straight games in his first full season, setting a PCL record and the second-longest stretch in Minor League Baseball history.

But in 1934, while he was getting out of a taxi, Joe sustained a possibly fatal knee injury that tore ligaments. Convinced that the injury would heal, New York Yankees scout Bill Essick persuaded the team to examine it more closely. After passing the physical, the Yankees acquired Joe DiMaggio’s contract for $50,000 and five players. He batted for the Seals the entire 1935 season. He batted 398, with 34 home runs and 154 runs batted in. Joe was awarded Most Valuable Player, and the Seals won the PCL championship.
