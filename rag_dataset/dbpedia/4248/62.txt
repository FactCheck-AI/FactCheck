Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18th December 1878 - 1955) was a Georgian Soviet politician and a participant in the power struggle following Vladimir Lenin's death, which he ultimately lost to Nikolai Bukharin.

History

Stalin was involved with the Bolsheviks since its early days, organizing bank robberies and other criminal activities to fund the party. During the Russian Civil War, he led the army that captured Tsaritsyn from White Forces. Stalin, along with Nikolai Bukharin, were the main contenders for power in the USSR, after Lenin's death. However, Bukharin won the party struggle against his former ally. In the aftermath of the USSR's defeat in World War II, Stalin and his faction fled to West Siberia and set up a government in Tyumen, which collapsed following his death in 1955.
