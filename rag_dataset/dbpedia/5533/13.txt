Description

Montaillou Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie

Cathars and Catholics in a French village. Montaillou was the last village which actively supported the Cathar heresy and this study is based upon the testaments of peasants examined by the Inquisition of Jacques Fournier, Bisphop of Pamiers in Ariege in the Comte de Foix (now Southern France). The depositions made to the Inquisition courts were meticulously recorded and offer an extraordinarily detailed and vivid picture of everyday life.
