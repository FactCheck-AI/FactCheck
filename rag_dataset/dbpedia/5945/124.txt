🌟 Exciting Analysis from Wood Mackenzie on SOCAR and ADNOC Collaboration 🌟 📢 In the News: On May 31, 2024, ADNOC announced awarding SOCAR a 3% stake in the Satah al Razboot (SARB) and Umm Lulu offshore concession. These two oil fields, located offshore Abu Dhabi, are under development by ADNOC Offshore. The fields are separate, located over 85 kilometers apart. Umm Lulu uses offshore production platforms, while SARB was developed via artificial islands. In 2018, CEPSA and OMV were awarded 20% stakes each in the concession. Last year, TotalEnergies acquired CEPSA's 20% stake. 📊 WoodMac Analysis: ADNOC is returning the favor! Last year, the Abu Dhabi oil giant acquired a 30% stake in the Absheron gas field in Azerbaijan from SOCAR and TotalEnergies. For SOCAR, forming a strategic partnership with a Middle Eastern NOC has been a long-held aspiration. This is the second instance where ADNOC has reduced its typical 60% stake to bring in new partners. The first was in 2019 when a 5% stake in the Ghasha concession was awarded to LUKOIL. ADNOC’s stake in the gas project dropped to 55%, but it recently increased to 70% after acquiring an additional 15% stake from Eni. Advancing geopolitical and strategic relationships appears to be the main driver in these moves. #OilAndGas #Energy #SOCAR #ADNOC #WoodMackenzie #StrategicPartnership #OffshoreDevelopment #EnergyNews #Geopolitics
