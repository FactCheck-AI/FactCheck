Full Steam Ahead was an unique cultural event done in Finland, in the summer of 2013.

Where Makia, to honor their SS14 â€“collection, sailed the coastal area of Helsinki, with the 14 most interesting bands in Finland, aboard the steamboat s/s Norrkulla. The entire trip was documented and it offers an insight to current Finnish music scene, through the most promising bands. Starring in the documentary are the bands from the tour: Rubik, K-X-P, Phantom, Lau Nau, Husky Rescue, TWWTH, Damn Seagulls, Reino Nordin / Bongo Rock, Tuomo, Sara Sayed, Sarah Kivi & Non-Orchestra, Death Hawks, Black Lizard and Big Wave Riders.
