Description

Tough Queens cop Mike Keegan (Tom Berenger) is assigned the late shift of a round-the-clock watch to protect a beautiful New York socialite (Mimi Rogers) from a killer she must testify against. Despite a seemingly stable marriage, Keegan begins to fall for his attractive charge. Sleek and stylish, romantic and atmospheric, this is director Ridley Scott doing what he does best.
