As a subscriber I get mag early.

8 page interview with Jon and album review.

They gave it 7/10

Said the best song is Waves and Living in Paradise and the 2 ballads, Kiss The Bride and My first guitar are...... underwhelming.

Well it couldn't get a score like 2020! but it's promising, but expecting 12 rockish songs isn't going happen for fans hoping for it on "Forever" or another Album(s)......

Surprised they didn't list "Hallow Man" and "We made it easy" in addition to "Kiss the Bride" we shall see if "My first guitar" is as bad as they say it is.

I'm sure 2020, didn't get a 5! I do like it except "American Reckoning", "Do what you can" "Unbroken" and "Lower the Flag". Though American Reckoning and Lower the Flag I can tolerate now and again......

If memory serves...

HAND 7/10

LH - can't remember

Circle - Can't remember

WAN - 1/10

THINFS - 6/10

2020 - 6/10 (Might be 7).

Interviews decent as well.

Admits his voice was shit at Wembley 19

Says he's heart broken Richie left and has made no attempt to come back. Said he's seen him twice since he left. Hall of fame and watching doc.

I think some fans would disagree on a 6/7 for 2020....

I do wish the media would stop asking about Richie Sambora, if it does happen the fans and media will know.....

I did think in parts Wembley in 2019 was good, Blood on Blood and Always were good IMO.

Compared to 2022....The question is will Bon Jovi ever tour again? who knows?

I have a feeling if live voice didn't improve, it will be just a farewell with Richie Sambora perhaps? when he wants to stop making albums.....Let's hope he can get back-out there before he calls it a day.....
