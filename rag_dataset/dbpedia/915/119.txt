Railway station in North Ayrshire, Scotland

Irvine railway station is a railway station serving the town of Irvine, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the Ayrshire Coast Line, 30 miles (48 km) south west of Glasgow Central.

History

The station opened on 5 August 1839 as part of the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway.[3] There was a branch leaving here for Crosshouse and Kilmarnock which closed in 1965.[4] During the electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line by British Rail, Irvine station was partially refurbished, resulting in a glass front canopy on the main building and external ramp access to both platforms.

Facilities

The station is staffed on a full-time basis seven days a week.[5] There is a small kiosk shop and an adjoining car park with 100 spaces. Train running information is offered via digital CIS displays, automated announcements, timetable posters and customer help points on each platform. Step-free access is available to both sides of the station.

Services

Mondays to Saturdays there are 4 trains per hour northbound to Glasgow Central and 4 trains per hour southbound to Ayr with a half-hourly service in each direction on Sundays.[6]
