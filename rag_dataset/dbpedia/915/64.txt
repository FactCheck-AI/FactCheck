Dalry railway station is a railway station serving the town of Dalry, North Ayrshire, Scotland. The station is managed by ScotRail and is on the Ayrshire Coast Line.

History

The station was opened on 21 July 1840 by the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway. The station originally had two side platforms until the Dalry and North Johnstone Line was opened by the Glasgow and South Western Railway in 1905, when the station was remodeled with four platforms over two islands. Each new platform was 765 feet (233 m) long to accommodate the increased traffic, and were accessed via gangways from a covered walkway crossing the lines from the station building. The station also acted as the junction interchange between the line to Ayr and the original G&SWR main line to Kilmarnock, Dumfries and Carlisle from 1860 onwards, though the two routes actually separated a short distance to the west.

With the closure of both the Kilmarnock & North Johnstone lines to passenger traffic in 1966 and to all other traffic in 1973 (Kilmarnock line) & 1977 (North Johnstone Loop), having four lines through the station became superfluous, so the station platforms were remodelled during the line's electrification in the 1980s back to two side platforms. The Ayrshire Coast Line was electrified by British Rail.
