Before Oprah…before Ellen…there was Dinah Shore.

She was the queen of the afternoon talk show.

For over five decades, Dinah induced a state of joy into people wherever she appeared, a love affair between her and her audience.

In the fickle world of popular music, Dinah had a longer run at the top than any other girl singer, and on television, she had no equal in the musical field. Arguably, she was “the first lady of television.”

Dinah’s life, however, was not always easy. She was a Jewish girl growing up in the Deep South and, at an early age, suffered a bout with polio. Later, as she was just achieving success as a radio/recording artist, a vicious rumor threatened to scuttle her career.

Romantically, the lady was been involved with many men, from her first husband, actor George Montgomery, to Frank Sinatra, to her May/December affair with Burt Reynolds.

Then, there were the clandestine relationships.

Miss Dinah Shore is the candid story of a beloved woman whose career spanned almost all aspects of show business, from radio, records, movies, television variety and talk shows: a remarkable journey.
