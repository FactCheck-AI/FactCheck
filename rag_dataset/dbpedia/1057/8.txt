When I was 18, I joined the Royal Navy as a valet for Rear Admiral Torlesse. During my time at sea I had the honour of serving Prince Philip shortly after his marriage to Princess Elizabeth and Mr Pandit Nehru the first Prime Minister of Independent India.

I became a Petty Officer Steward and spent two years with Admiral Sir William Davis, looking after him and serving at his on-board dinner parties which included serving the Kings of Denmark and Norway and the Queen of the Netherlands.

On leaving the Navy I worked as a traditional butler in houses on large country estates, working for the Honourable Charles Cecil for 11 years.

Then, as a freelance butler/valet I looked after and served Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Margaret, Prince Charles, Princess Anne, the late Princess Diana and other members of the British and foreign royal families.
