Introduction:

Dresden's proximity to the Elbe River has made it a center for trade and culture both in historical and contemporary times. Since the 12th century, people have lived along the Elbe River, near present-day Dresden. During the 1700s, Dresden became the royal residence for the Electors of the Saxony, and in the 1800s, the city became the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony. For the Saxon court, the river not only provided natural beauty, but it connected the court with the rest of central Europe and provided them with a strategic location for launching military campaigns. Today, Dresden is one of the largest urban centers in eastern Germany, but visitors also love to take in the breath-taking views of Dresden along the Elbe River.

What makes this environment special or different?:

Dresden's environment is unique because the city is actually split into to parts by the Elbe River. The northern part, where I live, is called Neustadt and the southern part of Dresden on the other side of the river is called Altstadt. Within both the Neustadt and Altstadt sections of the city there are many smaller neighborhoods. Dresden is also very close to the SÃ¤chsische Schweiz National Park and the Elbe Sandstone Mountains, so many hikers often stop to sightsee in Dresden as well.
