Arriving on Xbox Live Arcade this Wednesday will be Petroglyph's turn-based strategy-collectible card game hybrid Panzer General: Allied Assault and a port of PC tower-building puzzler Tower Bloxx Deluxe, priced at 800 Microsoft Points ($10) apiece.

Spawn of the classic PC strategy series Panzer General, Allied Assault sports online multiplayer and such WW2 battles as Utah Beach, Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge. A board game is also in the works, due to arrive in January 2010.
