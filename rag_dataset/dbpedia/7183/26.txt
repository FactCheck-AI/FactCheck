Those wondering when Ubisoft was going to do something with the Panzer General rights need not wonder any longer. Panzer General: Allied Assault, an Xbox LIVE Arcade card game, will be launching this fall.

Petroglyph Games, the studio who created those Star Wars real-time strategy games and Universe at War, will be handling the development responsibilities. Now, if the words “card game” make you wince, it’s worth acknowledging that Allied Assault is just as much a board game as it is a videogame about card decks.

As a matter of fact, there are plans in motion to release a physical board game based on Panzer General: Allied Assault later this fall as well. I can’t speak from personal experience, but I know that the prior games were mostly met with critical acclaim. Let’s hope the trend continues.
