Pfizer, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, has a history that dates back to its founding in 1849 by cousins Charles Pfizer and Charles Erhart in Brooklyn, New York. The company initially focused on the production of chemicals, but it eventually became known for its innovations in the pharmaceutical industry. The company's brand is associated with a variety of pharmaceutical and healthcare products, and its logo is widely recognized in the medical and healthcare industries. The logo trademark featuring the word "Pfizer" was first registered on April 17, 1953.

Since its establishment, Pfizer has been involved in various trademark dispute, two notable examples include challenges related to its widely recognized drugs Lipitor and Viagra. After the expiration of Lipitor's patent, Pfizer faced legal battles to protect its brand against generic versions entering the market. Lawsuits were filed against companies producing generic atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor, asserting patent infringement. Similarly, as the patent for Viagra expired, Pfizer encountered legal disputes over generic versions of sildenafil, the drug's active ingredient. The company sought to defend its exclusive rights to the Viagra brand, engaging in legal actions against manufacturers producing and marketing generic sildenafil. In addition to its pharmaceuticals, Pfizer has also faced trademark challenges in the context of its pain-relief medication Celebrex. Legal conflicts arose as generic manufacturers sought to produce and market generic versions of Celebrex following the expiration of certain patents. These disputes centered around the protection of Pfizer's intellectual property rights related to the Celebrex brand.
