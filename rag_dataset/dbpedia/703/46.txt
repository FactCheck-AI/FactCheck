Paul Davis, a singer and songwriter whose soft rock hit “I Go Crazy” stayed on the charts for months after its release in 1977, died April 22 in Meridian, Miss. He was 60.

Paul Davis’ hits included “I Go Crazy,” “’65 Love Affair” and “Cool Night.”

Davis died of a heart attack in Meridian, the city where he grew up, cousin James Edwards said.

Davis’ other popular hits included “65 Love Affair;” “You’re Still New To Me,” a country duet with Marie Osmond; and “Ride ‘Em Cowboy.”

His 1977 album “Singer of Songs — Teller of Tales” featured the ballad “I Go Crazy.” The song slowly climbed the charts, peaking at No. 7 eight months after its release, according to Billboard’s Web site. The song stayed in the Top 100 for 40 weeks, according to Billboard — a record at the time for the magazine’s Hot 100 chart. The mark has since b een surpassed many times; the current record holder is LeAnn Rimes’ “How Do I Live,” which stayed on the Hot 100 for 69 weeks.

Davis spent part of his early career in Jackson at Malaco Records, company President Tommy Couch said.

Couch said Davis arrived at Malaco with his writing partner, George Soule, around 1968.

After Davis left Jackson, he moved to New York, Nashville and then back to Meridian.
