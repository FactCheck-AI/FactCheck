Paul Davis, 60, a singer and songwriter whose soft-rock hit “I Go Crazy” stayed at the top of the charts for weeks after its release in 1977, died of a heart attack Tuesday at Rush Foundation Hospital in his native Meridian, Miss., cousin James Edwards said.

Davis’ other hits included “ ’65 Love Affair,” “Cool Night,” “Ride ‘Em Cowboy” and country duets with Marie Osmond, including “You’re Still New To Me.”

His 1977 album “Singer of Songs -- Teller of Tales” featured the ballad “I Go Crazy.”

The song slowly climbed the charts, peaking at No. 7 eight months after its release, according to Billboard’s website. The song stayed in the top 100 for 40 more weeks, according to Billboard.

The son of a Methodist minister, Davis was born April 21, 1948, and raised in rural Mississippi.

He started his music career in Jackson, Miss., then worked in New York, Atlanta and Nashville before returning to Meridian to retire.
