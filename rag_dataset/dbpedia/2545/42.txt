Biography

ELISABETH DUHON, veuve AU COIN is on the Wall of Names at the Acadian Memorial in St. Martinville, Louisiana, on Plaque 11 Left, L'Amitie, arrivée le 7 novembre 1785. Listed with her are seven daughters: Anne Marie, Genevieve, Marie Magdeleine, Marie Felicite, Elisabeth, Anne Augustine and Marie Reyne.[1]

Marie Magdeleine Aucoin was born on January 8, 1768 at Belle-Isle-en-Mer, France, a daughter of exiled Acadians Alexandre Aucoin and Elisabeth Duon.[2] Marie had four younger and two older sisters; the firstborn was from their father's first marriage, to Marie Trahan, who died during le grand dérangement when their deportation ship was refused debarkation and they had to winter-over at the British colonial port of Virginia in 1756 before sailing on to England. Her father remarried while detained seven years in England. When they were freed in 1763, they were sent to France.

Thirty years after the deportations, Marie Magdeleine immigrated to Louisiana aboard l'Amitié with her widowed mother and six sisters in 1785. She was 17.[3][4]

On the day after their arrival in the port of New Orleans, Jean Baptiste Simon of Nantes, France, who had apparently stowed away aboard the ship to go with her, applied for a license to marry,[5] and they married five days later in New Orleans.[6]

They settled in St. Martin parish in southwest Louisiana and had nine known children.
