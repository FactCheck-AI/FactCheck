Join host, Carl Amari, for a radio re-broadcast of The Great Gildersleeve. Featuring narration from the legendary Harold "Hal" Peary.

Serving as a radio situation comedy from 1941 to 1958, did you know that The Great Gildersleeve was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs? The series was built around the character of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, who was a regular character from the hit radio situation comedy series, Fibber McGee and Molly. With Hal Peary taking on the role of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve after the transition from its parent show, the series saw eventual success, and had even spawned four feature films during the height of its popularity.

Originally airing 8/29/1945, come one and come all, as we gather around the radio for this week's episode of "Vacation at Grass Lake," with Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve!
