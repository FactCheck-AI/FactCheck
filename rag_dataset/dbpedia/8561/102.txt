The wide open skies here are sources of endless sketches and paintings, with a light that changes constantly, along with the weather. Skyscapes are a focus of much of Tania's art, along with the coast and the landscape of the Highlands of Scotland.

As a sea kayaker and adventurous spirit, Tania's artwork captures moments in time and back in her home studio, impressions are translated onto canvas. Her main love is the medium of oil and is often found painting plein air.

Tania trained as an archaeological illustrator and this influences her work with many lines, layers and detail.

Her work is available to buy at a variety of Scottish Galleries and commissions are undertaken on any scale.

Art brings her a sense of mindfulness and stillness, and is a joy to create and share. My paintings are fluid and I always try to convey the movement of nature. I often take photographs to work from back in the studio, and do intend to capture the essence of a place. Once the paints start to move from the palette, I will normally complete a painting before the oil is dry. I tend to leave a painting once I feel that the place that I visited is alive for another to appreciate.

Commissions are currently being taken for 2024
