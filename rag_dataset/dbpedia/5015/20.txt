During my study at the Utrecht University I saw Silicon Graphics (SGI) workstations for the first time.

When I started my own company, Castle Amber, back in 1994, I had plans to write software mainly for Silicon Graphics work stations. I wanted to buy an SGI Indy, but at that time the computer was way too expensive for a start up. The decision was made to buy a second hand Indigo R3000 instead. This SGI computer has been used for several years by me for web application development, using Perl, the Apache web server, mySQL and C.

A few years later I was able to buy more second hand SGI workstations: a few Indy workstations and even an O2.
