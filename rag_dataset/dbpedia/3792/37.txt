The United States Capitol remains one of the most popular tourist attractions in Washington. Yet many people may not know that the original architectural drawings of the Capitol were designed by a physician. A graduate of the University of Edinburgh, William Thornton (1759–1828), was practicing in Tortola, British West Indies, when he submitted his plan for the competition in 1793. President George Washington selected Thornton's plan for its "grandeur, simplicity and convenience." Dr. Thornton has the distinction of being the first Architect of the Capitol.

Inside the Capitol building, several statues are of particular interest to the health professions. The National Statuary Hall Collection dates back to 1864, when states were invited to provide two statues each of individuals who brought distinction to their home states. Of the 96 individuals honored in the Statuary Hall and adjacent corridors of the Capitol, the following are of special interest:

Father Damien (1840–1889), a Belgian priest who spent 16 years at the Molokai colony taking care of lepers and became a victim of leprosy himself (statue given by Hawaii)

John Gorrie (1802–1855), a physician whose interest in tropical diseases led to his invention of a machine to make artificial ice, which he patented (statue given by Florida)

Crawford W. Long (1815–1878), a country doctor who first used ether in surgery in 1842 (statue given by Georgia)

Ephraim McDowell (1771–1830), a country doctor who successfully removed an ovarian tumor in 1809 (statue given by Kentucky)

John McLoughlin (1784–1857), a Canadian physician who governed the Oregon territory (1824–1843) and became a US citizen in 1849 (statue given by Oregon)

Florence Sabin (1871–1953), a pioneer in science and public health, and first woman to become a full professor at a medical school, The Johns Hopkins University, (statue given by Colorado)

Marcus Whitman (1807–1847), a physician who is known for his medical missionary work among native Americans in Washington territory (statue given by Washington)

During the Civil War, the Capitol was used as a fort, barracks, bakery (producing 60,000 loaves a day), and hospital. Two thousand cots were were set up in the House and Senate chambers, and the Rotunda. The first group of wounded arrived from the Second Battle of Bull Run and later from Antietam in September 1862.

The world's largest museum complex, the Smithsonian Institution houses an impressive medical sciences collection. It dates from 1876, when about 600 crude drug specimens, displayed at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, were deposited in the U.S. National Museum. Since then it has grown into one of the largest collections of medical objects in the world, encompassing almost all fields of medicine and health care.

The medical sciences collection is a part of the National Museum of American History (14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW). Administered by the Division of Science, Medicine, and Society, the diverse collection includes patent medicines, drug-manufacturing apparatus and containers, biologicals, alternative medicines, laboratory equipment, eyeglasses, prosthetics and artificial organs, surgical instruments, dental equipment, microscopes, radiology and other body imaging devices, diagnostic instruments, quack medical devices, veterinary medicines, uniforms, public health materials, and biotechnology instrumentation. These are supplemented by trade catalogues, posters, advertising literature, business records, and audiovisual and manuscript materials.

Some of the earliest fauna and flora specimens at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History (10th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW) date from the 1850s. Federally sponsored expeditions such as the United States Mexican Boundary Survey (1848–1855), Pacific Railroad Survey (1853–1855), and Northwest Boundary Survey (1857–1861) had physician-naturalists accompanying the surveying teams. These expeditions produced large collections of animals and plants which were deposited at the Smithsonian. Many physician-naturalists, including Caleb B.R. Kennerly, James G.Cooper, George Suckley, Adolphus L. Heermann, and John S. Newberry, contributed to early collection building at the Smithsonian.

The historic Patent Office Building covers the entire block, defined by F and G Streets, and 7th and 9th Streets. Considered the third oldest federal buildingin Washington, it houses two art museums of the Smithsonian Institution, the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Designed in the Greek Revival style in the 1830s, the massive structure took over thirty years to complete. Many early government offices were located here. In the 1850s, Clara Barton worked here as a clerk to the Patent Commissioner, the first woman federal employee to receive equal pay. During the Civil War, the building was turned into military barracks, hospital, and morgue. Wounded soldiers lay on cots in third-floor galleries, among glass cases holding models of inventions that had been submitted with patent applications. The American poet Walt Whitman frequented the place and read to wounded men. The Patent Office continued to occupy the building until 1932. In 1958, United States Congress transferred the structure to the Smithsonian Institution for housing its art collections. After serving as home for American art for over three decades, the building closed for renovations in January 2000. Recently named the Donald Reynold W. Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture, the Patent Office Building reopened in July 2006 and is once again a part of the cultural life of Washington.

Ford's Theatre was the site of the tragic assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in April 1865. It was then closed as a theatre and remodelled. In 1867 it was taken over by the U.S. Army to house a cluster of important post-Civil War medical activities of the Army Surgeon General's Office. The most significant were: the archive of Civil War medical records, essential for verification of veterans' pension claims; the Army Medical Museum; the editorial offices for preparation of the multi-volume Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion; and the Library of the Surgeon General's Office. When the Army's needs outgrew the capacity of the former theater, several of the units were moved in 1887 to a new building, Army Medical Museum and Library, on the Mall.

The Ford's Theatre was restored to its 1865 appearance in the 1960s. The building is maintained by the National Park Service and houses the Lincoln Museum. In addition, it is a living theatre with regular performances. For additional information about the history of the Ford's Theatre, visit the website sponsored by the National Park Service.

In the above picture, the large building in the middle is the Ford's Theatre. The building with the mansard roof on the right, which was at the corner of E and 10th Streets, first housed the Medical Department of Columbia College (now George Washington University) and later the Medical Department of Georgetown University. The site is now occupied by Hard Rock Cafe, Washington, DC.

A Day That Changed American History

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the stretch of F Street from the Department of Treasury (just east of the White House) to 6th Street, NW, was a fashionable district of Washington. A few of the early medical establishments were also located here. Georgetown University Medical Department occupied a building next to the corner of F and 12th Streets from 1851 to 1868. The Medical Hall, the first headquarters of the Medical Society of the District of Columbia, was built in 1868 near the corner of F and 10th Streets. Dr. Robert King Stone (1822-1872), a prominent Washington physician, lived and maintained his office in a large house at the corner of F and 14th Streets. He was President Abraham Lincoln's doctor. The Children's Hospital operated in a 12-bed facility at F and 13th Streets from 1870 until 1879. A few years later, in 1884, the National Homeopathic Hospital was founded on F Street, between 11th and 12th Streets. Yet today, the tall business buildings and establishments such as Banana Republic, McDonald's and Popeyes that line F Street provide no clues as to the medical importance of the area in the 19th century.
