Welcome to our online tour of commemorative plaques celebrating the people and places associated with the BBC and its programmes.

In our interactive map we mark the history Britainâs black community, showing the plaques installed as part of David Olusogaâs 2016 landmark BBC TV series Black and British - A Forgotten History.

Broadcasting heritage plaques include some of the UKâs first ever radio stations, such as Glasgowâs BBC â5 SCâ, Cardiffâs â5 WAâ, and Belfastâs â2 BEâ stations, and there are new BBC blue plaques installed at former studios including: Bush House (BBC World Service), Maida Vale (BBC orchestras and BBC Radiophonic Workshop), and BBC Elstree Centre (Eastenders).

Further south at Asnelles in Calvados, weâve featured the Radio Londres plaque, located at the CimetiÃ¨re d'Asnelles. The plaque commemorates the solidarity of the BBC with the Free French, both in its broadcasts from London, and from 1944 its wartime broadcasting centre at ChÃ¢teau de Creully near Bayeux.

And, from each BBC English region we feature a BBC Music Day plaque. These were awarded in 2017 by BBC Local Radio stations to venues that hosted a landmark musical moment in their area. The range of musical talent featured is vast, from Led Zeppelinâs first appearance at Newcastleâs former Mayflower Ballroom, to The Bamboo Club which was the home of ska, reggae and bluebeat in Bristol.

Following the bombing of Broadcasting House in 1940, the East Block of this building was requisitioned, and the installation of a basic radio operation began for the BBC Overseas Service.

This was rapidly superseded by the superior all-electronic service created by EMI that had been running in parallel.

It is situated in central London between Oxford Street and Regents Park, adjacent to Nash's All Souls' church, and is Grade II* listed. The Architectural Review of 1932 described it as the 'new Tower of London', but it had a mixed reception amongst architects generally, being criticised as a conservative mix of functional elements with a nod toward Art Deco.

A BBC Heritage Trail plaque.

For more than 70 years the BBC's international voice was heard from the neo-classically styled Bush House, originally constructed in the 1920s as a trade centre. Having been bombed out of Broadcasting House in the early stages of the Second World War, BBC European Services, needed a new home. Bush House was massive in comparison to its former offices, and the BBC increased rapidly its number of foreign language services. The BBC left Bush House in 2012.

Radio 2âs Friday Night is Music Night was a regular fixture at the theatre, as well as series and one-offs from the BBC Concert Orchestra, the BBC Big Band and the BBC Radio Orchestra. By the mid-1970s this middle of the road fair was contrasting with concerts by the likes of AC/DC for BBC Radio 1. The BBC left in 2003.

Gaumont, Gainsborough Pictures and Rank Films occupied the site, and some of the greatest names of British cinema worked there, including Alfred Hitchcock.

Maida Vale - Delaware Road, London

Plaque inscription:

âHome of BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Radiophonic Workshop.â

A BBC Heritage Trail plaque.

Maida Vale was acquired in response to the rapidly increasing requirements of broadcasting in the early 1930s. Built in 1909, Maida Vale Studios were originally the home of the Maida Vale Roller Skating Palace and Club.

Since 1934 Maida Vale has housed some of the UKâs leading orchestras, and played host to thousands of popular musicians and artists. Right from the beginning Studio 1 has been home of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC Singers. Other BBC orchestras and popular dance bands have occupied Studios 2 and 3.

The BBC used it as a standby radio news service during the Second World War.

From the 1960s, jazz and pop music became a major feature of recordings and transmissions from Maida Vale. Many now famous artists launched their careers from the studios. Big names include: Glen Miller, Bing Crosby, Ronnie Scott, Lonnie Donegan, Cliff Richard and the Shadows, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Elton John, Queen, George Michael, Adele, and many more.
