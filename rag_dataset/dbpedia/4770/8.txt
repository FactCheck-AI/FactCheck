How would you write a function in ALGOL 58?

A function in ALGOL 58 is defined using the 'procedure' keyword, followed by the function name, parameters, and the function body. For example, 'procedure add(x, y); begin real result; result := x + y; return result; end;'.

What are the data types supported by ALGOL 58?

ALGOL 58 supports two main data types: real numbers and integers.

Describe the difference between ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60.

ALGOL 60 introduced several improvements over ALGOL 58, including the addition of 'for' loops, 'if-then-else' statements, and the removal of the 'own' keyword. ALGOL 60 also introduced the concept of 'call by name'.

How would you declare a variable in ALGOL 58?

In ALGOL 58, a variable is declared using the keyword 'real' or 'integer' followed by the variable name. For example, 'real x;' or 'integer count;'.

What are the main features of ALGOL 58?

ALGOL 58, also known as IAL, is characterized by its block structure, lexical scoping, recursion, and the separation of the language into two parts - the core language and the standard library.

Has the candidate shown problem-solving skills during the interview?

Problem-solving is a key skill for developers, as they will often need to find solutions to complex issues.

Can the candidate effectively debug ALGOL 58 code?

Debugging is a critical skill for any developer, and it's important that they can handle this in ALGOL 58.

Does the candidate have a solid understanding of ALGOL 58?

A strong understanding of ALGOL 58 is crucial as it's the primary language they will be working with.

How would you implement error handling in ALGOL 58?

ALGOL 58 does not have built-in support for exception handling. Error conditions would have to be checked and handled manually in the code.

Describe the difference between lexical and dynamic scoping in the context of ALGOL 58.

ALGOL 58 uses lexical scoping, which means that a variable's scope is determined by its position in the source code, and nested functions have access to variables declared in their outer scope. This is different from dynamic scoping, where a variable's scope is determined by the execution context.

How would you handle arrays in ALGOL 58?

Arrays in ALGOL 58 are declared using the 'array' keyword followed by the array dimensions. For example, 'array A[1:10];'. Elements can be accessed using their index, for example 'A[5]'.

What are the control structures available in ALGOL 58?

ALGOL 58 provides several control structures including 'if-then', 'go to', and 'while-do'.

How would you implement recursion in ALGOL 58?

Recursion in ALGOL 58 can be implemented by having a procedure call itself. For example, a recursive procedure to calculate factorial could be written as 'procedure factorial(n); begin if n = 0 then return 1; else return n * factorial(n - 1); end;'.

What are the key considerations when maintaining a legacy system written in ALGOL 58?

Key considerations would include understanding the original design and intent of the code, ensuring compatibility with modern systems, and dealing with the lack of support and resources for ALGOL 58.

How would you debug a program written in ALGOL 58?

Debugging an ALGOL 58 program would involve using a debugger that supports ALGOL 58, or using print statements to track the program's execution.

Describe the difference between pass by value and pass by name in the context of ALGOL 58.

In pass by value, the actual value of the argument is passed to the function, while in pass by name, a reference to the argument is passed. ALGOL 58 supports both, but pass by name was introduced in ALGOL 60.

How would you optimize a piece of code written in ALGOL 58?

Optimization in ALGOL 58 would involve techniques such as minimizing the use of expensive operations, reducing the number of function calls, and optimizing data structures and algorithms.

What are the limitations of ALGOL 58?

Some limitations of ALGOL 58 include lack of support for string manipulation, no built-in file I/O operations, and no support for exception handling.
