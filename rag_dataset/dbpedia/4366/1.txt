Standup comic.

Started out as a Pentecostal preacher--as was his father--and traveled all over the southern US'. doing tent-based revivals.

Interred at Memorial Park Cemetery, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. Memorial Park Cemetery is located 2 miles East of Interstate 44 (or 1.5 miles West of highway 169), at 51st St and Memorial Ave. Sam's burial site is next to his father and brother in Section 28 - Garden of the Apostles (Southeast quadrant), in the middle of the cemetery.

A long-time heavy drinker and drug user, he was (ironically) killed in a traffic accident by a drunk driver.

Was originally chosen to be Al Bundy on Married with Children (1986). He guest-starred as Al's guardian angel on Married with Children: It's a Bundyful Life Part 1 (1989), Married with Children: It's a Bundyful Life Part 2 (1989).

Was born on the same day as actress Kim Basinger.

His trademark scream "Ahh-ohhh-ahhh!" is sampled in Anthrax's recording of "I'm The Man".

He was a good friend of shock jock Howard Stern, who had written about his friendship with Sam as a tribute in his autobiography "Miss America", his follow-up to "Private Parts".

The long grey coat Kinison often wore early in his career actually belonged to Richard Widmark. Kinison was friends with Widmark's daughter and took the coat from his house.

Personal Quotes (4)

I don't worry about terrorism. I was married for two years.

[Joseph, dealing with the Virgin Birth] You better be the son of God, little mister - and you better be the only son of God.

You don't know what a rough crowd is. If all I have to do is go make people laugh, that's nothing. Let me tell you what a tough crowd is. A tough crowd is going to a morning service and you got six people there and you gotta pay your house payment. That's a tough crowd.

Every generation has someone who steps outside the norm and offers a voice for the unspeakable attitudes of that time. I represent everything that's supposed to be wrong, everything that's forbidden."
