Updates:

I added the 2005 census figures and areas of governorates.

ISO 3166-2 has come out in a second edition, dated 2007-12-15. This contains the ISO code for Mubarak Al-Kabir, as shown below.

FIPS 10-4 Change Notice 12, dated 2007-06-11, has FIPS codes for the new and changed governorates. The table has been updated accordingly.

The Europa World Year Book 2001 reports that a sixth governorate was created in 1999-11. Its name is Great Mubarak. No further details are provided. Other sources give its name as Mubarak Al-Kabir, and show that it was formed from the southern part of Hawalli. It was probably named for Sheikh Mubarak Al-Sabah, who ruled from 1896 to 1915.

I have acquired more recent census data for the governorates of Kuwait.
