St. John Church Foncha Street, Archdiocese of Bamenda, Cameroon was in a festive mood Friday April 19, 2019 as Christians, Priests and religious rallied around their Bishop, His Lordship, Michael Bibi, to celebrate 40 years of Priesthood for Rev Father John Bintum.

Rev Father John Bintum is of the first batch of Priests trained in the St. Thomas Aquinas Major Seminary, Bambui.

He was ordained by the Right Reverend Paul Verdzekov, Pioneer Archbishop of Bamenda of Blessed Memory, on 19 April 2079.

The Ruby Jubilee was full of color.
