Concerning the films "Take the Money and Run" (a 1969 American mockumentary comedy), "Manhattan" (a 1979 romantic comedy), and "Radio Days", (a 1987 American comedy-drama film), all of these films were directed by Woody Allen. Respectively, in the first film, Allen stars with Janet Margolin and the film chronicles the life of Virgil Starkwell (Allen), an inept bank robber. The second film has Allen co-starring with Diane Keaton. He is a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl. He will however fall in love with his best friend's mistress (Keaton). The third movie uses Allen to narrate as Joe. The film looks back on an American family's life during the 'Golden Age of Radio' using both music and memories to tell the story.

The 1972 movie "Play It Again, Sam" was not directed by Woody Allen. This comedy film was written by and stars Allen. Based on Allen's 1969 Broadway play of the same name, the film is directed by Herbert Ross, instead of Allen. It was astutely produced by Arthur P. Jacobs.

The film is about a recently divorced film critic, Allan Felix. He is urged to begin dating again by his best friend and his best friend's wife. Allan identifies with the movie "Casablanca" and the character Rick Blaine as played by Humphrey Bogart. The film is liberally sprinkled with clips from the movie and ghost-like appearances of Bogart (Jerry Lacy) giving advice on how to treat women.

This film was both a critical and commercial success.
