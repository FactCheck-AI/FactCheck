Midfielder ends speculation of a transfer to Spain

German midfielder Sebastian Kehl has committed his future to Borussia Dortmund for a further four years - ending speculation of a transfer to Spain. The 28-year-old international has signed a deal which will keep him at the Signal-Iduna-Park until 2012. Spanish sides Real Betis and Atletico Madrid were thought to be interested in the player, as were German giants Bayern Munich. But Kehl said only an extension to his contract or a move abroad were the possibilities, and he was happy to commit his future '100 per cent' to his present club. "They showed me really good sporting possibilities," he said. Welcoming the deal, the club's general manager Michael Zorc said that the defensively minded midfielder was 'a very important player' for their future.
