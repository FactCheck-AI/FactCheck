Even though it's couture week in Paris, Demi Moore and her sidekick, Pilaf, aren't taking in the latest collections like they should be. Instead, Moore is in New York City promoting her new show, Feud: Capote vs. The Swans, which hits FX on Jan. 31. She, along with her co-stars ChloÃ« Sevigny, Calista Flockhart, and Diane Lane are using the streets of the Big Apple as their own personal runways and Moore's Carolina Herrera skirt suit stole the spotlight. Moore pulled from the label's Spring-Summer 2024 collection, wearing a long, checkered coat and coordinating midi-length pencil skirt.

Of course, Pilaf is accompanying her on this press tour, and Moore dressed her pup in a simple black top to stave off the chill and to coordinate with the black layer that she wore with her 'fit. She finished the look with Malone Souliers cap-toed black-and-white mules, Wayfarer-style shades, and her signature raven hair parted in the middle.

Last year, Pilaf was Moore's permanent plus-one as she attended fashion shows in Italy. The two were spotted at Versace together as well as the Fendi show. Pilaf also makes regular appearances on her Instagram feed, so fans have plenty of reason to be jealous of the pint-sized puppy, whether it's the proximity to Moore or the global travel.

Moore plays Ann Woodward in the upcoming FX series, which follows Ryan Murphy's previous Feud limited series, Bette and Joan. Speaking to Town & Country, Moore said that she wasn't fully aware of the story behind Capote and the storied Swans of New York, which included Babe Paley, Lee Radziwill, and C.Z. Guest.
