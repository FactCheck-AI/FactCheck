Jeremy Slate, 80, the versatile actor who co-wrote and starred in the cult film “Hell’s Angels ‘69” and went on to appear in eight seasons of the daytime drama “One Life to Live,” died Sunday at UCLA Medical Center of complications after surgery for esophageal cancer, his agent, Bonnie Black, said.

Slate gained fame in the early 1960s on the TV series “The Aquanauts” and a few years later appeared alongside Elvis Presley in “Girls! Girls! Girls!”

He guest-starred on nearly 100 TV shows, including “Gunsmoke,” “Mission: Impossible,” “Bewitched” and “Police Story.” Most recently, he was seen in the NBC sitcom “My Name Is Earl.”

Often cast as a tough guy, Slate appeared during the late 1960s in a string of biker films, including “The Born Losers” and “Hell’s Angels ‘69,” which he co-wrote.

From 1979 to 1987, he was a regular on the ABC soap “One Life to Live” as Chuck Wilson, his longest-running role.
