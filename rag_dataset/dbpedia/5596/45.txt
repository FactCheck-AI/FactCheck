SUMMARY

Kirari Tsukishima may not have an interest in the entertainment industry or idols, but she's passionate about food and has no concern for love. She's thrown into a peculiar situation when she rescues a stranded turtle and meets the charming Seiji, who gifts her SHIPS concert tickets. Her excitement is short-lived when a stranger named Hiroto rips up her tickets and warns her to stay away from Seiji. Unperturbed, Kirari sneaks into the concert and discovers that Seiji is a member of SHIPS alongside his hostile friend Hiroto. Despite coming from vastly different worlds, Kirari is undeterred and decides to pursue her dream of becoming an idol like Seiji.
