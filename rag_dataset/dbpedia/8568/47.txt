Nobody knew television actor Santosh Shukla till he entered the Bigg Boss house this season. But, today he is a household name, thanks to his flirtatious nature and his incomplete love story with Aashka Goradia and Karishma Kotak. We spoke to this very man about his exit from the house and his future plans. Excerpts: “I was romantic and flirtatious in the house but this is how I am in my real life too. I fall in love just the way people catch cold. There have been times when I have been taken for a ride because of my nature, but then I can’t change this. I fell for Aashka and that is why I went ahead and proposed her. She used to go and say things about me in front of the camera, but never came up to me. Had she told me once that she has an issue with it, I would have stopped,” moaned Santosh. “Nirahua had warned me about it. He had told me that Aashka was using me but I did not believe in him then. In fact, just before we were to enter the actual house from the mud house, Aashka had asked me not to talk to certain people. But, soon she herself started talking to these very people. She had told me that Urvashi wasn’t a nice person but she was the most caring person in the house. She made haldi dudh for me while I was unwell, how can I forget that. Does that mean that this artiste is hurt with Aashka’s behavior? “I am terribly hurt and I would never want to see Aashka’s face ever again,” he concedes. Didn’t you do certain things in the house to grab the audience’s attention? “I am not Rajev Paul to take footage. He was the one who was insecure in the house and spoke badly about everybody.” So who do you think are playing games in the house? “Rajev, Delnaaz (Irani) and Sapna (Bhavnani). People think it’s Urvashi, but she is the Jhansi ki Rani; she says exactly what she feels,” Santosh observes. What about Karishma? “Yes, I proposed her before moving out of the house. I told her that if she ever wants someone who will live his life for her and settle with her in London, she can call me. So, yes I will be anxiously waiting for her call and if she doesn’t call me, I will keep a swayamvar,” he avers. Which reality show are you planning to take up next? “Khatron Ke Khiladi. But, before that Salman Bhai (Khan) has offered me a film. So, I will be busy with that,” Santosh reveals. Looks like someone has got the most out of this show.
