2nd Battalion 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment)

Researching Soldiers who Served in the Indian Army in the First World War

The 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) in the First World War

Lineage: Formed at Phillour in 1858 by Major J. C. Innes ”from the faithful remains of the 3rd, 36th and 61st Bengal Native Infantry, and designated ”The Loyal Purbiah Regiment”. In 1861 its designation changed twice, becoming first the 21st and then 17th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry. In 1864 it became the 17th (Loyal Purbiah) Regiment of Bengal Infantry and in 1898 the 17th (The Loyal) Bengal Infantry. In 1902 the Regiment became the 17th Musalman Rajput Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) and in 1903 the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment). The Regiment was disbanded on 20 December 1921.

Class Composition of Battalion in 1914: 8 Companies of Musalmans of the Eastern Punjab and Hindustan. 1919: 4 Companies of Musalmans of the Eastern Punjab and Hindustan.

Location in 1914: The 17th Infantry was stationed at Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh, India), having arrived from Manipur (India) on 12 March 1914.

The 17th Infantry was an Indian infantry regiment which served in East Africa and with the Egyptian Expeditionary Force during the First World War. In the Regiment’s final confidential report before the outbreak of war, the 17th Infantry was inspected by Major-General Alexander Wilson, Commanding Lucknow (Infantry) Brigade in 1914 and I’ve transcribed part of the report below:

Turnout: Satisfactory.

Efficiency in drill: Satisfactory.

Recruits: Satisfactory. Of prescribed classes.

Interior economy: Satisfactory. Due economy is practised in regard to clothing deductions.

General efficiency: Individuality and independence of action is encouraged. Officers both British and Indian are well up to the standard of their rank, in the practical handling of their men. A well trained battalion.

Observations by Major-General E. S. May, Commanding 8th (Lucknow) Division:

This battalion showed itself during the Dacca Concentration to be a soldierlike and useful body of men. They were as well trained as could be expected from the situation in which they had been placed during the period previous to the manoeuvres. There was considerable initiative amongst the officers and discipline was good. Fit for active service.

The 17th Infantry was stationed at Lucknow in August 1914 and landed in East Africa in December 1915. The Regiment served in East Africa until January 1918 when it arrived back in India at Karachi (Sindh, Pakistan) the next month. The best resource for learning more about the Regiment’s service in East Africa, where it was decimated by disease, is its war diaries which I have recorded below. In June 1918, while the 17th Infantry was stationed at Dinapore, the Regiment received orders to mobilize for service in the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. The Regiment landed at Suez, Egypt on 19 June 1918 and served in the closing stages of the Palestine Campaign. The 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment) was disbanded on 20 December 1921. Below is an extract from the October 1914, Indian Army List which recorded the British officers serving with the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment).

Further Sources for the 17th Infantry (The Loyal Regiment)

A good source of information for the Regiment and the British officers who served with it are its confidential reports held at the British Library: Confidential Reports on Regiments etc. These reports also contain the annual reports of the British officers serving with the 17th Infantry. However, when the Regiment was abroad only its Depot and the British officers serving with it were reported on. For information regarding the British and Indian officers who served with the 17th Infantry, the Indian Army List should be consulted.
