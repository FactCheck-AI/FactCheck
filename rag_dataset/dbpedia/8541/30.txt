General Notes: Obituary:

WARREN BYERS. FRANSON 67 years of Blue Springs, Missouri, formerly of the Rosalie, Nebraska area passed away Sunday, June 21, 2009, at the McKay- Dee Hospital in Ogden, Utah.

How to sum up the life of Warren Byers Franson ... The facts: He was born June 3, 1942, to Bennie and Chloe (Byers) Franson. He grew up on a farm in Rosalie, NE where he and his family would dream of owning flat land to farm rather than hills. He went to Rosalie High School and graduated in 1959. He could spend an entire afternoon talking about all the work he used to do on his car and how he and his buddies would race into town on the dirt roads. He loved cars and he loved to go fast.

He joined the US Navy in 1959 as a way to see the world. After his four year term, he gave college a try at the University of Montana, where he had aspirations of becoming a film producer. The daily routine of college wasn't for him and the call from the sea was too strong to ignore. In 1964, he re-enlisted in the Navy. He married Sharon Schwarten, from Emerson, NE, on December 29, 1966. Together, they had three children, two sons (Scott and Jason) and a daughter (Sara). By 1981, he and Sharon came to the realization that they were better at being friends and divorced, but remained close.

Once his term in the Navy was over, he went to work for AT&T Communications and reaped the benefits of early retirement. As a retiree, he was free to dabble in anything that interested him. He became interested in antiques and began scouting auctions and finding good buys that he could clean up and sell. He still loved his fast cars and would spend hours researching and enhancing his 1984 Ford Mustang, then his 1991 Ford Thunderbird, to his latest 1998 Lincoln Mark VIII.

He also spent a lot of his free time taking vacations. He has seen most of the world, from Japan to Australia to China to Europe to South America. His greatest traveling pleasures; however, took place in the great United States of America, and always with family. He spent many trips with his younger brother, David Franson, and his kids. Trips were always a family affair. Countless hours were spent on the open highway, heading west. Travel within the United States was almost always done by car. He fully believed that people who took airplanes missed so much of the beauty and history that our country had to offer. His final vacation was a trip to Rosalie, NE for his 50th high school reunion, then to Salt Lake City, UT for a reunion with his former Navy shipmates. The plan was to continue on to Brookings, OR, where he could sink his feet into the sand and smell the sweet Pacific Ocean air. He never made it to Brookings, OR. He passed away due to internal complications in Ogden, UT on June 21, 2009, surrounded by his kids and grandkids.

The facts of Warren Franson's life do not begin to describe him as a person. He was strong and faithful when it came to his dedication and love for his family and friends. He was stubborn and determined when it came to doing something he very much wanted. He was a pleasant and joyous surprise to everyone that met him. He spent a lot of his last three years in and out of hospitals and one of the most common remarks from the nurses and doctors were, "We just love him." Was it his sense of humor, his mannerisms, his truthfulness? It was all of those things that made him Warren.

He relished and thrived in laughter and being surrounded by his loved ones. Space and the final frontier fascinated him. Fast cars, planes and ships excited him. Good toe tappin' music thrilled him. Travel and new things intrigued him. Independence Day and other loud bangs and booms electrified him. Accomplishments of his family and friends radiated from him. He was always one to never let things get in the way of doing what he truly wanted to do. He lived his life to the fullest and he expected nothing less from those around him.

His brother, David Franson, his sons, Scott Franson and Jason Franson, his daughter, Sara Franson, his grandchildren, Shanell Patterson and Ethan Franson, his great-grandchild, Logan Patterson, and his countless number of friends will carry the memory of Warren in their hearts. When a Grateful Dead, Elvis Presley, or John Denver song plays on the radio, when a night sky is spotted with endless stars, or when a fireworks display illuminates the darkness and shatters the silence, be sure to smile and know that Warren would be doing the exact same thing. Rejoice in all of the wonders of the world, natural and man-made, surround yourself with family and friends, and do whatever you can to be happy with life.

45. Otto Joseph Triesch was born on 20 Sep 1922 in Yakima, Yakima County, Washington, died on 28 Nov 2010 in Kennewick, Benton County, Washington at age 88, and was buried on 2 Dec 2010 in Sunset Memorial Gardens, Richland, Benton County, Washington. The cause of his death was Cancer.

General Notes: The following was written by Otto's sister at his 85th birthday Party.

A little boy born in Yakima WA. to Joseph and Winnifred Triesch.was named Otto Joseph, born Sep 20th 1922 weighing in at 9 pounds. He had lots of dark hair becoming thick and curly in years to come. Then OOPS! He didn't need a comb.

The family lived on a farm in Benton City Wa for most of Otto's toddler years. About 1928 the family of three moved to Tacoma where Otto attended Holy Rosary School.

After Christmas one year he gathered all of the discarded Christmas trees and delivered them one by one back to the neighbors.

Always looking for something to do he and a friend once delivered his mom and dads love letters to the neighbors mail boxes.

Otto and his parents moved back to Benton City in the early 1930s where they raised asparagus, black angus cattle, grapes, alfalfa, chickens, pigs and fruit on their 60 acre farm. As a young adult, Otto worked beside his parents at various tasks. However he was never fond of the farm work.

When Otto was 17, his baby sister was born in Prosser on the hottest day ever recorded there on July 27, 1939 (114) degree. He always protected and watched over her however she was a little rascal to him. She would jump off of the barn onto his back when he was carrying buckets of milk to the house. Otto has no other brothers or sisters.

He has always been a kind and gentle man and has had many good friends throughout his long life.

He has never been married, has never inhaled cigarette smoke nor has he cussed or drank. He has survived numerous surgeries determined to keep going with a positive attitude (No wonder he lives to age 85)-just like the energizer bunny. He just keeps going and going.

The family farm was sold in 1952 making Otto very happy to move to town where he lived near his & grandmother and parents for many years. About 1959 he inherited a small house from his grandmother. Otto and his parents were once again living together. Otto's sister was married, living in Kennewick with her family. He would visit and enjoy being with his nieces and nephews. They call him "UNKIE."Scott told his mother he was about age 10 before he knew Otto had another name besides UNKIE. Unkie now has 8 great nieces and nephews and 2 great great nieces.

Otto's dad passed away June 1976, leaving Otto and his mother still living in Benton City.

When the Washington Street Dessert Villa Apt. was being built, Otto and his mother applied to move into one of the Apartments when completed. In the meantime they sold their home and moved in with Otto's sister and family waiting for the completion of the building. The steel strike delayed construction so the two families lived together for 18 months. Otto had a dog named Chris which he left with his sister to care for.

The day finally arrived and Otto and Winnifred Triesch moved into Apt 328-2 bedroom on So. Washington St. where they made many friends and both joined the Senior Citizens center becoming very involved in most activities. bingo, square dancing, pool, ceramics, dominoes, dards, exercise classes. Otto received a certificate for 28 years of volunteer service at the Senior Center. He belonged to the Kettle Scrappers, was in many parades. He played Santa Clause for many years. He always had many unique costumes for Halloween and enjoyed most of the activities. Helped deliver meals on wheels and served beverages and washed dishes at the Senior center noon meals. He loves to fish and travel. He had a pet Finch and asked his sister to care for it while he was visiting friends. He hasn't asked her to care for or any more of his things. He has always grown plants and flowers and planted a garden.

Otto's mother died in 1984, he moved into apt # 227- A (1) bedroom on South Washington. St. where he resided until most recently when he fell and broke his ankle. His doctor advised him to discontinue living alone. This decision was difficult, however Otto knew this was the best thing to do and agreed to leave Dessert Villa where he has lived for 29 years. He moved to the adult family home belonging to Denise and John Larson on 26th and Garfield in Kennewick during July 2007.

Today, many of Otto's friends, neighbors, relatives and special care providers are here to help him celebrate his 85th birthday.

We want to thank all of these special persons in Otto's life for taking him to decorate family graves, to Church and to many of the various activities he has been involved in over the many years. Bringing him goodies, looking after him when he was recuperating from surgeries, and unlocking his door when he was locked out. Taking him to various appointments. Taking him to Mariners games.( As you all probably know he is a big fan). Thanks for taking him to the fair and to the ocean as well as community events and dinners at your home.

Thank you for all of the phone calls, well wishes, visits and cards when he was in the hospital and Life care.

Thanks to all of you for the goodies here at the Potluck and thanks to all involved in helping us honor Otto on his special day

Happy Birthday Otto and many more!

In conclusion-thank you to the Monday night Bible study group for letting us use this room for this special party.

47. Otto Joseph Triesch was born on 20 Sep 1922 in Yakima, Yakima County, Washington, died on 28 Nov 2010 in Kennewick, Benton County, Washington at age 88, and was buried on 2 Dec 2010 in Sunset Memorial Gardens, Richland, Benton County, Washington. The cause of his death was Cancer.

General Notes: The following was written by Otto's sister at his 85th birthday Party.

A little boy born in Yakima WA. to Joseph and Winnifred Triesch.was named Otto Joseph, born Sep 20th 1922 weighing in at 9 pounds. He had lots of dark hair becoming thick and curly in years to come. Then OOPS! He didn't need a comb.

The family lived on a farm in Benton City Wa for most of Otto's toddler years. About 1928 the family of three moved to Tacoma where Otto attended Holy Rosary School.

After Christmas one year he gathered all of the discarded Christmas trees and delivered them one by one back to the neighbors.

Always looking for something to do he and a friend once delivered his mom and dads love letters to the neighbors mail boxes.

Otto and his parents moved back to Benton City in the early 1930s where they raised asparagus, black angus cattle, grapes, alfalfa, chickens, pigs and fruit on their 60 acre farm. As a young adult, Otto worked beside his parents at various tasks. However he was never fond of the farm work.

When Otto was 17, his baby sister was born in Prosser on the hottest day ever recorded there on July 27, 1939 (114) degree. He always protected and watched over her however she was a little rascal to him. She would jump off of the barn onto his back when he was carrying buckets of milk to the house. Otto has no other brothers or sisters.

He has always been a kind and gentle man and has had many good friends throughout his long life.

He has never been married, has never inhaled cigarette smoke nor has he cussed or drank. He has survived numerous surgeries determined to keep going with a positive attitude (No wonder he lives to age 85)-just like the energizer bunny. He just keeps going and going.

The family farm was sold in 1952 making Otto very happy to move to town where he lived near his & grandmother and parents for many years. About 1959 he inherited a small house from his grandmother. Otto and his parents were once again living together. Otto's sister was married, living in Kennewick with her family. He would visit and enjoy being with his nieces and nephews. They call him "UNKIE."Scott told his mother he was about age 10 before he knew Otto had another name besides UNKIE. Unkie now has 8 great nieces and nephews and 2 great great nieces.

Otto's dad passed away June 1976, leaving Otto and his mother still living in Benton City.

When the Washington Street Dessert Villa Apt. was being built, Otto and his mother applied to move into one of the Apartments when completed. In the meantime they sold their home and moved in with Otto's sister and family waiting for the completion of the building. The steel strike delayed construction so the two families lived together for 18 months. Otto had a dog named Chris which he left with his sister to care for.

The day finally arrived and Otto and Winnifred Triesch moved into Apt 328-2 bedroom on So. Washington St. where they made many friends and both joined the Senior Citizens center becoming very involved in most activities. bingo, square dancing, pool, ceramics, dominoes, dards, exercise classes.
