raymond edwin rogers, dds

Raymond Edwin (Ray) Rogers passed away on Wednesday, May 28, 1997. The world lost a special man.

He loved his wife and companion, Judy. They celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary in December. He loved his children, Karen Rogers Holley of Kennesaw, GA., Patricia Rogers Robertson, of Marietta, GA., and David A. Rogers, of Woodstock, GA. He adored his grandchildren, Sarabrynn, Robby, Josh, Julia, and Caitlin and thrived in the role of the grandfather.

He achieved mastery in all his interests, fully dedicating himself to each endeavor. After retiring from a full, successful career in dentistry, he embarked on a second career as a consultant to the recreational scuba diving industry. He invented The Wheel, a safer and more practical alternative to the then existing decompression tables, which is presently marketed internationally.

He was a visionary and a perfectionist. He questioned everything and continually pursued better ways of doing things, anything. He had the rare ability to convert his ideas into realities.

He loved to sail, to ski, and to scuba dive. He loved to travel. He loved knowledge and he loved to share it with others.. He loved to use his hands to make things. He loved his home, one which he designed with his wife and built for his children and grandchildren. He loved his life and lived it fully!

He is our hero. He will be missed more than words can say.

Memorial services were held Saturday, May 31, 1997 at 11 a.m. with the Reverend Lee Ann Rogers Scarbrough, from the chapel of Cochran Funeral Home.
