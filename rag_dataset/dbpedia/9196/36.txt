The correct option is B Gulbarga (Kalaburagi)

Daulatabad, or Devagiri was the first capital of the Bahmani Kingdom. In two years, Alauddin shifted his capital to Gulbarga (also known as Kalaburagi). Later, his successors found it difficult to manage the stable kingdom even around Gulbarga. So they shifted the capital to Bidar in 1429.
