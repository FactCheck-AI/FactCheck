Peter Grange has been appointed Chief Marketing Officer at RAW Capital Partners as the company gears up for major growth in the coming years.

RAW Capital Partners doubled in size in 2023, now employing over 40 members of staff in Guernsey, Southampton, and London. Peter joins the businesses as it looks to grow the RAW Mortgage Fund from £200 million to more than £1 billion in the coming years.

Peter has 25 years’ experience working within agencies and in-house for renowned financial services firms as well as innovative fintech scale-ups. He recently returned to Guernsey after two years in London where he worked as Head of Marketing at Shojin, a UK property investment platform scale-up with investors from over 50 countries.

Prior to that, Peter was the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of a creative agency called Oi, which had over 45 staff across four locations – Guernsey, Jersey, UK, and Philippines. He sold the agency in 2021 after 17 years.

Some of Peter's most notable achievements include growing Collins Stewart Wealth Management (now Canaccord Genuity) from £4 billion to £10 billion assets under management (AUM). He also helped HSBC International increase market share for their credit card, deposit and mortgage products around the world.

Ben Nichols, Interim Managing Director of RAW Capital Partners, said: “We’re delighted that Peter has joined the team at RAW Capital Partners and we’re looking forward to benefitting from his expertise and experience as we continue to grow our business.”

Peter added: “I love everything about RAW Capital Partners - their vision, mission, values, energy, ambition, innovative culture, products, services and ESG policy. I’m excited to have joined this rapidly growing business and am keen to contribute to the growth of the brand, raising awareness of the RAW Capital Partners offering among investors, brokers and borrowers internationally.”
