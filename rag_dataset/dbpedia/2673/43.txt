The perfect matinee for those slowly darkening, chillier afternoons. The Lavender Hill Mob is probably my favourite of the Ealing comedies and I don't think anyone puts a foot wrong in it. The performances from the whole cast are spirited and TEB Clarke's screenplay is one of his best, as evinced by the Best Actor Oscar nomination for Alec Guinness and Clarke winning the Oscar for Best Screenplay respectively.

As is often the case with Ealing, The Lavender Hill Mob depicts Guinness and Stanley Holloway's 'little men' or underdogs gently defying the conformity of the establishment, in this case pulling off the perfect heist a million pound bullion robbery, leaving Guinness' employers at the Bank and the police with egg on their faces. As is customery for the era, at first glance you might think that Clarke concludes his story with the moral lesson of how crime doesn't pay, but on closer inspection he too is defying conformity; it is the two amatuer criminals, Guinness and Holloway, who face justice. The professional small time crooks of the gang, Sid James and Alfie Bass, evade capture completely. Further example of Clarke's mischievous spirit can be found in him gently sending up the thrilling manhunt finale that he personally wrote for Ealing's The Blue Lamp from a year earlier.

From a personal perspective, The Lavender Hill Mob remains as fresh and as funny today as it was when my dad first sat me down to watch it in the 1980s. In fact, I'd wager it is as fresh and as funny now as it was on its release in 1951. And it's barely eighty minutes long - perfect!
