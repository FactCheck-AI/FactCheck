I went with basically no expectations for this movie, and was surprised how good it was. The first half of the movie is power packed and the second half is OK OK. the main hero did a very good job, I am sure he started a new trend in Punjab with his cloth style..Its been long time since a Hero who got the whole package is seen on the screen, and this Hero sure knows his moves.

Rest of the crew did their job very well...this movie is a Must see for both Punjabi and non-Punjabi.

The songs are very catchy and sure they are a big hit in Punjab ..this movie is pure Paisa Wasool..Enjoy it :)
