We, in partnership with the Polo Puck Pirates Underwater Hockey Club and and a few selected Philippine Team Players, are inviting you all to join us as we conduct an Introduction to Underwater Hockey! ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

Underwater Hockey is a team sport between two opposing teams and is played while breath-holding underwater in a 6 to 8ft deep swimming pool. The objective of the sport is simple, itâ€™s to advance and move the puck into the opponentâ€™s goal. The team who scores the most goals win! ðŸ¥…

This event is absolutely open to everyone who loves to dive and play underwater! This is for water-enthusiasts who are looking for a unique new sport to play. Non-swimmers are absolutely welcome to join here however you must be confident in the deep pools (6ft-7ft). Donâ€™t worry as we will be using fins, masks, and snorkels, to help you swim easier.

Swimtravel Skindivers are encouraged to join. Practice your duck diving and breath-holding techniques here. Our goal is just to propagate the sport to everyone ðŸ˜‰
