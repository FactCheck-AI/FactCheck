Historical note:

The First Light Infantry Company was formed in 1818 as a state militia company based in Providence, R.I., and was affiliated with the Second Regiment of the Rhode Island militia. It became the First Light Infantry Regiment in 1863. In 1879, Infantry Hall was built by the regiment's Infantry Building Association on South Main Street. When this building was torn down in 1952, a time capsule was found in the cornerstone, the contents of which have been added to this collection.

Like most militia units, the regiment never saw active duty, and frequently resembled a social club more than a military regiment. However, it did play an important role in providing trained soldiers when circumstances required. It helped suppress the Olney's Lane riots in 1831, and the Dorr Rebellion in 1842. Many of its members served in the Civil War in Companies C and D of the First Regiment, Rhode Island Detached Militia. Similarly, many of its members served in the Spanish-American War in 1898.
