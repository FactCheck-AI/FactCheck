Ex-England International Coaches On Fantastic First Day At Old Wimbledonians

On Monday, Lions Sports Academy had the privilege of Ex England & Harlequins No.8 Tony Diprose coming along to help coach at the first day of our camp at Wimbledonian Warriors. It was a brilliant day and it was great to have the expertise of Tony along to help coach and provide unlimited advice to the children throughout the day.

With Tony having played professional rugby for over a decade for both England, Saracens & Harlequins, and then been part of the Harlequins coaching set up for another decade until the end of the 2018/19 season, he is someone who has an abundency of rugby knowledge and experience to be able to show children what they should be doing to help develop their core rugby skills and to consistently work on them.

Tony was able to help the children with improving their key skills such as communication around the pitch & their ability to react to out of the box situations that might occur in matches. This helped the children to develop their decision making & ability to react in pressurised situations.

It was fantastic to have Tony along to help coach the children and we are delighted that he will be returning to help us with the first day of our Prepare for Contact camp at Guildford RFC on 2nd September.

Lions CEO Andy Jones, who accompanied Tony on Monday, said " It was brilliant for everyone at Lions Sports Academy and Wimbledonian Warriors to be given the opportunity to have Tony Diprose come along and coach for the day on one of our camps. Just by having Tony along for the day, it helps to raise the quality of skill and atmosphere amongst the children. We are delighted that he will also be joining us at Guildford RFC in a few weeks and we hope there will be as many people there as possible to witness his coaching"
