Harlequins Legend To Attend Summer Camps

Lions Sports Academy are delighted to announce that Ex-England, Harlequins & Saracens No.8 Tony Diprose will be making an appearance on our upcoming summer camps at Old Wimbledonians & Guildford RFC on 19th August & 2nd September, to help give advice and coaching tips to all the boys and girls on camp.

Tony started his career at Saracens and earned 10 caps for England in the late 1990s, captaining the team once during England’s tour to Australia in June 1998. By 2001, Tony decided to leave Saracens & transferred to Harlequins, where he remained until his retirement in 2005. He decided to take up coaching, and soon transitioned into the Harlequins backroom staff, a place he would be familiar with until he left the club at the end of the 2018/19 season.

It is fantastic that we have been given the opportunity to have Tony come along to one of our camps and be able to exert his knowledge of the game upon both the children and our coaches too. Tony will help out with the coaching and look to help the children with their decision making, as well as getting them involved in game sense type activities that will centre around attacking and capitalising on open space.

Lions CEO & Founder Andy Jones, commented “We are extremely honoured & privileged to be able to have someone of Tony’s stature come along to our summer camps. Everyone associated with Lions is excited to meet him and be able to see the level of coaching experience that he can exert onto the children during his visit!”

We look forward to seeing Tony at both of our camps and hope that as many of you will come down and join in the sessions with him!
