Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television sitcom series The Simpsons. She is the middle child of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Klasky Csupo studio was given the opportunity to produce and animate a new series of one-minute cartoons which featured a family called 'The Simpsons', created by Matt Groening. Klasky Csupo produced and animated all 48 shorts (season 1-4), and when it became one of the most popular segments on the show, Fox began airing a weekly half-hour series entitled 'The Simpsons'. Klasky Csupo also conceived the idea of The Simpsons characters having yellow skin, and Marge Simpson having blue hair. Film Roman (founded by Phil Roman) continued the 20th Century Fox show 'The Simpsons', from season 4 to season 28.
