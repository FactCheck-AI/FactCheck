Carlyle Group, Providence Equity Partners and GMT Communications Partners announced Tuesday that they had signed a deal to sell Dutch cable company Casema to private equity groups Cinven and Warburg Pincus in a deal worth 2.1 billion euros (2.6 billion dollars).

Casema is the third-biggest cable operator in the Netherlands, with 1.3 million television subscribers, 400,000 broadband Internet and 136,000 telephony subscribers.

It specializes in so-called triple-play services combining television, telephone and internet subscriptions over cable.

Since 2002, Casema sales have increased by 10 percent and the number of its employees has increased from 750 in that year to 1,050 today, Carlyle said in a statement.
