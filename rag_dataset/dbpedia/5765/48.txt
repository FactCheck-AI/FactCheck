Singer Natalie Cole has slammed the decision to award Amy Winehouse with five Grammy Awards, claiming that it is rewarding her bad behaviour.

Cole, a Grammy Award winner herself who admitted to using the drugs LSD, heroin and cocaine in her 2000 autobiography, said that Winehouse did not deserve the honours.

“I don’t think she should have won,” Cole, the daughter of legendary singer Nat King Cole, told People magazine. “It sends a bad message to young people trying to get into this business, trying to do it right and keep themselves together.

“We have to stop rewarding bad behaviour,” she continued. “I think she is gifted, her performance was fine. I just feel she’s stepping into a place she hasn’t earned yet.

“She could die. This isn’t something that’s cute and fun to throw around in the press. Those of us who have been in the business long enough know the sacrifice it takes. You don’t just get to do your drugs and go onstage and get rewarded.”
