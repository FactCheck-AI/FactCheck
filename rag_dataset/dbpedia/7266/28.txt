The physicist Dr. Yoshio Nishina, who was from Satosho-cho twon, lived in this house during his childhood.

The house is estimated to have been built during the late Edo period, and it is one of the few Shoya (village headman) residences that exist today.

Dr. Nishinaâ€™s own calligraphy and letters are exhibited here.
