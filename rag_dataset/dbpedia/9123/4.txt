Beijing, also known as Peking, is the capital of China and one of the most populous cities in the world. It is the country’s political, educational, and cultural center, housing the headquarters of most of China’s largest state-owned companies. It is a significant hub for the national highway, expressway, railway, and high-speed rail networks.

Beijing is renowned for its opulent palaces, temples, parks, gardens, tombs, walls, and gates, and its art treasures and universities have made it a center of culture and art in China. The city is well-known for its numerous landmarks.

Where is Beijing?

Beijing is located in the northeastern part of the People’s Republic of China, near the coastal region that borders the Bohai Sea. This location puts it at the northern tip of the North China Plain, which the Yan Mountains bound to the north and the Taihang Mountains to the west.

The city is mainly flat, made up of fertile plains, but the geography becomes more mountainous on the outskirts with the Western Hills, known for their scenic beauty.

History of Beijing

Beijing’s history stretches back over three millennia and has served as the capital of multiple dynasties, playing a significant role in the cultural, political, and social development of China.

Signs of human life in Beijing trace back to prehistoric periods. The Peking Man site in Zhoukoudian, which provided evidence of a hominid species inhabiting the area around 750,000 years ago, was a significant archaeological find.

In recorded history, Beijing first rose to prominence as Ji, a city-state during the Western Zhou period (1045 BC to 771 BC). The city gained further importance when it became the capital of the State of Yan under the name Yanjing, one of the central states during the Warring States period (475-221 BC).

In 1271, Beijing was chosen as the capital of the Yuan Dynasty by Kublai Khan and was known as Dadu or “Great Capital.” The city was laid out in a grid pattern that remains today in the layout of Beijing’s streets.

After the fall of the Yuan, the Ming Dynasty moved the capital to Nanjing in 1368, but it was pushed back to Beijing in 1421 by the Yongle Emperor, and the Forbidden City was completed in 1420. Since then, Beijing has been China’s capital for most of the last six centuries, with some interruptions.

The city remained the capital during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), and it witnessed significant events, including the Boxer Rebellion in 1900.

In the 20th century, despite tumultuous events, including the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the Japanese occupation during World War II, and the Chinese Civil War, Beijing retained its status as the national capital.

In 1949, the People’s Republic of China was founded by the Chinese Communist Party, with Beijing as its capital. The city underwent large-scale modernization projects under the communist regime, transforming into a central hub for commerce and industry.

Beijing was the site of the infamous Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, an event that marked a significant moment in the city’s modern history. It also hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2022 Winter Olympics, cementing its position on the global stage.

Throughout its history, Beijing has preserved its historical and cultural sites, such as the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Temple of Heaven, and the Summer Palace, which stand as testaments to its rich historical legacy.

An ancient imperial garden northwest of the Forbidden City, Beihai Park offers lush landscapes, tranquil lake views, and historic temples. It’s known for the white pagoda on an island in the lake, providing a peaceful oasis in the bustling city.

The park is home to one of the three famous Nine-Dragon Screens in China. This glazed tile screen features nine different dragons playing with pearls against a backdrop of clouds and sea waves.

The central Beihai (North Sea) Lake served as a model for many famous classical gardens in southern China. For example, the garden designer of the Suzhou Gardens first visited Beihai Park before building the gardens in Suzhou.

It’s one of the most important cultural landmarks in China and a symbol of its growing influence in the global arts scene.

This impressive structure, designed by French architect Paul Andreu, is surrounded by a man-made lake and appears to float on water, creating a mesmerizing image. The titanium-accented glass dome is not only an architectural wonder, but it’s also designed for acoustics and reflects the sky, giving it a magical appeal.

Taking a boat ride on Qianhai Lake is a delightful experience and a great way to enjoy a different perspective of Beijing. Qianhai Lake is part of Shichahai, an area in Beijing known for its historic hutongs, old courtyard houses, and beautiful lakes.

In the daytime, you can enjoy the tranquility of the lake, admiring the willow-lined shores, historical buildings, and traditional Chinese-style boats. The area is also rich in history, having served as a royal waterway in the Yuan dynasty and later becoming a commercial district with many famous shops and restaurants.

If you choose an evening boat ride, you will see the lake come alive with the lights of nearby bars, restaurants, and teahouses reflecting on the water. The vibrant nightlife scene around the lake adds a different charm to the experience.

13. Visit Jingshan Park

Jingshan Park, or “Prospect Hill,” is a beautiful and historically significant park located in the heart of Beijing, just north of the Forbidden City. This imperial garden was transformed into a public park in 1928 and has since been a favorite destination for locals and tourists.

The park is renowned for its artificial hill, Jingshan, made from the soil excavated to build the moat of the Forbidden City. Standing at the top of this hill, you’ll be treated to a stunning panoramic view of the Forbidden City to the south and the rest of Beijing in all other directions.
