Oh, wow. Can't say this is a gigantic surprise, but still, it's significant. I remember how floored I was watching her set in college. Shes gone on todo so many great things. Congratulations and best wishes, and buon viaggio.

That's the Stanford connection. Josh Childress is former Stanford basketball player.

This is kind of sad. How do you retire from a sport you've literally played your entire like. I wonder how hard of a decision it was for her?

Interesting how just 4 days ago she said she was going to take some time off but was not retiring

The Leland native said she won’t use the term “retire,” because that’s too permanent.

“I’m not going overseas anymore, and I’m putting everything on hold,” Glass said.

Is it possible that Google translate is more literally translating, than by intent? Internet translating stinks, s perhaps she is just taking a break.

For example, in Spanish aDios is goodbye. Sure, that could be interpreted as retirement.

I have been one of her toughest critics at times but she did an amazing job. An elite setter and a great defender. It will be weird not seeing Glass set for the red, white and blue. This makes sense though. Starting a family is in the books for her maybe she will make a return to the game later. Only one Olympics though this seems premature. I wish she would stay on. I wish her and her family the best going forward though.

Agreed with the google translate, it makes most other languages sound like a child is speaking and I was wondering the same thing about her actual intent given her other statements about just taking time off

For some reason, Google Translate does not translate Italian > English very well. It does much better with other languages, such as German and Russian.

What Stanford connection? Alisha Glass played at Penn State.

Looking over their respective bios in Wikipedia, can't figure out where and how they met. I guess these days, you can meet in cyberspace via Twitter, Facebook, reddit, or Instagram and just text "Yo, want to hang out later?"

BTW, I had Josh Childress on my team in my NBA2k franchise and I could NEVER figure out his jump shot release point. He had such an idiosyncratic technique.

Surprised by this decision...but I wish her well in her future plans.

Is this gonna hurt Team USA leading up to Tokyo? I think we have around 4 very capable setters who can get the job done. Lloyd will be a frontrunner in that starting spot, with Kreklow, Hancock and Carlini.
