Omaha attorney Brian C. Buescher was sworn-in as a federal judge last Wednesday morning.

President Donald Trump issued Buescher’s commission last Tuesday, and Buescher was given the oath of office the next morning.

“Congratulations, and welcome to the Court family, Judge Buescher!” Chief Judge John M. Gerrard said in an email.

Buescher was nominated to the U.S. District Court of the District of Nebraska in November, and the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment on July 24.

“It is a tremendous honor to serve on the bench for the District of Nebraska,” Buescher said upon his Senate confirmation.

A formal investiture ceremony is planned for a later date.

Buescher had worked in private practice for 19 years at Kutak Rock’s Omaha office, where he leads the firm’s agribusiness litigation team and represented local and national clients in general commercial litigation. He is a graduate of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and earned his law degree from the Georgetown University Law Center.

Buescher has experience in a variety of areas, including agribusiness, environmental, food law, real estate, product liability, class action, banking and insurance bad faith litigation.

Buescher’s spot on the federal bench was created by Judge Laurie Smith Camp’s transition to senior status last year. Gerrard said previously that he appreciated the state’s senators for supporting the court.
