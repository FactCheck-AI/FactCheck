She recently celebrated her 49th birthday.

But Salma Hayek surely made women half her age envious of her evergreen looks on her latest outing.

The beautiful Mexican-American actress scintillated as she hit the red carpet in a low-cut dress at the premiere of her flick Septembers of Shiraz on Tuesday night.

She proudly put her cleavage on full display in the ruby-coloured midi dress at the event as part of the Toronto International Film Festival.

Salma looked absolutely stunning in a bright red dress featuring a low V-neckline and a beaded detailing around the neckline and sleeves of the frock.

The Frida actress teamed the look with a pair of strappy black heels and accessorised with a large ring featuring a big onyx stone on one hand and blinged out ring on the other.

She had her brunette locks worn down flowing over her shoulders as she sported natural, complimentary make-up on her face with a swipe of shiny nude lip.

It was a big night as she both stars and serves as executive producer for the drama.

She was joined by her co-star Adrian Brody at the event who gave her a sweet cuddle from behind as they posed for a cute shot together.

The 42-year-old Oscar-winning actress rocked a checked black suit over a crisp, white dress shirt along with a skinny black tie.

Gerard Butler, who is a producer of the flick, was also at the event as he wore a black three-piece suit over a light blue dress shirt with a black tie and blue leather dress shoes.

The film is based off a 2008 book written by Dalia Sofer, which takes place in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution.

Septembers Of Shiraz also stars Gabriella Wright, Shohreh Aghdashloo, Alon Aboutboul, Bashar Rahal and Anthony Azizi.

Aside from her movie commitments, Salma has appeared in a new video for Global Citizen, calling on Prime Minister David Cameron and President Francois Hollande to take action and accept more refugees in the UK and France.
