A report into controversial plans to build a school on a former toxic dump in a north Wales town claims children's health may be put at risk if it goes ahead.

The investigation was commissioned by parents who are opposed to Conwy Council's plans to relocate Llandudno's Ysgol John Bright to the town's former Maesdu Road tip site.

The local authority plans a Â£25m replacement for the campus whose old and crumbling buildings are barely fit for use.

But the chosen site is a former waste dump with buried toxic chemicals and heavy metals.

An expert report commissioned by opponents of the scheme said the new school could be built safely, but it questions whether the plans to remove the toxic materials are up to scratch.

It warns of a significant potential health risks.

However, Conwy council - which has Welsh Assembly Government approval for a public finance initiative to fund the new school by selling the existing site to a supermarket chain - is standing by its plans.

A spokesman said sufficient risk assessments have been carried out.

'Severe reservations'

Assembly Environment Minister Sue Essex is expected to rule this week on an appeal to revoke planning permission for the project.

Local AM Gareth Jones and the Children's Commissioner for Wales, Peter Clarke, have both expressed severe reservations about the site.
