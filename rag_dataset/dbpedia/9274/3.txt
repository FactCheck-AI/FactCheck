A secondary school has been forced to close for the day due to flooding. The closure affects pupils at Ysgol John Bright in Llandudno.

It is unclear how long the 1,147-pupil school on Maesdu Road will be closed for. Conwy County Borough Council has said it will issue an update once it has more information.

The school said on its Ysgol John Bright Facebook page at about 8am: "SCHOOL IS CLOSED TO STUDENTS TODAY. Unfortunately due to flooding in the school building overnight, the school will be closed to students all day on the grounds of health and safety.

"We apologise for the inconvenience and we will update you later today when we know more and have had time to fully assess the situation." Ysgol John Bright was on a site on Oxford Road in the town from 1907 to 2004.

Then that land was used for an Asda store and the school was rebuilt in its present location, opening in September 2004 in a private finance initiative.
