MEDIAN AGE INCREASED TO 34

Population pyramids are defined as graphics that show the changes in the age and gender structure of the population. When comparing Turkey's population pyramids for 2007 and 2023, it was observed that the elderly population increased and the median age increased due to the decrease in fertility and mortality rates.

The median age represents the age of the person in the middle when the ages of the people making up the population, from newborns to the oldest, are sorted from smallest to largest. The median age is also an important indicator used in interpreting the age structure of the population.

Turkey's median age, which was 33.5 in 2022, increased to 34 in 2023. When examined by gender, it was observed that the median age increased from 32.8 to 33.2 for men and from 34.2 to 34.7 for women.
