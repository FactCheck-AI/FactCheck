The Germanic-Saxon Kingdom of Hohenstein-Ernstthal is a massive, genial nation, ruled by King Eric II with an even hand, and renowned for its public floggings, irreverence towards religion, and devotion to social welfare. The compassionate, hard-working population of 2.879 billion Hohensteiners have some civil rights, but not too many, enjoy the freedom to spend their money however they like, to a point, and take part in free and open elections, although not too often.

The medium-sized government juggles the competing demands of Education, Administration, and Welfare. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of Hohenstein city. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 36.7%.

The thriving Hohensteiner economy, worth 231 trillion Vereinsthalers a year, is broadly diversified and led by the Tourism industry, with major contributions from Information Technology, Book Publishing, and Furniture Restoration. Average income is 80,404 Vereinsthalers, but there is an enormous disparity between incomes, with the richest 10% of citizens earning 476,022 per year while the poor average 6,267, a ratio of 76.0 to 1.

The Hohenstein-Ernstthal Enquirer offers weekly cash prizes for 'most blasphemous song, story, or cartoon', bike rage is all the rage, the new Refuse Hills housing development is under construction, and there's an aura of pseudoscience around academia. Crime, especially youth-related, is relatively low. Hohenstein-Ernstthal's national animal is the Horse, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its national religion is The United Lutheran Church.
