Summary

Brian Duffy (1933-2010) was one of the leading London fashion photographers of the 1960s. He was brought up in an Irish Catholic family in the East End, and went on to study fashion design at St Martinâs School of Art. His career in fashion led him to become an illustrator for Harperâs Bazaar, and he took up photography in the mid 1950s. In 1957 he joined the staff of Vogue, becoming friends with the photographers David Bailey and Terence Donovan. These three redefined the role of the fashion photographer, taking an energetic approach which was in tune with the new generation.

Duffyâs most influential work as a fashion photographer was done in the first half of the 1960s, when he developed an approach which mixed street photography with close-cropped compositions and exaggerated angles. He worked for a range of magazines during this time, including Elle and Queen as well as Vogue.

During the late 1960s and 1970s, he produced a number of important advertising campaigns, including the famous Benson and Hedges cigarette advertisements for Collett Dickinson Pearce. Becoming gradually disillusioned with the profession, he attempted to burn all of his negatives in 1979, then disappeared from public view. The relatively few surviving negatives were rediscovered by his son Chris in 2007, and are the source of these new prints.

This print exemplifies the energy and dynamism of Duffyâs style. It shows a young couple in the fashionable car of the day, the new E-Type Jaguar, on the M1, a newly-completed symbol of Britainâs resurgent economy and bright future. The shiny modernity of the car and the up-to-date fashions of the models is juxtaposed with the misty nostalgia of the surrounding British landscape.
