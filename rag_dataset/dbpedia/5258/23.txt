John Henry Timmis IV's The Cure for Insomnia, as registered by Guinness World Records in 1987, was the world's longest movie, at a running time of 5,220 minutes (87 hours, or 3 days and 15 hours). The film has no plot, instead featuring artist L.D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem "A Cure for Insomnia" over the course of three and a half days, with interspersed clips from heavy metal and pornographic videos. It was first shown at The School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois from January 31 to February 3, 1987, but was never released for public viewing. If it had been available on DVD, it would have been a 22-disc set.
