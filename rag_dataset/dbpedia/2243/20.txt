Four new gas processing plants will be gradually operated in Kazakhstan until 2030. According to the Ministry of Energy forecasts, the volume of marketable gas production in Kazakhstan will steadily grow from 22.5 billion cubic meters in 2023 to 36.6 billion cubic meters by 2030.

To attract investment in the exploration and development of new gas fields, QazaqGaz and Chevron signed an agreement on joint implementation of geological exploration works at the Zhalibek area in the Aktobe region. The Road Map aims to increase the resource base of marketable gas. In 2023, the Rozhkovskoye, Urikhtau Vostochny, and Anabai fields, which have total recoverable gas reserves of 35.5 billion cubic meters, were put into commercial operation.

Four gas processing plants are planned for commissioning from 2026 to 2030: two at the Kashagan field with annual capacities of 1 and 2.5 billion cubic meters (Qatari investor UCC Holding was involved), one at the Karachaganak field with a capacity of 4 billion cubic meters per year, and KazGPZ in Zhanaozen with a capacity of 900 mln cubic meters per year.
