A Brief History of the Letter Q

The story of the letter Q has a rich and compelling history, beginning with ancient civilizations and carrying forward into the present day.

Q’s journey begins with the Semitic language, where it was represented by a glyph meaning “monkey.”

This character, called “qoph,” was adopted by the Phoenicians and represented a sound that doesn’t exist in English but is somewhat similar to a ‘k’ sound produced further back in the throat. In their alphabet, qoph was depicted as a pictogram that somewhat resembled a knot.

When the Greeks adopted the Phoenician alphabet, they did not have this sound in their language, and they repurposed the character, turning the knot shape into a circle with a line through it, and used it to denote the /k/ sound before back vowels. They called this letter ‘koppa’ or ‘qoppa.’ However, as the Greek language evolved, the need for this letter diminished, and it was eventually dropped from the alphabet.

The Etruscans also borrowed from the Greek alphabet, keeping qoppa and its /k/ sound.

The Romans, in turn, adopted this letter from the Etruscans when creating the Latin alphabet. Initially, the Romans used Q exclusively before the vowel ‘u’ to represent sounds that were followed by a /w/ sound in the next syllable. This practice can still be observed in some English words derived from Latin, like ‘equal’ and ‘liquid.’ In the Latin alphabet, Q was given a tail, which distinguished it from the number zero once it was introduced. This characteristic form has largely remained intact through centuries.

In modern usage, Q has a variety of applications. In computing, ‘Q’ is often used as a shorthand for ‘queue.’ In the standard international phonetic alphabet, Q is used to represent a voiceless uvular stop — a type of consonantal sound. Moreover, ‘Q’ is used in various games and media as a unique character or symbol, often standing out due to its rarity and distinctive shape.

From its origins in an ancient glyph to its present-day usage, Q’s story is one of transformation and adaptation, reflecting how our alphabetic system has evolved over time to suit different languages and sounds.
