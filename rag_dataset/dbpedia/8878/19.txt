I recently came upon something sort of odd -- at least, I think it might be. As far as I knew, when Frank Zappa's late 1960s albums showed up on the Verve label, they used the silver-and-BLUE Verve label on the records. But I just was looking at a late 1960s copy that uses the silver-on-BLACK Verve label, which I thought was principally reserved for the company's jazz releases. And I've checked Discogs and don't see any indication of such a release listed in their data-base.

Any comments.

Okay -- thanks. Just it's nowhere to be found on Discogs, that I could see.
