Three Machine Learning Research Teams Awarded Access to the Largest Dataset of Digitized Student Work

WORCESTER, MA, February 7, 2023âASSISTments, a nonprofit organization founded in learning science, recently announced the winners of the first MathNet Competition sponsored by Doug Jaffe and Laurence Holt. In conjunction with the MathNet awards, ASSISTments will provide three university machine learning research teams with access to the largest dataset of digitized student work for the purpose of designing AI enabled technology to read, analyze, and score digitized student math work, and provide learning insights to math teachers.

MathNet Competition grants have been awarded to the following research teams:

Kent State University: PI: Karl W. Kosko, Co-PIs: Dr. Qiang Guan, Dr. Richard E. Ferdig

University of Florida: PI: Dr. Wanli Xing, Co-PIs: Dr. Anthony Botelho, Dr. Jinnie Shin

Worcester Polytechnic Institute: PI: Dr. Neil Heffernan, Co-PIs: Sami Baral, Abhishek Santhanam, Dr. Li Cheng

Grantees will have access to the ASSISTments dataset which includes over 3 Million images of student work spanning from grade 1 to high school algebra and geometry.

âWe envision a future in which K-12 mathematics education products support educators, students, and families with automated analysis of written student work,â commented Cristina Heffernan, Executive Director of The ASSISTments Foundation. âWe are thrilled with the high-caliber machine learning research teams and anticipate results that, when applied to the classroom, will improve real-time diagnostic assessment and feedback to students and teachers completing mathematics tasks.â

âThis project keeps the focus on student work completed as part of the math curriculum. Â These technologies will help educators focus time on the student papers most in need of attention while ensuring that all of the students' work can be considered when assessing how each student in the class is progressing,â commented Doug Jaffe, MathNet Co-Founder.

About the MathNet Teams and their Projects

â

1. Kent State University Team

The Team: PI: Karl W. Kosko, Co-PIs: Dr. Qiang Guan, Dr. Richard E. Ferdig

Project Title: Designing A Machine Learning Tool To Assess Childrenâs Fraction Arithmetic

Goal: This project aims to design and pilot a tool that allows teachers to take a picture and/or scan with their smartphone or tablet to receive an Machine Learning based report assessing the studentâs response, procedure, and level of reasoning with fractions.

2. University of Florida Team

The Team: PI: Dr. Wanli Xing, Co-PIs: Dr. Anthony Botelho, Dr. Jinnie Shin

Project Title: Project ViTAMR: Vision Transformer-based Augmentation through Diagnostic Feedback to Support Mathematical Reasoning

Goal: Project ViTAMR /vÄ«t-É-mÉr/ aims to generate new insights and understanding on studentsâ math learning strategies with hand-worked responses (e.g. images and texts) for mathematical reasoning and further create a machine learning pipeline using multimodal and multi task deep learning models to provide automatic diagnostic feedback for studentsâ mathematical reasoning. Diagnostic feedback has been shown to be a valuable pedagogical strategy to invoke, assist, and train studentsâ mathematical reasoning.

3. Â Worcester Polytechnic Institute Team

The Team: PI: Dr. Neil Heffernan, Co-PIs: Sami Baral, Abhishek Santhanam, Dr. Li Cheng

Project Title: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence to Analyze Studentsâ Math Work Uploaded in a Digital Platform

Goal:

1) Release a set of images (hopefully 100,000) that have PII stripped from them (studentsâ faces and their names that they might have written on the piece of paper and inadvertently included in their uploaded image) and publish the first paper using this data to spur the field to "beat" Dr. Heffernan and team;

2) Developing autoscoring techniques to facilitate teachers in assessment of student work with images.
