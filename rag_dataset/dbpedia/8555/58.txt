The International REC Standard Foundation board has authorized South Sudan as authorized issuance country with Energy Peace Partners (EPP) as the issuer of I-RECs.

EPP already issues I-RECs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I-RECs that qualify for a supplementary label from EPP certifying high impact social co-benefits in fragile, energy poor countries are known as Peace Renewable Energy Credits (P-RECs). The demand for P-RECs supports transformative new renewable energy projects in these settings. EPP is the exclusive issuer of P-RECs.
