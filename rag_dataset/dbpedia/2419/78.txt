On 18th April, 1943, American P-40’s intercepted a massive formation of Ju 52 transports between Tunisia and Sicily. Of 65 Ju 52’s, 24 were completely destroyed, while 35 were heavily damaged or forced to land. The massive Allied victory came about as part of the air offensive ‘Operation Flax’ that aimed to sever the airborne supply link between the Afrika Korps and Sicily and Italy. The Luftwaffe transport fleet, combined with losses at Stalingrad never recovered and was severely weakened for the rest of the war.

Enjoy! This one took a long time to shape into something good, so please comment or share if you liked it.

Very well done!

couldn’t help but thinking how much I wish the game had radio chatter like in your video. It adds so much to the overall experience but the devs seem uninterested in creating that level of immersion.

thanks for sharing, great job!!
