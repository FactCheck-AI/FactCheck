Chelsea Clinton will start a six-figure consulting job after she receives a master's from Oxford University later this year, Newsweek magazine says on its Web site.

The daughter of former President Bill Clinton will work in the New York office of London-based McKinsey & Co., newsweek.com said.

Clinton, 23, accepted the position Friday after she reportedly turned down McKinsey's offer of $100,000 a year to work at its London headquarters, according to the Web site.

Clinton, who is studying international relations at Oxford, will be one of 5,000 McKinsey consultants worldwide who research topics ranging from health care to corporate finance.
