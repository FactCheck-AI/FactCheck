Tottenham and Chelsea are competing for the new rising star of African football.

Nigerian striker Sani ­Emmanuel has had trials at Chelsea who were impressed by the 17 year-old.

But so were Tottenham, where the player voted the best player in tournament by FIFA in the world ­Under-17 championships in Nigeria earlier this ­season, was offered an ­extended stay.

Emmanuel plays for the My People football club in Nigeria and had a brief spell with Swedish club Bodens BK.

Tottenham appear to have the edge in the race to sign Emmanuel and rather than ask for a transfer fee, the My People club want a long-term relationship with the club Emmanuel joins.

It will mean trials for promising players and ­donations of kit and ­equipment.
