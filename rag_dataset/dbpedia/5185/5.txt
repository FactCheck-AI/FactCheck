Most people find it hard to believe that you can see spectacular sunsets like this in North Texas but they have not been to Truth Hill Farm that lies within a unique part of eastern Collin County about 1 hour north of Dallas.Â This picturesque area offers rolling hills with cineramic views you won't soon forget!

Come out to the farm and see how our animals are raised to produce high quality meats.

Â Contrast this sight with a trip past a cattle feed lot where hundreds of cattle may stand belly deep in their own waste and mud and eat bakery waste and commercially processed grain designed to produce fast weight gain.Â

Our cows and sheep are raised on natural pastures eating grasses and dry forages.
