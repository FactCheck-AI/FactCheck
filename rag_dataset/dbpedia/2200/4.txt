Amen, he was a master! An element sorely missing in the Yes sound after he left.

The first song I thought of when I saw this thread was Gong's "Eat That Phone Book Coda" with the great drum fills about 1/3rd of the way through the song.

Yeah.. to me a rimshot is like a flam or a triplet ending with a kick drum hit or cymbal crash, like after a joke is told.

But I did understand what the OP was getting at.

edit: wiki seems to disagree with the comic effect. apparently that is called a "sting"

I've always thought the intro snare strike in Like A Rolling Stone was a rimshot. With a heavy hitter on the throne, a powerful rimshot is one mighty loud sound if you're near the kit.

As far as I understand there are two kinds of rimshots? One is the "klack" sound ("Under the bridge") where the stick is on the snare already and just hits the rim.

The other one is the ringing "pong" sound ("Roundabout") which employs hitting the skin and the rim at once. It is very loud. Bruford explained in "Yesyears" he used it due to "poor bass amplification"
