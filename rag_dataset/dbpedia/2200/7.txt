Always on the same notes. Note lengths are all the same. Perhaps it is ghost notes causing this, but if this was trying to replicate a 'real' drummer, sure'y it would be the decay that is affected, not the 'crack' of a rim shot.

I've tried various things, including increasing the volume of each hit to the max, thinking the max 'crack' of a rim shot would surely come through, but it doesn't. And in other parts of the song, I still get the crack of the rim at settings of 100.

I've highlighted the hits below. The other notable thing is it's not consistent itself on playback. When I loop that part, the hits that have the crack I'm looking for change each time round. A hit on one pass of the loop won't always have the same sound the next time round.

So here is the issues in more detail, I've added a couple of examples. Both of these examples are running from the same point in my song. I have some ghost notes going on with the snare, but they are 'snare centre' notes. The main beat on the 2 and the 4 and 'rim shot snare'. They are all the same, all the same length, all the same velocity (116 - and I have this same problem whether it 90 or 127 or anywhere in between.

In this first example, if you image over the length, you have 16 rimshot snare beats (I'm counting fills as one hit for simplicity). In example one, you get the proper rimshot crack on snare hit 3, 7, 9, 12 and 15.

On this second example, you get the harsh rim shot crack on snare hits 8 (fill at the end of the bar), 11 and 13.

It's completely different each time round, even though it the same midi pattern.

Perhaps it is a round robin thing...but I'd like to be able to control it so I can make it consistent. If you listen to a real drummer, it's really obvious when they don't pull off a rimshot. Feels the same for me here, I want this bit of my song to have the punch of a rim shot.
