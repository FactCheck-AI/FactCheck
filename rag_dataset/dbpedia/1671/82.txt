San Diego State University plays host to the 2024 Mountain West Baseball Championship, beginning Thursday at Tony Gwynn Stadium.

After 30 games of conference play, Air Force, New Mexico, San José State and Fresno State clinched spots in the four-team double-elimination tournament, which will be held on the Mesa for the sixth time in the league’s 25-year history. SDSU last hosted two years ago.

The Aztecs (17-37, 10-20 MW) finished last in the conference and did not make the tournament. Nevada and UNLV also did not qualify.

Second-seeded New Mexico (28-24, 17-13 MW) battles No. 3 seed San José State (22-31, 16-14 MW) in the tournament opener at 1:30 p.m. Thursday. Regular-season conference champion, No. 1 seed Air Force (26-26, 18-12 MW), squares off against fourth-seeded Fresno State (29-26, 16-14) at 6 p.m.

Games are set through 6 p.m. Saturday, with a 1 p.m. game Sunday if needed.

Both games on Thursday represent rematches of last weekend’s final regular-season series. San José State took two of three games at home from New Mexico, while Air Force registered a home sweep of Fresno State.

Overall, the Spartans and Lobos split their six meetings during the 2024 campaign, while the Falcons held a 4-2 advantage against the Bulldogs.

Seating at Tony Gwynn Stadium is general admission. Individual day tickets start at $12, with all-session passes at $40.

In addition, the Mountain West Network will provide live coverage of the championship.

The winner of the MW Championship secures the league’s automatic berth for NCAA regional competition, beginning May 31 at various campus sites.
