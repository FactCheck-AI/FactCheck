“The Drowsy Chaperone” is a play within a play. A theatre fan, known only as “Man in Chair”, is a loner stuck in his apartment. His only joy is listening to a recording of his favourite 1920′s musical, “The Drowsy Chaperone”. As he listens to the recording, the characters and music in the play come to life and his apartment is transformed into a broadway stage. Hilarity and mayhem ensues as the zany and over-the-top characters play out the plot.

The Drowsy Chaperone debuted in 1998 at The Rivoli in Toronto and opened on Broadway on 1 May 2006. The show won the Tony Award for Best Book and Best Score. The show has had major productions in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York, London, and Japan, as well as two North American tours.
