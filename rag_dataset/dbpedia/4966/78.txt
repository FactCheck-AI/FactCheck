Housatonic Community College Theatre

Cob Carlson’s new two hour documentary about WPKN, The Greatest Radio Station in the World, will have a screening at Housatonic Community College, in the Black Box Theater 900 Lafayette Street on Saturday. It is being brought to the community by the Bridgeport History Center, in conjunction with the Theatre Arts Department at Housatonic Community College, and WPKN.

The film tells the 60-year history of WPKN (launched in 1962) with a great deal of color, in-depth interviews with employees, programmers, station volunteers, and listeners going back to the founding, and unique “found” footage. The film highlights the city of Bridgeport and its integral role as the home for WPKN. Carlson will host a Q&A session with the audience after the screening.
