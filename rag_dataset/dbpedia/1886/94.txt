Settlements

A settlement is any form of human dwelling, from the smallest house to the largest city .- Oxford Dictionary of Geography

Settlements range from a small village to a megacity with millions of people. We have already learnt in previous notes that people chose to settle in different areas for a variety of reasons. As settlements grow they develop identifiable patterns which are used to classify them. Geographers study settlements because it is a reflection of the relationship between humans and their environment. These patterns are also used to project future settlement development. There are three main settlement patterns: nucleated, linear and dispersed.

Nucleated settlements comprise of buildings that are situated close together, usually clustering around a central area such as a river crossing or road junction.

Linear or ribbon settlements consist of structures that are built in a line, usually along a major transport route such as a road.
