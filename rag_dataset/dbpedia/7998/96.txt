Deadmau5 will be returning to his home ground this August as the headlining DJ for this year’s VELD Music Festival 2015. After a 1-year hiatus, and headlining VELD back in 2012 and 2013, this Toronto native is back to where it all started, uniting fans, fellow locals and bringing the crowd to its feet yet again.

And what better way to welcome back a hometown hero than to announce him as the first act, as well as the headliner of the fastest growing festival in Toronto, and possibly Canada.

Since its introduction in 2012, VELD has seen DJ’s such as Calvin Harris, Armin van Buuren, Avicii, Sebastian Ingrosso, Martin Garrix, Above & Beyond, Kaskade, Knife Party, Nero, and many others perform to sold-out crowds.
