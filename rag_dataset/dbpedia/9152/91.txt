The Red Hot Chili Peppers have no plans to start slowing down anytime soon. The rock band announced an extension to their Unlimited Love tour on Monday, with special guests Kid Cudi, Ice Cube, Ken Carson, and more.

The U.S. tour begins May 28 in Ridgefield, Washington, with additional stops in Salt Lake City, Utah; Tampa, Florida; Raleigh, North Carolina; Cincinnati, Ohio; Buffalo, New York; and St. Louis, Missouri. Other special guests during the 2024 US tour include Otoboke, Seun Kuti, Egypt80, Wand, and Irontom.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers wrapped up the Latin American leg of their 2023 tour with two November shows in Buenos Aires and previously announced three 2024 dates — Feb. 17, Feb. 20, and Feb. 23 — in California and Arizona.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers dropped Unlimited Love in April 2022, which reunited the group with longtime collaborator Rick Rubin for the first time since 2011. They dropped Return of the Dream Canteen six months later, and Rolling Stone’s Andy Greene described the 17-track album as leaning “deeper into the funk and sublime weirdness” that made the Chili Peppers a household name.

The old school-alt rock band also headlined Lollapalooza in August, with Flea landing a handstand to kickstart the show. They performed crowd-pleaser “Scar Tissue” and songs from their 12th and 13th studio albums like “Aquatic Mouth Dance” and “Carry Me Home.” The 40-year-old band isn’t new to the big stage and landed on the lineup for Sound on Sound, Hangout Music Festival, Pinkpop Mad Cool, and more.
