Texas is better known for its crude oil than for its olive oil, but a small olive industry is growing in South Texas. Recently on the local PBS station, KEDT-TV, a documentary was aired as part of its annual fund-raiser. It was called “Texas Olive Trails.” Check out this website to view a trailer.

Here is a quote from the site:

“Sun, stone, drought, silence and solitude: these are the five ingredients that, according to Italian folk traditions, create the ideal habitat for the Olive Tree.”

The area is also on the same geographical parallel as the Mediterranean. A large aquifer is found beneath the area stretching for many miles. OK…maybe it doesn’t look quite like Tuscany.

The olives will be harvested in September. I have not tried any before, but I intend to check out the 2011 Texas Olive Ranch products when they are available in my local grocery store – perhaps the Rattlesnake Pepper & Chipotle, Mesquite or Sweet Basil. For now check them out on their website . http://texasoliveranch.com/index.html They all appear to be extra virgin – always better.

In January I bought oil from a friend who has an olive farm in Tuscany and will post something about that later. Hint: it was excellent!

What is Success?

To laugh often and much:

To win the respect of intelligent people

and the affection of children;

To earn the appreciation of honest critics

and endure the betrayal of false friends;

To appreciate beauty:

To find the best in others;

To leave the world a bit better, whether by

a healthy child, a garden

patch or a redeemd social condition;

To know even one life has breathed

easier because you have lived.

This is to have succeeded.

–Ralph Waldo Emerson
