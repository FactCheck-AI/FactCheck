There seems to be absolutely no stopping Warner Bros and DC's Joker movie, as it has now made over $1 billion at the worldwide box office.

At the time of writing, Box Office Mojo has its worldwide takings at $1.017 billion, with $694 million of that coming from outside of American markets. Unbelievably, this is all in spite of the film not getting a release in China, the second biggest movie market in the world.

Director Todd Phillips shared a short video celebrating the milestone, and said: "Wow. What a ride this has been!! Thank you to the fans!"

Since the film had a relatively small production budget of $62.5 million, that also makes it the most profitable comic book movie of all time. Does that mean we are going to see a lot more smaller budgeted movies based on supervillains (beyond the Harley Quinn/Venom/Morbius ones we are already getting)?

Just why has the film been so popular, especially with its decidedly mixed reception? It's possible that the film has seen by some as a pushback against Hollywood's attempts to be more progressive (or 'woke', if you must) and that has attracted people, or at least attracted people who want to be part of the conversation about it.

Or maybe people just really like clowns.

Joker is in cinemas now, and is also available to pre-order on DVD and Blu-ray.
