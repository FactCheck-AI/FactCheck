The automotive industry is changing. People are using more mobility services like ride-sharing apps, and those that own cars are buying more used vehicles. This represents a challenge to the business models of long-established automakers like Groupe Renault, which manufactures and sells 3.75 million cars and light commercial vehicles each year under five main brands. The Group has responded with a wide-ranging digital transformation, focusing more on services. Central to this transformation has been the use of Amazon Web Services, specifically Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), AWS Lambda, and Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). In this video, Pierre Houl√®s, chief information officer for sales and marketing at Renault, explains how the group handled the challenge of decades of legacy technology and how a shift to DevOps changed the way the business operates. Plus, see how the success of Renault's first project on the new platform increased sales conversion rates by 15X and customer contacts by 25X, giving the business the confidence to continue its cloud journey.
