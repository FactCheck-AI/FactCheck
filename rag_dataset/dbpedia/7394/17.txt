We welcome Adam and look forward to capitalizing on his leadership and experience to help propel Beyond Identity to its next phase of corporate growth.â

"Beyond Identity is singularly focused on realizing a more secure world â without passwords. And I was drawn to the companyâs passion for, and commitment to, fulfilling that mission by using the same secure and scalable approach that is universally deployed and underpins trillions of dollars in online transactions daily,â said Clay. âIâm thrilled to join and collaborate with a legendary leadership team to deliver an elegant, passwordless authentication platform that maximizes business value by enhancing the user login experience while strengthening enterprise security.â

Founded by Silicon Valley icons Jim Clark and Jermoluk, Beyond Identity has introduced a revolutionary, passwordless identity management solution. Leveraging and extending inventions from Dr. Taher Elgamal, the âFather of SSL,â and Professor Dr. Martin Hellman, the co-inventor of public-key cryptography â headliners of Beyond Identityâs all-star technical advisory board â the company replaces passwords with X.509 certificates that are ubiquitously used within TLS (formerly SSL). The innovative approach enables customers to replace passwords with a highly scalable and universally trusted alternative. The company's cloud native solution and platform-based authenticator performs all certificate management functions and enables customers to implement risk-based authorization policiesâleveraging the security posture of the device logging in. This proven, secure, and scalable approach requires no changes to security infrastructures, reduces risk for organizations, and removes login friction for end users.
