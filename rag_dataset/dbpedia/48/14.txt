Students are advocating for a brighter future. dZi organized an assembly for the students from eleven child clubs in Aiselukharka and Kepilasgadi Rural Municipality to share their learnings and experiences, foster leadership and networking skills, and create an annual plan for 2024-25. Forty-four children participated and are now ready to implement the new plan in their schools. dZi also coordinated with the local government to incorporate the child clubs' plans into their yearly agenda and advocated for budget allocation to empower students and enhance the learning environment at schools. #childclub #empowernment #awareness #education #childrights #childdevelopment #equity #studentengagement #inclusive #thriving #resilient #khotang #aiselukharka #kepilasgadi #dZi #dZifoundation

Empowering girls through sports! In honor of International Women's Day, a secondary school in Khontang District worked with dZi to organize a girls' volleyball competition. The day was meant to foster girls' physical and social development, build their confidence, and help them identify their own goals. Athletes from eight schools participated in the event, and showed the power of play and connection in building inclusive and equitable communities. Shishu Madhyamik Vidyalaya from Maheshwori secured the top spot, followed by Tribhuvan Madhyamik Vidyalaya, from Aiselukharka, in second, and Simle Madhyamik Vidyalaya, from Jaleshwori, in third. Congratulations! #sports #girls #equity #empowernment #engagement #education #girlchild #empowernment #learneveryday #equityineducation #inclusive #goodgovernance #aiselukharka #khotang #dzi #dzifoundation

#Repost @ghumante ・・・ Bahanepokhari! You may not know it, but we visited Bahanepokhari twice during our trek to Mundhum Trail, first on the morning in Sibdu before hiking up towards Ghyangkharka, & second when we returned back. This natural pond on top of the hill was like ointment to our disappointing tour. We enjoyed every moment spent around this lake. Maybe because feeling happy in the presence of water body has been encrypted on our instincts, since we evolved from apes to humans.

When you are too lazy (or tired) to take out the big camera and make-do with your smartphone only to regret it a year later. Wild azaleas in all their glory all over my trail but by this time it was already more than 2 weeks of arduous daily trek through snow, wind, high altitude. My reluctance to use an SLR then - I now think will I ever come across such a beauty again? In my own home district no less? #travelnepal #woods #lovelywoods #views #mistymountain #rhododendron #upintheair #abovetheclouds #travelnepal #aiselukharka #trekking #nostalgia #placesimiss #throwback #landscapephotography #wheretherebedragons #azalea #wildflowers #wildflowersofnepal

Aiselukharka Fight Song (2020 version) . . . I’ve never actually written down the songs that I “write”, but there’s lots of random segments floating around in my brain. This little piece is a variation of something I’ve constantly played for years now. I have a video of me playing a much simpler version back in 2017 when I went to Nepal. The song is named after the place where I learned how to be patient. . #acoustic #acousticguitar #aiselukharka #martin #martinguitars #ancientaliens #thealienstaughtmethissong #iworshipthesnakedeityinthebackground
