“You Could Be Mine” is one of Guns N' Roses' greatest hits. Many remember it for being the theme song of Terminator II: Judgment Day. Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin co-wrote this song, and it’s mocking a potential suitor expressing how she’s too screwed up to be his.

The movie’s symbolism when the Terminator carries a box of roses with a gun inside it pays tribute to the band’s name.
