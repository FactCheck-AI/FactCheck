Darkness - Short Film Scored by Justin R. Durban

This is Colin Ross Smith from Foghorn Films. I have just posted my first short film online at YouTube:

I am posting in here about it because my film was scored by Justin R. Durban who did a wonderful job scoring Firecracker! So I thought that if those of you enjoyed Firecracker and found yourself growing to the music of Justin R. Durban then you may want to check out his work on Darkness. It is pretty powerful stuff! This is my first short film and so I am just trying to get my film out there and seen.

Cheers

Colin
