Released: 21st November 2022. Peter Cushing and Bernard Lee star in this pirate adventure. During the late 18th century, smuggling has become standard practice for fishermen around the British coast. When a band of pirates led by Black John (Lee), begin luring ships to their doom at Smuggler's Bay, the local community beg squire Trevenyan (Cushing) to bring an end to the wanton pillaging and murder.
