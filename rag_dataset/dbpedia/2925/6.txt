Built in 1892, this small brown-tuss covered bridge was built over the San Lorenzo River in response to years of complaints from the residents of Felton, who before needed to wade everything across the river to reach town. The bridge was the only access to Felton until the 1930s. The Felton Bridge, one of the last remaining covered bridges built of Redwood, is only 24m long but is 10m high, the tallest covered bridge in the United States. It is unknown why the bridge has such an elevated roof.
