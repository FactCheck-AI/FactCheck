Sony Pictures Classics will distribute director Woody Allen’s next film, “Blue Jasmine,” the studio announced Tuesday, marking the sixth partnership between the filmmaker and Sony’s art house division.

Sony Classics first released an Allen movie in 1999 with “Sweet and Lowdown.” The New York-based distributor has released the director’s last four movies, including 2011’s “Midnight in Paris,” Allen’s highest-grossing film ever (not adjusted for inflation), with domestic ticket sales of $56.8 million.

No release date has yet been set for “Blue Jasmine,” although Sony Classics tends to open Allen’s films in the middle of summer as a counter-programming alternative for sophisticated adult audiences.

The new film, described as “the story of the final stages of an acute crisis and a life of a fashionable New York housewife,” stars Alec Baldwin, Cate Blanchett, Bobby Cannavale, Louis C.K., Andrew Dice Clay, Sally Hawkins, Peter Sarsgaard and Michael Stuhlbarg.

The film was mostly shot in and around New York City and San Francisco.
