The following weapons were used in the film In the Name of the Father:

L1A1 SLR

British troops in Belfast are armed with the L1A1 SLR, the British variant of the FN FAL. Some of the rifles seen appear to be early model L1A1s with wooden furniture and the original cylindrical wood carry handle.

Sterling SMG

Sterling SMGs are used by British forces as well; some of this footage would later be reused for Season 2 of the series JAG.

Armalite AR-18

An IRA member uses an Armalite AR-18 to threaten Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis).

Umarex GPDA

The pistol seen pulled on Gerry appears to be a Browning BDA, but upon closer inspection, could be a Umarex GPDA replica.

Remington 870 shotgun

When the trial begins the police guarding the court house are seen with Remington 870 shotguns.

Smith & Wesson Model 10 HB
