Director Jim Sheridan's film version of the true story of the Guildford Four is a little slow, but it still cooks up many electrifying moments, thanks largely to three fantastic performances. Co-written by Terry George, In the Name of the Father (1993) feels not unlike most other "based on a true story" movies in that it tries harder to nail down important details than it does in finding the emotional spaces between the details. It's also too long and a little too aware of its own importance. But the story it tells is a good one; the outrageous injustice committed against innocent people gets the blood boiling.

Day-Lewis, who had won an Oscar working with Sheridan before on My Left Foot, is astounding playing the not-very-likable Gerry, enormously selfish and quick to feel sorry for himself. The actor finds a genuine emotional core that makes him relatable. We're with him every step of the way. His scenes with Postlethwaite -- and there are thankfully quite a few of them -- are the best in the movie. Their troubled, touching relationship feels like it goes back years and is based in absolute truth. Thompson has a rather tacked-on role, but she rages in it. You can feel the fire in her belly. All three actors received Oscar nominations for their work, and the film received four other nominations, including one for Best Picture. (Look quick for Saffron Burrows and Tom Wilkinson in small, early roles.)
