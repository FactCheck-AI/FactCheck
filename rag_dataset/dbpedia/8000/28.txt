Joel Thomas Zimmerman, or as everyone calls him, Deadmau5, a Canadian from Ontario, Canada, has recently announced his tour ‘Day of the Deadmaus Returns First starting in Winnipeg, CA, on September 22.Deadmau5 is well known for his art in electronic dance music (EDM). He is a performer and producer. He has also been the face of EDM since the 2000s; when Zimmerman was a kid, he took piano lessons and was interested in video gaming and computers. As he got older, he made music from an old computer, gave it to his local news station, and became a composer for a stock music company. Zimmerman came up with his name Deadmau5 because in 2002, he told people in a chat room that he had found a dead mouse in his computer. Ever since, the Deadmau5 has had eight studio albums, nine compilation albums, one soundtrack album, two video albums, seven mix albums, six extended plays, 48 singles, and 18 music videos.

Zimmerman also won his first Juno Award in 2008 for a dance recording of the year for “All U Ever Want,” a collaboration with Billy Newton-Davis.When Zimmerman started wearing his mous head costume, it was easily identifiable. So when he tried to wear it over in the U.S.A. Disney decided to pick a fight. Disney argued that the Deadmau5 logo resembled its classic Mickey Mouse silhouette and asserted that the Deadmau5 logo would damage its business worldwide. The two parties settled in June 2015. So far, lately, Deadmau5 has made new music and performed it on his recent tour; don’t forget to get tickets for the Chicago show on Oct. 27, 2023, before it all sells out on Deadmau5 website Ticketmaster.com.
