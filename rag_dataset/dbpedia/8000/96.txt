Internationally famous music producer Deadmau5 was born Joel Thomas Zimmerman on January 5, 1981, in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His interest in music peaked when he was just a teenager, having received a keyboard as a Christmas present. Though he began making music as early as 1995, it was not until a decade later that he was receiving wide recognition for his work. His debut album Get Scraped was released on July 26, 2005, and he went on to release three compilations in 2006, entitled Project 56, deadmau5 Circa 1998-2002, and A Little Oblique. The next year, he began his label mau5trap, and teaming up with Ultra Records and Ministry of Sound, he was able to release Random Album Title in 2008. Deadmau5 later released For Lack of a Better Name in 2009, featuring his popular hit singles “Ghosts ‘n’ Stuff” and “Strobe”, and in 2010, he was selected as the house DJ by MTV for the Video Music Awards.

That same year, he released 4×4=12, his fifth studio album, followed by Album Title Goes Here in 2012. He signed with Astralwerks, the NYC-based record label that is home to Swedish House Mafia and David Guetta. Deadmau5 went on to release an album in 2014, entitled while (1<2). His physical claim to fame, however, is his adornment of a big mouse helmet when he performs. The origin of his name comes from an incident that occurred when he was young, in which a dead mouse was found inside his computer.
