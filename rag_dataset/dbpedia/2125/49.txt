When the Clampett family unexpectedly strikes it rich, they move from the Ozarks to Beverly Hills. Suddenly 17-year-old Elly May, a beautiful but naïve tomboy, is thrown into a world of debutante balls, polo matches and people mainly concerned with their place in society. Nearly taken in by a couple of scheming ne’er-do-wells, Elly proves traditional country virtue triumphs over slick city vice. This musical is about compassion and tolerance—with a little moonshine and Ozark stompin’ thrown in to spice it all up. Learn More
