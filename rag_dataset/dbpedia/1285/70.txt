Eyemart Express, a nationwide chain with 188 locations in 36 states, opened its first Fort Collins store late last month.

The shop, at 1820 S. College Ave., is the company’s third location in Colorado, according to a press release.

Eyemart Express describes itself as “the fastest provider of prescription eyewear in the industry.” The Fort Collins store carries more than 2,000 frames from brands such as Ray-Ban, Calvin Klein, Kate Spade, Fendi, Gucci and more.

An on-site lab allows the store to provide same-day service for 90 percent of the glasses that customers order, the release said.

Optometrist Dr. Eric Torgerson is next door for customers who need an eye exam, according to the release.
