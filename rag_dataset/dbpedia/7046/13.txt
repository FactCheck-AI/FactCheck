LOS ANGELES, June 10 (UPI) -- DreamWorks has released a sneak peek of The Penguins of Madagascar.

The studio unveiled several movie stills on Sunday, much to the delight of fans. The images include the first look at Benedict Cumberbatch's character Classified, in addition to the eponymous penguins.

Penguins Skipper (Tom McGrath), Kowalski (Chris Miller), Rico (John DiMaggio) and Private (Christopher Knights) first appeared in a supporting role in the original Madagascar in 2005. The characters became instant fan favorites, and will star as the leads in the new film.

The upcoming movie follows the penguins as they combat the evil octopus Octavious Brine (John Malkovich). Classified (Benedict Cumberbatch) the wolf and Short Fuse (Ken Jeong) the seal are members of the secret protective organization North Wind, and provide the penguins with help.

"While North Wind uses all this slick gadgetry, the penguins rely on grit, spit and duct tape," executive producer McGrath says.

The Penguins of Madagascar is scheduled for release November 26.
