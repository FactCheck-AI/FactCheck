PHOTOS: Online 'School' Recruits Semi-Nude Models To Teach Mandarin

An online "school" based in China has recruited nearly-naked models in a bid to encourage foreigners to learn Mandarin.

These "teachers" are a far cry from the bespectacled, tweed-wearing traditional tutor who cracked canes over knuckles if Latin wasn't learnt correctly.

Despite coming under fire from Chinese feminists, the school - set up by Nottingham University graduate Kaoru Kickuchi, has become an internet sensation.

Kickuchi, a qualified architect and model who has appeared in FHM, said: "If you go the textbook way with all these Chinese characters it just makes you intimidated.

"If you start with the colloquial way â€¦ or sexy clips it is a different story."

The school has certainly taken its slogan "learning Mandarin in an unconventional way" to extremes...
