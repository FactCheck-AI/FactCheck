Description

The iPad Air is Apple's fifth generation full-sized iPad tablet, and the name is definitelly fitting for this remarkable device. It is only 7.5 millimeters thin and weighs just 469 grams, making it the lightest slate of this size. Its screen is identical to the one we know from its predecessor - a 9.7-inch Retina Display with oleophobic coating and resolution of 1536 by 2048 pixels. Under the hood, Apple has chosen to install its A7 chip, which is the very same 64-bit SoC powering the iPhone 5s. As a result, the new iPad is two times faster than the previous model. With the 5MP iSight camera, one can take detailed photos and 1080p Full HD videos, while the FaceTime HD front-facing snapper is ideal for video chats and self portraits. Connecting to the internet is done either via Wi-Fi, or over a 4G LTE network, should you choose a cellular-enabled iPad Air model. Apple's iOS 7 operating system is loaded onto the tablet, with iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote apps included at no cost.

The Power of Lightness

Phone owned for less than a year

You have to hold iPad Air to believe it. It’s just 7.5 millimeters thin and weighs just one pound. The stunning Retina display sits inside thinner bezels, so all you see is your content. And an incredible amount of power lies inside the sleek enclosure. So you can do so much more. With so much less.

The new A7 chip in iPad Air was designed with 64-bit architecture.So you get incredible power in a device you can take with you wherever you go.

The redesigned Smart Cover and Smart Case are a perfect fit for iPad Air. They automatically wake it when opened and put it to sleep when closed. They also fold to create a great stand for reading, viewing, and typing. And they come in a whole range of colors. So they don’t just work smart, they look smart.
