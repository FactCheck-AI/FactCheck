Hey folks, Harry here with a look at 11:14 by a first time director and a really cool cast. Sounds fun. Here ya go...

Hi Harry,

I've been a long time reader and fan of the site from the early days of dial-up and ID4. Having just moved to Toronto I've had the privelge of finally checking out the film festival.

11:14

First time director Greg Marcks presented this film on Friday to a sold out enthusiatic crowd. The opening credits were quite inventive and but seemed a little out of place. Anyways this was essentially a black comedy with a really cool cast: Henry Thomas, Patrick Swayze, Colin Hanks, Rachel Leigh Cook, Barbara Hershey and Hiliary Swank to name a few.

Marcks is a film school grad who before this film made 6 short films. Essentially 11:14 is made up of 5 shorts (as even Marcks admitted at the screening). THe movie is set in a small town where a drunken Henry Thomas appears to hit and kill a pedestrian at 11:14 pm. After attempting to cover it up he is arrested. From there it goes to Colin Hanks and some of his friends joy riding which results in one of the friends castration and the death of yet another pedestrian.

There other stories are told all occurring in the same town the same night (all within 30 minutes to an hour of each other). I won't give anything else away but it all tyes up in the end.

Rachel Leigh Cook is friggin hot in this film. Overall it was an enjoyable diversion. THe crowd seemed to be into it. It wasn't overally original or suprising but I still liked it. It sort of reminded me of Very Bad Things.

Marcks is a very young director (he seriously looked about 15) so I'm looking forward to seeing more from him in the future.

Later,
