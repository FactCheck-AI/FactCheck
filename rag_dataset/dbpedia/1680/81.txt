11:14 is a gimmicky but ultimately enjoyable little film involving several characters whose lives intersect one fateful night. An impressive list of actors – including Henry Thomas, Patrick Swayze, Rachael Leigh Cook, Shawn Hatosy, and Hilary Swank – make their way through this story featuring a chain reaction of events that leads to death. Director Greg Marcks doesn’t quite have the talent of a Paul Thomas Anderson, but he does a nice job of toying with the audiences’ expectations. Since the film kicks off with a pivotal moment, we know exactly where things are going – but Marcks proves to be effective at keeping us in suspense. And though the motivations of Swayze’s character are never made entirely clear, 11:14 is a fun little movie that never really amounts to much.
