Over the years a great many bootleg recordings have emerged on vinyl and CD. For the purposes of this list a bootleg is defined as "a recording professionally but illegally pressed on either CD or Vinyl featuring unofficial or otherwise unavailable to buy recordings." This is not a list of all the CD-R's out there (as anyone can put a recording on a CD-R now), nor does it feature items such as the Toronto '69 releases (which whilst unofficial, aren't illegally created). Some of these releases are now collectable in their own right regardless of the legalities involved.

These releases are listed in vaguely alphabetical order

This is certainly not a definitive list of such albums but if you have anything that's not listed then please send through the details and a small scan if possible to si@sickthingsuk.co.uk. Factory produced CD/LPs only, no CDRs. Cheers!
