This gallery showcases illustrations drawn for The New York Review by five artists: David Levine, whose more than 3,500 caricatures have illuminated articles published in the Review since 1963; and John Springs, Pancho (Francisco Grails), James Ferguson, and Siegfried Woldhek whose works have been published regularly in the Review over the past few years.

About the galleries

The galleries showcase illustrations of presidents and poets, composers and scientists—from Achebe, Agnew, and Albee to Zapata, Zola, and Zyuganov. The works of David Levine are in black and white and those of John Springs, Pancho, James Ferguson, and Siegfried Woldhek are in color.

At this time, we are only able to sell prints by David Levine. Each print has an approximate image size of 7″ x 9-½″ and is printed on heavy white archival paper with an off-white acid-free archival mat (with a 9″ x 11.5″ opening). A matte black wood-composite glass frame is 13-½″ x 17-¾″ x 1-⅝″. The black front border of the frame is 1″ wide.

Use the search and browse functions to view the the drawings by date or subject, and click on the thumbnails provided for a larger image and ordering information. As each print is made to order, please allow five–ten business days for printing and framing, in addition to shipping time.
