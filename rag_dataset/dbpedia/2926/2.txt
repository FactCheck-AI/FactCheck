Description

Felton Covered Bridge in Bedford Pennsylvania. The bridge was built in 1892 using the Burr truss, its length is 105 ft. and width 12 ft. 6 in. The Builder was W.S. Mullins and is privately owned. The bridge crosses Brush Creek and is only open to foot traffic. The location is off State Route 2029 approximately 1.5 miles west of Jackson Mills in East Providence Twp.

I can say this is one of the most heart breaking sites of covered bridges I had the misfortune of seeing in the state of Pennsylvania. The bridge has no access to it anymore because of the over growth of trees, weeds and any other garbage you may encounter on the path. The bridge is in bad need of repair, I personally don't believe it can last a few more years without falling into the creek. It is evident the owners have no interest in this historical structure, the only thing I can see that will save it is if the county acquires it. As you can see by the photo it is close to impossible to get a good photograph of the bridge. Unless something is done I would not waste my time investigating the structure. Google
