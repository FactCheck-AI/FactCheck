Origin/meaning

Shoulder Sleeve Insignia:Maroon and white are the colors traditionally used by the Medical units. The diamond shape of the insignia signifies courage and energy of the cadre, to educate and direct the troops in the field of Health Sciences. The couped cross, universal symbol for medical care, denotes the brigade's focus on medical service. The torch refers to guidance and knowledge, and the brigade's mission of training the troops. The star symbolizes Texas, the largest state in the Continental United States and location of the 32d Medical Brigade.

Distinctive Unit Insignia:The shield is maroon, the first named color of the Medical Department. The torch represents knowledge entwined by the green serpent, taken from the staff of Aesculapius, the Father of Medicine. The motto translates to "We Conserve the Personnel."
