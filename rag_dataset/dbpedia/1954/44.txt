Short summary

Short summary

The state of sea ice strongly affects its absorption of solar energy. In May 2019, we flew uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with sensors designed to quantify the sunlight that is reflected by sea ice at each wavelength over the sea ice of Kotzebue Sound, Alaska. We found that snow patches get darker (up to ~ 20 %) as they get smaller, while bare patches get darker (up to ~ 20 %) as they get larger. We believe that this difference is due to melting around the edges of small features.

In this paper, we present the first edition of a global database compiling previously published and unpublished measurements of dissolved organic matter (DOM) collected in coastal waters (CoastDOM v1). Overall, the CoastDOM v1 dataset will be useful to identify global spatial and temporal patterns and to facilitate reuse in studies aimed at better characterizing local biogeochemical processes and identifying a baseline for modelling future changes in coastal waters.

Spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the increase in ocean acidity extremes in the northeastern Pacific

Flora Desmet, Matthias MÃ¼nnich, and Nicolas Gruber

Biogeosciences, 20, 5151–5175, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5151-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-5151-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Ocean acidity extremes in the upper 250 m depth of the northeastern Pacific rapidly increase with atmospheric CO2 rise, which is worrisome for marine organisms that rapidly experience pH levels outside their local environmental conditions. Presented research shows the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in this increase between regions and depths. In particular, the subsurface increase is substantially slowed down by the presence of mesoscale eddies, often not resolved in Earth system models.

Short summary

Short summary

For assessing the consequences of human-induced climate change for the marine realm, it is necessary to not only look at gradual changes but also at abrupt changes of environmental conditions. We summarise abrupt changes in ocean warming, acidification, and oxygen concentration as the key environmental factors for ecosystems. Taking these abrupt changes into account requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced to a larger extent than previously thought to limit respective damage.

Short summary

Short summary

N2 fixation by marine diazotrophs is an important bioavailable N source to the global ocean. This updated global oceanic diazotroph database increases the number of in situ measurements of N2 fixation rates, diazotrophic cell abundances, and nifH gene copy abundances by 184 %, 86 %, and 809 %, respectively. Using the updated database, the global marine N2 fixation rate is estimated at 223 Â± 30 Tg N yr−1, which triplicates that using the original database.

Non-volatile marine and non-refractory continental sources of particle-phase amine during the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES)

Short summary

Short summary

Amines are compounds emitted from a variety of marine and continental sources and were measured by aerosol mass spectrometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy during the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES) cruises. Secondary continental and primary marine sources of amines were identified by comparisons to tracers. The results show that the two methods are complementary for investigating amines in the marine environment.

Including filter-feeding gelatinous macrozooplankton in a global marine biogeochemical model: modelâdata comparison and impact on the ocean carbon cycle

Corentin Clerc, Laurent Bopp, Fabio Benedetti, Meike Vogt, and Olivier Aumont

Biogeosciences, 20, 869–895, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-869-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-20-869-2023, 2023

Short summary

Short summary

Gelatinous zooplankton play a key role in the ocean carbon cycle. In particular, pelagic tunicates, which feed on a wide size range of prey, produce rapidly sinking detritus. Thus, they efficiently transfer carbon from the surface to the depths. Consequently, we added these organisms to a marine biogeochemical model (PISCES-v2) and evaluated their impact on the global carbon cycle. We found that they contribute significantly to carbon export and that this contribution increases with depth.

Short summary

Short summary

A compiled set of in situ data is vital to evaluate the quality of ocean-colour satellite data records. Here we describe the global compilation of bio-optical in situ data (spanning from 1997 to 2021) used for the validation of the ocean-colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI). The compilation merges and harmonizes several in situ data sources into a simple format that could be used directly for the evaluation of satellite-derived ocean-colour data.

Short summary

Short summary

This paper presents a dataset acquired during a research cruise held in Baffin Bay in 2016. We observed that the disappearance of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean increases both the length and spatial extent of the phytoplankton growth season. In the future, this will impact the food webs on which the local populations depend for their food supply and fisheries. This dataset will provide insight into quantifying these impacts and help the decision-making process for policymakers.

Quantifying biological carbon pump pathways with a data-constrained mechanistic model ensemble approach

Michael R. Stukel, Moira DÃ©cima, and Michael R. Landry

Biogeosciences, 19, 3595–3624, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3595-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-3595-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The biological carbon pump (BCP) transports carbon into the deep ocean, leading to long-term marine carbon sequestration. It is driven by many physical, chemical, and ecological processes. We developed a model of the BCP constrained using data from 11 cruises in 4 different ocean regions. Our results show that sinking particles and vertical mixing are more important than transport mediated by vertically migrating zooplankton. They also highlight the uncertainty in current estimates of the BCP.

Primary productivity measurements in the Ross Sea, Antarctica: a regional synthesis

Walker O. Smith Jr.

Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 14, 2737–2747, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2737-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-14-2737-2022, 2022

Short summary

Short summary

The rate of photosynthesis of marine phytoplankton – primary productivity – is typically measured by quantifying the rate of radioisotope incorporation. However, generally such measurements are not collected by one individual through time and so are difficult to compare due to methodological differences. A data set compiled by one investigator over more than 20 years in the Ross Sea demonstrates the importance of the region as a "hot spot" for growth and synthesis.

Short summary

Here we describe a dataset of optical measurements paired with the concentration and composition of dissolved and particulate components of water systems in Belgium. Sampling was performed over eight lakes, a coastal lagoon, an estuary, and coastal waters, covering the period of 2017 to 2019. The data cover a broad range of conditions and can be useful for development and evaluation of hyperspectral methods in hydrology optics and remote sensing.

Short summary

Short summary

Atmospheric particle concentrations impact clouds, which strongly impact the amount of sunlight reflected back into space and the overall climate. Measurements of particles over the ocean are rare and expensive to collect, so models are necessary to fill in the gaps by simulating both particle and clouds. However, some measurements are needed to test the accuracy of the models. Here, we measure changes in particles in different weather conditions, which are ideal for comparison with models.

Short summary

Short summary

This study assesses marine biological production in two Mediterranean systems representative of vast desert-like (oligotrophic) areas encountered in the global ocean. We use a novel approach based on non-intrusive high-frequency in situ measurements by two profiling robots, the BioGeoChemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats. Our results indicate substantial yet variable production rates and contribution to the whole water column of the subsurface layer, typically considered steady and non-productive.

Short summary

Short summary

A natural hazard is a naturally occurring extreme event with a negative effect on people, society, or the environment; major events in the study area include wind storms, extreme waves, high and low sea level, ice ridging, heavy precipitation, sea-effect snowfall, river floods, heat waves, ice seasons, and drought. In the future, an increase in sea level, extreme precipitation, heat waves, and phytoplankton blooms is expected, and a decrease in cold spells and severe ice winters is anticipated.

Biogeosciences, 18, 6349–6375, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6349-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-6349-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

We show that for an unperturbed cold western Antarctic Peninsula fjord, the seasonality of iron and manganese is linked to the dispersal of metal-rich meltwater sources. Geochemical measurements of trace metals in meltwaters, porewaters, and seawater, collected during two expeditions, showed a seasonal cycle of distinct sources. Finally, model results revealed that the dispersal of surface meltwater and meltwater plumes originating from under the glacier is sensitive to katabatic wind events.

SeaFlux: harmonization of airâsea CO2 fluxes from surface pCO2 data products using a standardized approach

Short summary

Short summary

The movement of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to the ocean is estimated using surface ocean carbon (pCO2) measurements and an equation including variables such as temperature and wind speed; the choices of these variables lead to uncertainties. We introduce the SeaFlux ensemble which provides carbon flux maps calculated in a consistent manner, thus reducing uncertainty by using common choices for wind speed and a set definition of "global" coverage.

Short summary

Short summary

Based on profiling pCO2 measurements from a field campaign, we quantify the biomass production of a cyanobacteria bloom in the Baltic Sea, the export of which would foster deep water deoxygenation. We further demonstrate how this biomass production can be accurately reconstructed from long-term surface measurements made on cargo vessels in combination with modelled temperature profiles. This approach enables a better understanding of a severe concern for the Balticâs good environmental status.

Short summary

Short summary

Ocean sediments form the largest and longest-term storage of organic carbon. Despite their global importance, information on these sediments is often scattered, incomplete or inaccessible. Here we present MOSAIC (Modern Ocean Sediment Archive and Inventory of Carbon, mosaic.ethz.ch), a (radio)carbon-centric database that addresses this information gap. This database provides a platform for assessing the transport, deposition and storage of carbon in ocean surface sediments.

Drivers and impact of the seasonal variability of the organic carbon offshore transport in the Canary upwelling system

Biogeosciences, 18, 2429–2448, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2429-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2429-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Seasonal variations of processes such as upwelling and biological production that happen along the northwestern African coast can modulate the temporal variability of the biological activity of the adjacent open North Atlantic hundreds of kilometers away from the coast thanks to the lateral transport of coastal organic carbon. This happens with a temporal delay, which is smaller than a season up to roughly 500 km from the coast due to the intense transport by small-scale filaments.

Short summary

Short summary

The MALINA oceanographic expedition was conducted in the Mackenzie River and the Beaufort Sea systems. The sampling was performed across seven shelf–basin transects to capture the meridional gradient between the estuary and the open ocean. The main goal of this research program was to better understand how processes such as primary production are influencing the fate of organic matter originating from the surrounding terrestrial landscape during its transition toward the Arctic Ocean.

Deep maxima of phytoplankton biomass, primary production and bacterial production in the Mediterranean Sea

Short summary

Short summary

The concentration of chlorophyll is commonly used as an indicator of the abundance of photosynthetic plankton (phytoplankton) in lakes and oceans. Our study investigates why a deep chlorophyll maximum, located near the bottom of the upper, illuminated layer develops in the Mediterranean Sea. We find that the acclimation of cells to low light is the main mechanism involved and that this deep maximum represents also a maximum in the biomass and carbon fixation activity of phytoplankton.

OceanSODA-ETHZ: a global gridded data set of the surface ocean carbonate system for seasonal to decadal studies of ocean acidification

Luke Gregor and Nicolas Gruber

Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 13, 777–808, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-777-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-777-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Ocean acidification (OA) has altered the ocean's carbonate chemistry, with consequences for marine life. Yet, no observation-based data set exists that permits us to study changes in OA. We fill this gap with a global data set of relevant surface ocean parameters over the period 1985–2018. This data set, OceanSODA-ETHZ, was created by using satellite and other data to extrapolate ship-based measurements of carbon dioxide and total alkalinity from which parameters for OA were computed.

Short summary

Short summary

Models describing atmospheric airflow were combined with satellite measurements representative of marine phytoplankton and other meteorological variables. These combined variables were compared to measured aerosol to identify upwind influences on aerosol concentrations. Results indicate that phytoplankton production rates upwind impact the aerosol mass. Also, results suggest that the condensation of mass onto short-lived large sea spray particles may be a significant sink of aerosol mass.

Circulation timescales of Atlantic Water in the Arctic Ocean determined from anthropogenic radionuclides

Ocean Sci., 17, 111–129, https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-111-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/os-17-111-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Atlantic Water that carries heat and anthropogenic carbon into the Arctic Ocean plays an important role in the Arctic sea-ice cover decline, but its pathways and travel times remain unclear. Here we used two radionuclides of anthropogenic origin (129I and 236U) to track Atlantic-derived waters along their way through the Arctic Ocean, estimating their travel times and mixing properties. Results help to understand how future changes in Atlantic Water properties will spread through the Arctic.

A Lagrangian study of the contribution of the Canary coastal upwelling to the nitrogen budget of the open North Atlantic

Short summary

Short summary

Using a Lagrangian modeling approach, this study provides a quantitative analysis of water and nitrogen offshore transport in the Canary Current System. We investigate the timescales, reach and structure of offshore transport and demonstrate that the Canary upwelling is a key source of nutrients to the open North Atlantic Ocean. Our findings stress the need for improving the representation of the Canary system and other eastern boundary upwelling systems in global coarse-resolution models.

Factors controlling the competition between Phaeocystis and diatoms in the Southern Ocean and implications for carbon export fluxes

Cara Nissen and Meike Vogt

Biogeosciences, 18, 251–283, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-251-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-251-2021, 2021

Short summary

Short summary

Using a regional Southern Ocean ecosystem model, we find that the relative importance of Phaeocystis and diatoms at high latitudes is controlled by iron and temperature variability, with light levels controlling the seasonal succession in coastal areas. Yet, biomass losses via aggregation and grazing matter as well. We show that the seasonal succession of Phaeocystis and diatoms impacts the seasonality of carbon export fluxes with ramifications for nutrient cycling and food web dynamics.

Spectral characterization, radiative forcing and pigment content of coastal Antarctic snow algae: approaches to spectrally discriminate red and green communities and their impact on snowmelt

Short summary

Short summary

We present radiative forcing (RF) estimates by snow algae in the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) region from multi-year measurements of solar radiation and ground-based hyperspectral characterization of red and green snow algae collected during a brief field expedition in austral summer 2018. Mean daily RF was double for green (~26 W m−2) vs. red (~13 W m−2) snow algae during the peak growing season, which is on par with midlatitude dust attributions capable of advancing snowmelt.

Short summary

Short summary

Zooplankton are the smallest animals in the ocean and important food for fish. Despite their importance, zooplankton have been relatively undersampled. To better understand the zooplankton community in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), we developed a model to simulate their dynamics. We found that heterotrophic protists are important for supporting mesozooplankton, which are the primary prey of larval fish. The model developed in this study has the potential to improve fisheries management in the GoM.

Short summary

Short summary

Cyanobacterial blooms represent a threat to the Baltic Sea ecosystem, causing deoxygenation of the bottom water. In order to understand the natural versus anthropogenic factors driving these blooms, it is necessary to study long-term trends beyond observations. We have produced a record of cyanobacterial blooms since 1860 using organic molecules (biomarkers) preserved in sediments. Cyanobacterial blooms in the Baltic Sea are likely mainly related to temperature variability.

Short summary

Short summary

We report on biological productivity under turbulent nitrate flux amplified with the Kuroshio. Oceanographic observations exhibit that the Kuroshio topographically enhances significant turbulent mixing and nitrate influx to the euphotic zone. Onboard experiments show phytoplankton and microzooplankton growths enhanced with the nitrate flux and a significant microzooplankton grazing on phytoplankton. These rapid and systematic trophodynamics enhance biological productivity in the Kuroshio.

Earth Syst. Sci. Data, 12, 907–933, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-907-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-12-907-2020, 2020

Short summary

Short summary

Phytoplankton sustain marine life, as they are the principal primary producers in the global ocean. Despite their ecological importance, their distribution and diversity patterns are poorly known, mostly due to data limitations. We present a global dataset that synthesizes over 1.3 million occurrences of phytoplankton from public archives. It is easily extendable. This dataset can be used to characterize phytoplankton distribution and diversity in current and future oceans.

A global end-member approach to derive aCDOM(440) from near-surface optical measurements

Short summary

Short summary

A Kd(λ) and aCDOM(440) data set spanned oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. The algorithmic approach, based on Kd end-member pairs, can be used globally. End-members with the largest spectral span had an accuracy of 1.2–2.4 % (RMSE). Validation was influenced by subjective nonconservative water masses. The influence of subcategories was confirmed with an objective cluster analysis.

Short summary

Short summary

As remote sensing is becoming more integral in future plastic litter monitoring strategies, there is need to improve our understanding of the optical properties of plastics. We present spectral reflectance data (350–2500 nm) of wet and dry marine-harvested (Atlantic and Pacific oceans), washed-ashore, and virgin plastics. Absorption features were identified at ~ 931, 1215, 1417 and 1732 nm in both the marine-harvested and washed-ashore plastics.

Short summary

Short summary

A compiled set of in situ data is useful to evaluate the quality of ocean-colour satellite data records. Here we describe the compilation of global bio-optical in situ data (spanning from 1997 to 2018) used for the validation of the ocean-colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI). The compilation merges and harmonizes several in situ data sources into a simple format that could be used directly for the evaluation of satellite-derived ocean-colour data.

Short summary

Short summary

As commonly observed in oligotrophic stratified waters, a subsurface (or deep) chlorophyll maximum (SCM) frequently characterizes the vertical distribution of phytoplankton chlorophyll in the Mediterranean Sea. SCMs often result from photoacclimation of the phytoplankton organisms. However they can also result from an actual increase in phytoplankton carbon biomass. Our results also suggest that a variety of intermediate types of SCMs are encountered between these two endmember situations.

Short summary

Short summary

We review and synthesize available information on coastal ocean carbon fluxes around North America (NA). There is overwhelming evidence, compiled and discussed here, that the NA coastal margins act as a sink. Our synthesis shows the great diversity in processes driving carbon fluxes in different coastal regions, highlights remaining gaps in observations and models, and discusses current and anticipated future trends with respect to carbon fluxes and acidification.

Short summary

Short summary

The understanding of surface water methane production in the world oceans is still poor. By combining field studies and incubation experiments, our investigations suggest that zooplankton contributes to subthermocline methane enrichments in the central Baltic Sea by methane production within the digestive tract of copepods and/or by methane production through release of methane precursor substances into the surrounding water, followed by microbial degradation to methane.

Factors controlling coccolithophore biogeography in the Southern Ocean

Cara Nissen, Meike Vogt, Matthias MÃ¼nnich, Nicolas Gruber, and F. Alexander Haumann

Biogeosciences, 15, 6997–7024, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6997-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-6997-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Using a regional ocean model, we find that coccolithophore biomass in the Southern Ocean is highest in the subantarctic in late summer when diatom growth becomes limited by silicate. We show that zooplankton grazing is crucial to explain phytoplankton biomass distributions in this area and conclude that assessments of future distributions should not only consider physical and chemical factors (temperature, light, nutrients, pH), but also interactions with other phytoplankton or zooplankton.

Revised manuscript not accepted

Short summary

Short summary

We studied long-term satellite data of the Barents and Kara Seas (BKS) of atmospheric CH4 and sea surface temperature (SST). Enhanced CH4 was found near Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land, sources not in current budgets and areas of shoalingâwhere currents drive CH4ârich seabed water upslope to escape to the atmosphere, far from the source. Trends suggest increasing current heat transport warms the seabed, driving CH4 seepage from submerged hydrates and permafrost.

Mesoscale contribution to the long-range offshore transport of organic carbon from the Canary Upwelling System to the open North Atlantic

Elisa Lovecchio, Nicolas Gruber, and Matthias MÃ¼nnich

Biogeosciences, 15, 5061–5091, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5061-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-5061-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

We find that the ocean's flow on scales of a few tens to a few hundred km has a central role in the lateral redistribution of the organic carbon from the coast to the open ocean. Narrow coastal filaments drive the offshore flux of organic carbon and strongly enhance its availability up to 1000 km from the coast. Eddies extend the flux up to 2000 km offshore containing 30 % of the organic matter in the open waters. Resolving these scales is essential to capture the coastal/open ocean coupling.

Imprint of Southern Ocean mesoscale eddies on chlorophyll

Short summary

Short summary

Although mesoscale ocean eddies are ubiquitous in the Southern Ocean (SO), their regional and seasonal association with phytoplankton has not been quantified. We identify over 100 000 eddies and determine the associated phytoplankton biomass anomalies using satellite-based chlorophyll (Chl) as a proxy. The emerging Chl anomalies can be explained largely by lateral advection of Chl by eddies. This impact of eddies on phytoplankton may implicate downstream effects on SO biogeochemical properties.

Seasonal patterns in phytoplankton biomass across the northern and deep Gulf of Mexico: a numerical model study

Short summary

Short summary

Seasonal patterns in nanophytoplankton and diatom biomass in the Gulf of Mexico were examined with an ocean–biogeochemical model. We found silica limitation of model diatom growth in the deep GoM and Mississippi delta. Zooplankton grazing and both transport and vertical mixing of biomass substantially influence the model phytoplankton biomass seasonality. We stress the need for integrated analyses of biologically and physically driven biomass fluxes to describe phytoplankton seasonal changes.

Revised manuscript has not been submitted

Short summary

Short summary

Based on long-term satellite data of sea surface temperature and methane in the Barents and Kara Seas trends of increasing methane and sea surface temperature were found that were related to strengthening currents with strong methane anomalies near Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya. Likely sources are methane seepage from subsea permafrost and hydrates, with current shoaling aiding the transport of near seabed dissolved methane to upper waters and the atmosphere.

Assimilating bio-optical glider data during aÂ phytoplankton bloom in the southern Ross Sea

Daniel E. Kaufman, Marjorie A. M. Friedrichs, John C. P. Hemmings, and Walker O. Smith Jr.

Biogeosciences, 15, 73–90, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-73-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-73-2018, 2018

Short summary

Short summary

Computer simulations of the highly variable phytoplankton in the Ross Sea demonstrated how incorporating data from different sources (satellite, ship, or glider) results in different system interpretations. For example, simulations assimilating satellite-based data produced lower carbon export estimates. Combining observations with models in this remote, harsh, and biologically variable environment should include consideration of the potential impacts of data frequency, duration, and coverage.

Spatiotemporal patterns of the fossil-fuel CO2 signal in central Europe: results from a high-resolution atmospheric transport model

Yu Liu, Nicolas Gruber, and Dominik Brunner

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 17, 14145–14169, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14145-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-14145-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

We analyze fossil fuel signals in atmospheric CO2 over Europe using a high-resolution atmospheric transport model and diurnal emission data. We find that fossil fuel CO2 accounts for more than half of the atmospheric CO2 variations, mainly at diurnal timescales. The covariance of diurnal emission and transport also leads to a substantial rectification effect. Thus, the consideration of diurnal emissions and high-resolution transport is paramount for accurately modeling the fossil fuel signal.

Autonomous robotic platforms such as Biogeochemical-Argo floats allow observation of the ocean, from the surface to the interior, in a new and systematic way. A fleet of 105 of these platforms have collected several biological, biogeochemical, and optical variables in still unexplored regions. The quality-controlled databases presented here will enable scientists to improve knowledge on the functioning of marine ecosystems and investigate the climatic implications.

Here we synthesize a wide range of global spatiotemporal observational data on carbon exchanges between the Earth surface and the atmosphere. A key challenge was to consistently combining observational products of terrestrial and aquatic surfaces.

On the long-range offshore transport of organic carbon from the Canary Upwelling System to the open North Atlantic

Elisa Lovecchio, Nicolas Gruber, Matthias MÃ¼nnich, and Zouhair Lachkar

Biogeosciences, 14, 3337–3369, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3337-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3337-2017, 2017

Short summary

Short summary

We find that a big portion of the phytoplankton, zooplankton, and detrital organic matter produced near the northern African coast is laterally transported towards the open North Atlantic. This offshore flux sustains a relevant part of the biological activity in the open sea and reaches as far as the middle of the North Atlantic. Our results, obtained with a state-of-the-art model, highlight the fundamental role of the narrow but productive coastal ocean in sustaining global marine life.

Preprint withdrawn

Short summary

Short summary

This work delivers a regional estimates of primary production due to diatoms, haptophytes and cyanobacteria around the Kuroshio current. Using a novel methodology, photosynthetic efficiency and abundance of marine phytoplankton are now viewed from a satellite in space. Our see that variability in primary production by diatoms is mainly regulated by their abundance rather than their efficiency, whereas the variability by cyanobacteria is more regulated by their efficiency than their abundance.

Short summary

Short summary

We present a global biogeochemical model which incorporates ecosystem dynamics based on the representation of ten plankton functional types, and use the model to assess the relative roles of iron vs. grazing in determining phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean. Our results suggest that observed low phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean during summer is primarily explained by the dynamics of the Southern Ocean zooplankton community, despite iron limitation of phytoplankton growth.

Projected decreases in future marine export production: the role of the carbon flux through the upper ocean ecosystem

Short summary

Short summary

We compare future projections in marine export production, generated by four ecosystem models under IPCC's high-emission scenario RCP8.5. While all models project decreases in export, they differ strongly regarding the drivers. The formation of sinking particles of organic matter is the most uncertain process with models not agreeing on either magnitude or the direction of change. Changes in diatom concentration are a strong driver for export in some models but of low significance in others.

Short summary

Short summary

This study provides the general relationship between the timing of sea ice retreat and phytoplankton size structure during the marginal ice zone bloom period in the Chukchi and Bering shelves using a satellite remote sensing approach. We also found that not only the length of the ice-free season but also the annual phytoplankton size composition positively correlated with annual net primary production.

Short summary

Short summary

This study investigates variations in the CO2 uptake of the ocean from year to year. These variations have been calculated from measurements of the surface-ocean carbon content by various different interpolation methods. The equatorial Pacific is estimated to be the region with the strongest year-to-year variations, tied to the El Nino phase. The global ocean CO2 uptake gradually increased from about the year 2000. The comparison of the interpolation methods identifies these findings as robust.

Short summary

Short summary

We analyze changes in marine net primary production (NPP) and its drivers for the 21st century in 9 marine ecosystem models under the RCP8.5 scenario. NPP decreases in 5 models and increases in 1 model; 3 models show no significant trend. The main drivers include stronger nutrient limitation, but in many models warming-induced increases in phytoplankton growth outbalance the nutrient effect. Temperature-driven increases in grazing and other loss processes cause a net decrease in biomass and NPP.

Short summary

Short summary

We investigate surface ocean pCO2 and air-sea CO2 fluxes climatological variability through biogeochemical modeling in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean. Surface ocean pCO2 spatio-temporal variability was found to be controlled mainly by temperature and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC). Biological production, physical transport and solubility are the main controlling processes. With different behaviors on subtropical and subantarctic open ocean, and on inner/outer continental shelves.

The CarboCount CH sites: characterization of a dense greenhouse gas observation network

Atmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 11147–11164, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-11147-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-11147-2015, 2015

Short summary

Short summary

We present a detailed analysis of a new greenhouse gas measurement network in the Swiss Plateau, situated between the Jura mountains and the Alps. We find the network's measurements to be information rich and suitable for studying surface carbon fluxes of the study region. However, we are limited by the high-resolution (2km) atmospheric transport model's ability to simulate meteorology at the individual measurement stations, especially at those situated in rough terrain.

Short summary

Short summary

Photosynthetic Dinoflagellates predominated in the surface, while potential parasitic Dinoflagellates and Ciliates dominated in the OMZ and deeper water in Costa Rica Dome. Total and active protists in the anoxic core were distinct from those in others depths. Reduced community diversity and presence of parasitic/symbiotic trophic lifestyles in the suboxic/anoxic OMZ suggests that oxygen deficiency could cause a change of protist community and the associated microbial food web as well.

Short summary

Short summary

Carbon isotopes have been added to the ocean model of the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). This paper describes the details of how the abiotic 14C tracer and the biotic 13C and 14C tracers were added to the existing ocean model of the CESM. In addition, it shows the first results of the new model features compared to observational data for the 1990s.

Short summary

Short summary

A compilation of photosynthesis-irradiance measurements from the Ross Sea, Antarctica, was analyzed for spatial and temporal trends, as well as the oceanographic factors that control the responses. The maximum, chlorophyll-specific, irradiance-saturated rate averaged 1.07+/-0.060 ug C per ug Chl per hour. Spring rates were 59% greater than summer rates. Irradiance, CO2, and iron had significant effects on rates. The effects of time need to be incorporated into models of Antarctic production.

Short summary

Short summary

This paper utilizes the SOCATv2 data product to calculate surface ocean pH. The pH data are divided into 17 biomes, and a linear regression is used to derive the long-term trend of pH in each biome. The results are consistent with the trends observed at time series stations. The uncertainties are too large for a mechanistic understanding of the driving forces behind the trend, but there are indications that concurrent changes in chemistry create spatial variability.

Short summary

Short summary

The observed seasonal cycles in atmospheric potential oxygen (APO) at five surface monitoring sites are compared to those inferred from the air-sea O2 fluxes of six ocean biogeochemistry models. The simulated air-sea fluxes are translated into APO seasonal cycles using a matrix method that takes into account atmospheric transport model (ATM) uncertainty among 13 different ATMs. Net primary production (NPP), estimated from satellite ocean color data, is also compared to model output.

Short summary

Short summary

The water column of the Landsort Deep, central Baltic Sea, is stratified into an oxic, suboxic, and anoxic zone. This stratification controls the distributions of individual microbial communities and biogeochemical processes. Our study of in situ biomarkers in the Landsort Deep provides an integrated insight into the distribution of relevant compounds and describes useful tracers to reconstruct stratified water columns in the geological record.
