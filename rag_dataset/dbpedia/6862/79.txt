The theme this month is we will love. Now that I have been at New Horizon Christian School for over a month, I am amazed at all the love I see in one place. I feel truly blessed to come to work here everyday. The love the teachers have for their students, and the love the students have for their peers is a remarkable thing to witness.

Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins. 1 Peter 4:8

Love,

Mrs.Malekovic
