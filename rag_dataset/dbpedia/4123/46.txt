STATEHOUSE – State Representatives Tom Saunders (R-Lewisville) and Cindy Ziemke (R-Batesville) were pleased to host students from Oldenburg Academy of the Immaculate Conception and St. Mary’s Catholic School Monday during a visit to the Statehouse.

“I always enjoy speaking with young Hoosiers about the legislative process,” said Rep. Saunders. “Understanding the democratic process is priceless knowledge, and getting the opportunity to help instill that is very important to me.”

More than 50 students visited both the House and Senate Chambers, met their local elected officials, toured the Statehouse and got to see session in action.

“It’s important for students to get a firsthand look at Indiana’s legislative system to understand how laws are made,” said Rep. Ziemke. “I always enjoy meeting with different groups from our community here in Indianapolis, and I was honored to have the opportunity to visit with them and answer questions about my work at the Statehouse.”

Oldenburg Academy was founded by the Sisters of St. Francis in 1851. With average class sizes of 18 high school students and a 100 percent graduation rate in 2011, the Academy was awarded a 4 Star School Status, the highest rating by the Indiana Department of Education from 2009-2011.
