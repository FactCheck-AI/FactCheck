Located in the North West of the island, Port Louis is the business and administrative capital of Mauritius. Port Louis was first occupied by the Dutch in the 17th century. It was then developed into a busy capital and strategic port in the Indian Ocean by the French Governor, Mahe de Labourdonnais, after the year 1736. It consists of mainly modern administrative buildings which house many businesses and shopping outlets. However, Port Louis still bears some heritage of its colonial past with its ancient Creole houses and stoned buildings, like the Post Office and Police Head Quarters, and other cultural sites, like the Aapravasi Ghat and the Theatre. You will be amazed by the beauty of this busy capital city. Start with a walk through the colourful fruits and vegetables of the Central Market. Do not miss a visit to the Dodo at the National History Museum. You also have the opportunity to have a beautiful overview of the city from La Citadelle (also known as “Fort Adelaide”). Your shopping will not be completed without a visit to Le Caudan Waterfront. The places to visit in Port Louis are numerous and the above are just a few of them. Therefore, do not miss to visit our capital during your holidays.
