From Thomas LANE of Jamestown, VA.

According to his own declarations Thomas Lane was born ca 1634 (between 3 Jan 1633 and 1 Feb 1635). His date of birth was determined from two conflicting depositions in Surry, Virginia:

Thomas Lane on 3 Jan 1670 made a deposition in which he gave his age as 36. This yields a date range of 4 Jan 1633 (if he was just shy of his 37th birthday) to 3 Jan 1634 (if he had just turned 36). [1]

Thomas Lane on 1 Feb 1674 made a deposition in which he gave his age as 39. This yields a date range of 2 Feb 1634 (if he was just shy of his 40th birthday) to 1 Feb 1635 (if he had just turned 39). [2]

These depositions did not indicate where he was born.

Thomas Lane has been suggested to be the son of Richard Lane[8], but there is no evidence to support that ancestry.

Richard Lane Lane (1610-1686 and wife last name Burwell. Richard's parents are Thomas Lane b. 1594, Bentley, England who married Alice Bagot. The documented proof are wills of Richard Lane, Thomas Lane and Land Abstracts and Deed Records, I would like his parents to be added to his tree, as they are my family.

A Thomas Lane is listed as living in Virginia in Elizabeth City 16 Feb 1623 https://archive.org/details/originallistsofp00hottuoft/page/194/mod... page 183

It has been proposed that this Thomas Lane was born in England. From ship lists, the most plausible would be Thomas Lane who was brought from England to the colony in 1653 by William Debnam.(9) It has also been proposed that he was born in Virginia, and was the son of parents that immigrated from England. Thomas Lane, age 30, who came to Virginia in The Treasurer in 1613; and Alice Lane, age 24, who came to Virginia in the Bona Nova in 1620 have been proposed as his parents.[3] However these are hypotheses and are therefore not included in this profile.

Some trees have him as the son of Richard Lane, of Lawnes Creek & Alice Lane without supporting evidence.
