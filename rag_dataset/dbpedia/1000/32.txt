Not the same as Thomas Lane of Surry

Thomas Lane from Long Bennington appears to have also married an Elizabeth (maiden name unknown) and this Thomas probably died in Long Bennington. His wife Elizabeth appears to have died in 1666 and he appears to have remarried to Mary Pacy.

He had three sons with his wife Elizabeth: Thomas born 1660, John born 1662 and died 1662, and William born 1663. All three were born in Long Bennington.

He also had some children with Mary Pacy.
