PIONEER LANE FAMILY

1. THOMAS LANE was born about 1768 in Devonshire, England. He married NANNY "Anna" STAMP. The couple emigrated to Hounsfield in May 1834, settling adjacent to the Washburns, Stoodleys, and Eveleighs -- all families that they would later become related to by marriage. Their place of residence appears on the 1855 land ownership map of the town but not on the 1864 map, probably indicating that none of the children occupied the property after Thomas' death in 1861.

In the 1850 federal census of Hounsfield, Thomas and Nanny were enumerated as the heads of dwelling number 232, family 232. Thomas reported his age as 79 and his occupation as farmer. Nanny was 75 and reported no occupation, possibly an indication that they both worked on the farm. They both reported their birthplaces as England. The value of their real estate at that time was estimated at $2,000.

Living with them was their daughter Jane Jeffrey, age 44, born in England, and her son, Duane, age 5, born in New York State. Also living in the same household and enumerated with the same family number were William Stokes, age 50, born in England, and his wife Ann, age 46, born in England, the daughter of Thomas and Nanny Lane. The ages of their children indicate that William and Ann did not emigrate until about 1842, a full 8 years after Thomas and Nanny.

THOMAS wrote his will on 15 January 1856 and it was witnessed by James Marsh and William "Stodley", his son-in-law. In the will he specifically mentioned daughters Ann and Jane and he assigned his son Charles to be sole executor of his estate. On 26 May 1862 the will was proved and each child of Thomas was required to give their full name and place of residence, thus providing a valuable resource for establishing this Lane genealogy.

THOMAS died 11 April 1861 at age 93 in the town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York, where he had been a farmer.

He married in or before 1801 in England

NANNY "Anna" STAMP who had been born about 1774 in Devonshire, England. She died 25 November 1857 in the town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York. They are both buried in the Sulpher Springs Cemetery on Sulpher Springs Road, Hounsfield. Their gravestones, in exquisite condition, stand half-way back from the road at the east end of the cemetery.

2. THOMAS LANE (son of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born 1801 in Dorsetshire(?), England, died 1887 in New York. Though they are not mentioned in Thomas of Hounsfield's will the best available evidence suggests that Thomas Lane, born 1801, may have been a first born son of Thomas and Nanny Lane. This Thomas emigrated about 1835, one year after Thomas and Nanny Lane and in the same year as Charles Lane, Thomas and Nanny's next eldest son. Thomas and Charlotte had a daughter, Sarah, who lived in Montague, Lewis Co., New York, while Thomas and Nanny had a son, James who also resided there. In addition, Thomas and Charlotte's descendants bear the names Charles, Ann, Sarah, Thomas, Amos, Henry and Peter, all names found among the other descendants of Thomas Lane and Nanny Stamp. Thomas Lane and Charlotte Williams were farmers.

She died 12 March 1871 "age 68 years", and is buried in Sulpher Springs Cemetery, town of Hounsfield, Jefferson Co., New York.

She married

WILLIAM STOKES of "Adams, Jefferson Co." who died 28 March 1871 "age 71 years", also buried in Sulpher Springs Cemetery with the inscription "Gone but not forgotten."

31 iv GEORGE STOKES

11. JANE LANE (daughter of THOMAS & NANNY/Anna (STAMP) LANE) was born about 1806 in England. She married Robert Jeffrey and they settled in Sackets Harbor. She received a legacy in her father's will of 1856, but she was noted as "a deceased daughter of said Thomas Lane" when the will was proved in 1861 when she would have been age 55. Her husband was not mentioned in the will and since he does not appear in 1850 and 1860 census records, and since their youngest son, Duane, had a court appointed guardian, it can be assumed Robert died or left the area soon after Duane's birth about 1845.

She married

ROBERT JEFFREY whose ancestry is unclear.

32 i SYLVANIA JEFFREY

33 ii ELIZABETH JEFFREY married SETH LARKINS of Henderson. She is mentioned in Thomas Lane's will and is probably Robert and Jane's daughter, since Thomas & Nanny already had a daughter named Elizabeth. Though surely a close relative, further research is needed to determine their connection.
