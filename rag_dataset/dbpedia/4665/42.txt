Hello, Eastwood Middle School families and community members,

It's hard to believe that we have ascended to the peak of the year and we are now closer to the end of the year than the beginning.

We are very pleased with the growth in maturity and work ethic from our students. They have truly embraced the challenge that we have placed in front of them. This is the time of year that we "grind" and prepare for the next level of learning. Skills and strategies have been the main focus to this point. Now, it is time for the application of these higher-level thinking and problem-solving skills. We are excited to see how high our students can perform.

This may be a difficult time for your child. It is challenging to find ways to expend movement energy with the weather this time of year, and academic homework and concepts are becoming more rigorous. Support them and encourage them to keep pushing forward. Keep communicating with your child's teachers should you see any concerns along the way. We want them to develop the necessary confidence and independence to be successful in their next endeavor.

Once again, "Thank you" to everyone in the Eastwood Family for your continued support in raising our "village". This is a community, and communication is the key. Please do not hesitate to contact me, should you have any questions or concerns.
