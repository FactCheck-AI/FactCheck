This is a compilation disc (without the disc).

This is our first compilation, Boutique Empire:Rec'10. It consists of thirteen songs by ten different artists. Primarily focused on the Vancouver electronic scene and the bands of Boutique Empire, it features the latest singles from Guilty About Girls and Combine the Victorious as well as the newly remastered "New City Anthem" from Sex With Strangers. Also making debuts on the compilation are songs from: Ten Suns, Ingrid Schroeder, Marc Wild, Gilles Zolty, Piper Davis, Chiwawa and Mince.

Boutique Empire is an artist's collective/record label from Vancouver Canada. We started in 2008 by bonding the output of three bands (Sex With Strangers, Combine the Victorious and Guilty About Girls) under one label. As of 2010 we now have six releases (including BE10006) from Boutique Empire. This compilation was a way for us to expose our latest works as well as give light to a few fellow artists who all have new and exciting music.

Ingrid Schroeder is a singer/songwriter from London England. Her history in the British music scene is well documented, with her solo album "Bee Charmer" released late 90's on East West. Ingrid has a brand new album "Love Runs Faster" - release date summer 2010..
