One of the top-grossing romantic comedies of all time, the affable Pretty Woman launched Roberts' career and popularized the modern romantic comedy. Despite its formulaic plot, the movie succeeds, due in part to J.F. Lawton's clever script and the performances of Roberts, Laura San Giacomo, and Hector Elizondo as the hotel concierge.

Provided that your teen is mature enough to recognize the implausibility of such a story, Pretty Woman is relatively harmless and surely will outshine the myriad of lackluster and unsubstantial romantic comedies teens normally submit themselves to. However, it's important to remind your child that the reality of prostitution is much harsher than its portrayal in the film.
