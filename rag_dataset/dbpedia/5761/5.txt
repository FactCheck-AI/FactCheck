While Switzerland is best known for its banking system and neutrality over the centuries, it also has a good number of amazing castles and manor houses. That said, since Switzerland hasn’t engaged in battle for 500 years, it’s not surprising they don’t have as many fortresses and castles as other countries. While their neutrality wasn’t cemented until many centuries later, it’s been a de facto neutral nation for centuries.

Interestingly, the nation ceased getting involved in battles and wars around the same time as its world-renowned banking system started to develop (16th Century). You gotta hand it to them; one way to stay out of costly wars is to secure money for many nations. Other countries won’t attack the nation that holds all the money.

Nevertheless, Switzerland does have a good handful of castles to check out. We set out the best castles below.
