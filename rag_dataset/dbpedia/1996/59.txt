Who are the world’s most successful Israelis? Who are the ones that excited us the most? And who broke conventions and paved new roads? To mark Yedioth Ahronoth Group’s 80th anniversary we have developed and produced “The People of Israel” conference”, that took place in ICC Jerusalem in January 2020 and was dedicated to those people who influenced us all.

The festive conference, hosted by media personality Sivan Rahav Meir and actor Aviv Alush, opened with a personal conversation with President of Israel Reuven Rivlin. This was followed by rich contents, delivered in dynamic, exciting and contemporary formats. For example, the event featured panel discussions on Israeli-international success and antisemitism, and a fascinating discussion with decorated IDF soldiers and officers who had shown remarkable courage in the battlefield. As part of the conference, the Yedioth Ahronoth Group awarded Rabbi Avraham Elimelech Firer with a medal of appreciation for his unique contribution to Israeli society through his widespread medical counseling and the “Ezra LeMarpeh” organization.

The conference also featured a hilarious comedy performance by Hanoch Daum, a mind-blowing presentation on the secrets of memory by game-show chaser Itai Hermann, performances by artists Ishay Ribo, Miri Mesika, Tal Ramon and Einat Sarouf with Akim Organization’s “Connected Vessels” musical group, and a fascinating exhibition that provided a glimpse into the work of the journalists, whose words and images compose our worldview. An event like this really happens only once every 80 years!
