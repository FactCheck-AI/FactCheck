The euro has the highest total value of notes and coins in circulation out of all of the world's currencies. It is the second-largest and second-most-traded currency globally, falling behind only the United States dollar. Like the U.S. dollar, each euro is made up of 100 centsâ€”however, euros and euro cents have different monetary values than do U.S. dollars and cents.

The European Central Bank issues the euro, which is available as banknotes and coins. Denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 euro are frequently used. Less frequently used are 200 and 500 euro banknotes. Coins that are commonly used in nations that use the euro are 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents, 1 euro, and 2 euro.

All 20 EU members that use the euro belong to the eurozone, an international economic alliance that also includes a few countries, such as Vatican City and Andorra, that are not EU members, but which have nonetheless adopted the euro as their official currency. The eurozone had a collective population of approximately 341 million people as of January 2022. A number of non-eurozone countries have also adopted the euro or made plans to do so.
