4.2.1 Elements of crime writing

In the case of Elements of crime writing, many of the texts pre-date the crime fiction genre that emerged as a recognisable literary genre in the mid-19th century and with academic recognition in the 20th century. However, in all the texts a significant crime drives the narrative and the execution and consequences of the crime are fundamentally important to the way the text is structured.

All set texts are narratives which focus on transgressions against established order and the specific breaking of either national, social, religious or moral laws. The focus in this component must be on ‘Elements’ and students need to consider the elements that exist in each of their texts. The elements that might be explored, depending on the individual text, include:

the type of the crime text itself, whether it is detective fiction, a post-modern novel, a revenge tragedy, an account of a life lost to crime

the settings that are created as backdrops for criminal action and for the pursuit of the perpetrators of crime: both places and times will be significant here

the nature of the crimes and the criminals, the criminals’ motives and actions

the inclusion of violence, murder, theft, betrayal

the detection of the criminal and the investigation that leads to his or her capture or punishment

how far there is a moral purpose and restoration of order

guilt and remorse, confession and the desire for forgiveness

the creation of the criminal and their nemesis, the typical detective hero

the sense that there will be a resolution and the criminal will be punished

the victims of crime and the inclusion of suffering

the central motifs of love, money, danger and death

punishment, justice, retribution, injustice, accusation, the legal system, criminal trials and courtroom dramas, imprisonment, death

the structural patterning of the text as it moves through a series of crises to some sense of order

the specific focus on plotting

the way that language is used in the world that is created; there may be use of a criminal register, legal register, police register

the way that crime writing is used to comment on society, particularly the representation of society at particular historical periods

ultimately, how crime stories affect audiences and readers, creating suspense, repugnance, excitement and relief.

Students study three texts from the following list: one post-2000 prose text, one pre-1900 poetry text and one further text.
