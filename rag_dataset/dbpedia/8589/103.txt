US COMPUTER company Dell is splashing out $3.9 billion on Perot Systems, the information technology company founded by two-time US presidential candidate Ross Perot.

The agreed takeover is intended to broaden the hardware manufacturer’s services arm, enabling it to provide all-round packages and consultancy to big business clients. It echoes a recent deal in which rival Hewlett-Packard bought Electronic Data Systems – another company founded by Mr Perot.

Based in Texas, Perot Systems was established in 1988 by Perot, a former IBM salesman, along with eight associates. Among the first computer services companies of its kind, the firm’s growth made Perot a billionaire, helping him to bankroll independent pushes for the White House in 1992 and 1996.

The firm, which employs 23,000 people, generated sales of $2.8 billion last year. It employs about 250 people in Ireland.

Mr Perot (79) remains chairman emeritus of Perot Systems and his son, Ross Perot jnr, is chief executive.

The younger Perot said: “When my father founded Perot Systems he envisioned a global information technology leader. The new, larger Dell builds on that promise and its own successes by taking Perot Systems’ expertise to more customers than ever.” – (Guardian service)
