Hugh Jackman will star in an as-yet-untitled Woody Allen project, reports Variety.

Also starring in the movie are Scarlett Johansson, also appearing in Allen's Match Point, and Ian McShane (Nemesis Game).

The director is quoted as saying of the movie: "The film is a comedy melodrama that is contemporary and takes place in London. Johansson plays a visiting American student who has a love affair with a British aristocrat. I play a low-grade American entertainer, which is perfect for me because that's what I am."

Shooting will begin in London on 27 June.
