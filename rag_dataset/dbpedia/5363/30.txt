Description

Step on the gas and hit the dirt in Sega’s HUMMER, an exciting on or off-road racing game where monster sized vehicles are the star of the show. No need to worry about gas prices or mileage here!

Officially licensed from General Motors (GM), this includes authentic 3D Hummer models for users to pick and race. Each of the four closed-circuit tracks are designed to get the most out of such a versatile vehicle, featuring fantastic jumps for catching massive air and a plethora of obstacles to smash into for building up your boost meter. Lock-on and attack enemy Hummer’s to gain the advantage in the race.

Sega’s HUMMER was released in three different cabinet designs: Standard (32″ screen), Mini-Motion Deluxe (42″ screen, two steering wheels per cabinet) and Super Deluxe Motion (40″ screen, two steering wheels per cabinet).
