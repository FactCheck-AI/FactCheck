The Groninger Museum auctions exhibition banners with iconic David Bowie images for cancer charity (KWF Kankerbestrijding) through Catawiki.com

There is the famous Alladin Sane portrait with thunderbolt, the iconic Striped Yamamoto bodysuit for the Aladdin Sane tour, Bowie in Pierrot outfit for the Ashes to Ashes Tour and Bowie in Union Jack coat for The Earthling.

The auction of the banners starts on Friday 13 January around 12 AM and closes at 20 January 2017 at Catawiki.com.
