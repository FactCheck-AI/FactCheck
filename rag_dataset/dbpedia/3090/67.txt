Home to Gray Line Westcoast Sightseeing’s Welcome Centre, the award-winning Canada Place is a marvel of sustainable architecture. Formally known as the Vancouver Convention Centre, the space consists of the East Building located within Canada Place and the West Building immediately adjacent to it. In total, this point of interest boasts an impressive 43,340 square meters (466,500 square feet) of meeting space. The West Building is LEED Platinum certified, and its 24,000 square meter (6 acre) living roof is regularly irrigated with the building’s wastewater.

Sixteen art installations can be found on and around the grounds, including “Digital Orca” by Douglas Coupland and “The Drop” by Inges Idee. Additionally, there are more than 60 interpretative panels that depict stories of the province spanning indoor walls and across the seawall. Created by John Gray, these panels bring to life both single events and significant figures from British Columbia’s history.
