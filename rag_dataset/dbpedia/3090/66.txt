Canada Place, built for Expoâ€™86, was a primary pioneer in the redevelopment of the Vancouver waterfront. It houses the Vancouver Trade and Convention Centre, the cruise ship terminal, and the Pan Pacific Hotel. Canada Place also housed the first permanent IMAX 3D theatre as part of the Expo. It closed in 2009 and was replaced by FlyOver Canada

The 514-room first-class hotel contains restaurants, retail, meetings rooms, entertainment lounges and gardens. A fitness club, spa, and a roof top pool and hot tub overlooking the northshore enhance guest experience.
