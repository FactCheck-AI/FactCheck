Located in the heart of downtown Calgary, Canada Place was constructed by CANA in 1976. This tower is 18 stories high and has a total area of 195,000 ft², with two levels of retail space and +15 connections to neighbouring buildings. The building is clad with warm orange Ironspot bricks. Bronze is used in the interior of this structure to bring continuity to the building’s colour scheme.

An open lobby with a grand staircase showcases a spacious entrance into this building. Energy conservation was a significant concern for this large office tower, with mechanical, electrical, and lighting systems developed having both aesthetics and conservation in mind.
