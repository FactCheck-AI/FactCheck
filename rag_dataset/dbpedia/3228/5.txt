Does your child seem to spend all their time under water during their time at the pool? Then Octopush might be the sport for them!

Octopush is otherwise known as ‘Underwater Hockey’ and is a fun team game which involves passing a puck along the pool floor to score a goal at the opposite end of the pool. If you are aged 8+and can swim 50m on your front and back then contact your local Octopush club for more information.
