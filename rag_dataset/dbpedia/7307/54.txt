The Nordic Investment Bank (NIB) has signed a 15-year USD 40 million (EUR 38 million) loan agreement with Icelandic bank Landsbankinn hf. for financing their new BREEAM Excellent certified headquarter building in Reykjavik, Iceland.

The loan constitutes long-term financing of the construction of Landsbankinnâs new headquarters, located in the old harbour district AusturhÃ¶fn in central Reykjavik. Construction has been ongoing since early 2019 and the building is expected to be ready for move-in during the first quarter of 2023.

The building will be environmentally certified and is expected to achieve an Excellent rating according to the international BREEAM classification. The loan project is eligible to be funded with NIB Environmental Bond proceeds.

The new building has a total size of 16,500 square meters of which the NIB financed new headquarters for Landsbankinn will occupy 10,000 square meters. The new headquarters allows Landsbankinn to relocate all its central operations under one roof with modern premises. The building provides flexible and open workspaces that support new working methods and closer collaboration within the bank.

Since 2015, NIB and Landsbankinn have cooperated successfully on three loan programmes providing financing for Icelandic SMEs and environmental projects.

Landsbankinn hf. is the largest universal bank in Iceland. The Bank was established in 2008 with a history going back to 1886. It is majority-owned by the Icelandic State Treasury.

NIB is an international financial institution owned by eight member countries: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden. The Bank finances private and public projects in and outside the member countries. NIB has the highest possible credit rating, AAA/Aaa, with the leading rating agencies Standard & Poorâs and Moodyâs. www.nib.int
