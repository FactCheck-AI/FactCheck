Are there any ancestors alive today? I worked for a beginning producer in the late 90's, he wore a ring with a family crest on it & he said it was from his mother's side. I pressured him about his history & he was very secretive. We traveled a lot and I knew he had come from serious money. The most I could get out of him was that he had roots in France, he was Roman Catholic & his mother had died. He would be in his middle to late 40's today. I've searched & searched for his name & I can't find a thing. I don't think he used his "real" name although the name I knew him by is listed on IMDB. Just in case somebody reading this can think of something or will want a little more, I can say his first name (which is probably his true first name) is Michael. He divides his time between LA & NY. (And Europe?) Any ideas? TIA.

A correction - Prince Michael is not a 1st cousin of Constantine and Sofia. He is the 1st cousin of their father, the late King Pavlos, and also a 1st cousin of the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip. Pavlos, Philip, and Michael are all grandchildren of King George I of Greece.

Also, Michael is 77 years old and he is Greek Orthodox.

James de Bourbon-La Marche and Jeanne de Châtillon had 2 sons Peter II, Count de La Marche and his younger brother John,Count of La Marche and of Vendôme.Peter briefly succeeded his father as Count for a few weeks in 1362 and was then succeeded by his brother John.John had married Catherine de Vendôme in 1364,who in inherited the countdoms of Vendôme and Castres in 1374 following the death of her brother.Both John and Catherine were buried at the now destroyed Collégiale Saint-Georges de Vendôme.

Thanks An Ard Ari!

When I see a name of a location or title I've never heard of, like Prince of Dombes, it sparks my curiosity. Thanks to your post I found that Dombes was an independent principality all on its own with a capital and its own mint until one of the princes gave it to the crown.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dombes

...The eldest son of the duke of Maine, Louis-Auguste de Bourbon (1700–1755), prince of Dombes, served in the army of Prince Eugene of Savoy against the Turks (1717), took part in the War of the Polish Succession (1733–1734), and in that of the Austrian Succession (1742-1747). He was made colonel-general of the Swiss regiment, governor of Languedoc and master of the hounds of France. He was succeeded, as prince of Dombes, by his brother the count of Eu, who in 1762 surrendered the principality to the crown.

Charles II (1523-1590) was not only Duke of Bourbon. He was a French cleric and cardinal.
