Australian actor Sam Worthington is to star in a mystery based on the true story of two detectives who probed a series of gruesome murders in Texas, Daily Variety reported Monday.

Worthington, the star of science fiction blockbuster "Avatar", will play one of the detectives in the film "Texas Killing Fields," which is to be directed by Ami Canaan Mann.

The movie is based on the investigation into the murder or disappearance of as many as 60 people in the industrial wastelands surrounding oil refineries on the Gulf Coast.

Worthington will play a local homicide detective who works with a cop transplanted from New York to try and solve the crimes.

Worthington will next be seen in Warner Bros epic remake "Clash of the Titans" due for release in North America in April.
