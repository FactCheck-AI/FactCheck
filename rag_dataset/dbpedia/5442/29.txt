This is an original, French moyenne theatrical movie poster from 1972 for Conquest of the Planet of the Apes starring Roddy McDowall, Don Murray, Ricardo Montalban, Hari Rhodes, and Natalie Trundy. J. Lee Thompson directed the science fiction sequel. Art by Boris Grinsson.

The poster measures 23" x 31" and is in very good to excellent condition with minimal wear on the top edge from previous handling. Please note that the black smudge on the bottom left of the poster is part of the artwork and not damage. The poster was folded at the time of printing but has been stored flat for many years. It will be rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.

Please look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image.

This rare and collectible poster, printed in 1972 to promote the French theatrical release of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
