A stunningly restored version of Akira Kurosawaâ€™s Japanese epic, Ran was the most expensive Japanese film ever made on its release in 1985. Spectacularly beautiful, with gorgeous, colour-saturated frames, it is an undoubted masterpiece; the product of a breathtaking artistic vision that works as an historical epic and Shakespearean adaptation as well as a bloody, action-packed war film with a silent central battle scene that must be seen to be believed.
