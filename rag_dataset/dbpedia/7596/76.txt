In the 2010/11 season FC Barcelona and Real Madrid faced off in three different competitions, the La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League. Today, for the first since the start of 1997/98 season an El Clasico will determine the winner of the Supercopa de Espa√±a, the Spanish Super Cup.

This match-up marks the fifth time one of the biggest rivalries, if not the biggest rivalry, in the world will decide who will take home the first trophy of the season. Barcelona booked a spot in the competition by winning the Spanish League while Real Madrid did so by hoisting the King's Cup. Only once before have the two eternal rivals entered the Super Cup with Barcelona adding a league title and Real winning the Cup. On the other three occasions Real were crowned champions of Spain and Barcelona lifted the Copa del Rey.

But no matter who won which trophy the year before the result of the Supercopa was always the same. It was won by Real Madrid.

Unlike in other major football leagues in Europe, the Super Cup is in Spain played over two legs resulting in eight games played between the rivals over the course of history. Five games have been won by the Los Blancos while in only two the victorious side were the Blaugrana; one game ended in a draw. Real Madrid also holds a comfortable lead in goal difference, scoring 17 and conceding 8.
