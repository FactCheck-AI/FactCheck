The 27-year-old is apparently dating actress Gabriella Wilde – the 23-year-old daughter of wealthy businessman John Austen Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe.

Gabriella, whose real name is Gabriella Zanna Vanessa Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe, starred as Constance opposite Olando Bloom in last year’s film The Three Musketeers.

The former St Swithun’s School pupil has also had acting roles in Doctor Who.

Reports in the national press revealed that Gabriella lives in Basingstoke.

But our research shows that her family home is actually in Martyr Worthy, Winchester.

Do you know Gabriella?
