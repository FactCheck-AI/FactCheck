Gabriella Wilde (aka Gabriella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe) has amazing legs and hair we'd die for. She's been in Tatler for years - parties, polo matches, balls, fashion shows - you name it, Gabriella was probably there. Since making her debut in our glossy pages, she continued modelling before kicking-in her fine art degree to act, surprising everyone with her superb turn in The Three Musketeers. Gabriella is BFFs with fellow willowy blonde Tamsin Egerton and is a die-hard Michael Jackson fan.
