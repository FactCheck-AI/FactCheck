Hank Williams’ brief but impactful career as a country-western singer is chronicled in Director Marc Abraham’s I Saw the Light.

I Saw the Light, starring Tom Hiddleston as Hank Williams and co-starring Elizabeth Olsen as Audrey Williams, charts the rise and fall of the legendary country-western singer-songwriter, along with the tragic effects of fame on his personal life.

Following the DGA screening in Los Angeles on March 27, 2016, Abraham spoke about the challenges of bringing this story to the screen in a conversation moderated by Director Peyton Reed (Ant-Man), highlighting his casting of Tom Hiddleston and Elizabeth Olsen, his rehearsal process, and the complications of making a film with musical sequences.

In addition to I Saw the Light, Abraham’s work includes the feature film Flash of Genius starring Greg Kinnear, Dermot Mulroney and Lauren Graham. He has been a member of the DGA since 2007.
