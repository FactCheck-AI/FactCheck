Spotted Rains Brighten

Agricultural Outlook

jjpi

1$

Heavy rains fell in spotted

areas of Llano County at various

times throughout the last several

days.

Most of the rains were report-

ed to have fallen “just right”

with little or no run-off. Ranch-

ers were in town early this week

comparing notes on the rainfall,

and farmers were finding their

cropland too wet to work.

The heaviest rain reported was

about 44 inches which fell north-

west of Valley Spring Monday af-

ternoon. Valley Spring itself had

about 3.70 inches since Saturday,

most of which fell in several good

showers. “I have never seen such

good rains at this time of year,”

Mrs. W. M. Buntyn said.

Three inches were reported

from the Shirley Willims ranch

at Granite Shoals Lake since Mon-

day, coming in two rains of about

14 inches each; The Kassel

Moseley ranch south of Castell

received 4 inches since Saturday,

“a wonderful rain that really puts

our pastures in good shape for a

while.”

Mrs. Belle Smathers said she

had received 2.60 in spotted rains

but “they were just what we

needed.”

Amounts ranging up to almost

three inches fell in a downpour

in the Cherokee area Tuesday af-

ternoon.

In the city of Llano, only 1.01

inches were recorded during the

past week with .99 falling Mon-

day and .03 on Tuesday. The high

temperature in Llano for the past

week was only 94 with a mini-

mum of 66 degrees on Monday

morning.

Mark A. Moss reported that

only .65 inches fell at his house

in the Oxford area; however, at

the south side of his ranch, .90

inches fell; and at the home of

Mrs. A. F. Moss, there was 1.20.

He said that most of the water

tanks could still hold more water.

The good amount of pasture veg-

etation held the water and kept

it from running into the tanks,

or from running off the land,

Moss said. He had 16.85 inches

during the first six months in-

cluding 9.60 which fell in June.

The Colorado River was on a

moderate rise above Lake Buch-

anan early this week and the

Lower Colorado River Authority

officials said Lake Buchanan was

expected to continue to rise slow-

ly for several days from rains

which fell through most of the

Colorado River watershed this

week and the Utter part of last

week.

$57,259 Incentive

Wool Payments Made

A total of 146 Llano County

wool and lamb producers have

received $57,259.62 in incentive

payment for wool and unshorn

Iambs recently.

Of this amount, $56,192.83 was

paid for wool to 116 applicants;

and $1,066.79 was paid for un-

shorn laambs to 30 applicants.

The amount of payment varies

from year to year and depends

upon the national average of

shorn wool. The recent payments

were much higher than last yeaar

because of the lower wool price.

Congress has established an in-

centive level for both wool and

mohair and when the national

average drops below the establish-

ed level, a percentage required

to bring the national average up

to the incentive level is applied

to the net amount received by

each producer.

An incentive level of 62 cents

for wool and 70 cents for mohair

has been set for the 1959 market-

ing year which runs from April

1, 1959 to March 31, 1960.

shooting of Fay M. Bourland, 42,

Saturday night.

Bourlaand died instantly after

having been shot once in the

chest and once in the shoulder

with a .38 caliber Colt revolver.

The shooting took place in an

outhouse behind Gage’s residence

in northeast Llano, about 10:55

p. nv

Immediately after the shooting

Gage went to a neighbor’s house

and called officers, according to

Constable Lee Moran, . who in-

vestigated. Moran said he and

Deputy City Marshal Jake Mer-

kel were patrolling the city when

they saw the red emergency light

on the east side of the square

flash on. They went at once to

the Gage residence, where Gage

handed Moran the revolver and

surrendered without resistance.

Bourland’s body was found on the

ground just outside the outdoor

toilet where he was shot. Justice

of the Peace E B Morrison ren-

dered a verdict of death by gun-

shot wounds. Gage was arrested

and lodged in the county jail un-

til Sunday afternoon, when he

waived examining trial and post-

ed $3,500 bond. He was then re-

lePed pending action of the

grand jury which will convene

November 2.

Sheriff Leonard Turbiville said

the altercation between Gage and

Bourland was the result of an old

grudge Sheriff Turbiville and

Deputy Billy Johnson were on

patrol duty in the lake area when

the emergency call came in.

Moran said powder burns on

the dead man’s shirt indicated

that both shots were fired at

close range. He was dead when

officers arrived at the scene.
