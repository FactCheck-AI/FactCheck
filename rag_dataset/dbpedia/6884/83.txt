Legendary actor, producer and director Robert Redford received the career tribute award, Etoile dâ€™Or, at the 18th edition of the Marrakech International Film Festival in the Moroccan city yesterday.

Redford, 83, started his acting career in Broadway with a starring role in Sunday in New York, and later in Neil Simon's Barefoot in the Park, which was later turned into a film.

He received his first Oscar nomination for Best Actor in The Sting (1973), which went on to win seven Oscars.

His directorial debut in film was with Ordinary People (1980), for which he received the Directors Guild of America Award, a Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Director. In 2002, the actor received his second Academy Award for Life Achievement.

Redford also founded the Sundance Film Festival, one of the most prominent festivals in the world today.

The Marrakech International Film Festival also paid tribute to Prinyanka Chopra Jonas, French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, and Moroccan actress Mouna Fettou.
