Say "Ahoy, mate" to a possible new Pirates of the Caribbean hottie!

Australian actor Brenton Thwaites, 25, is in "final negotiations" to play Henry, a British soldier, in the upcoming fifth film in the franchise, which will be filmed in Australia in 2015, The Hollywood Reporter said on Friday. Walt Disney Studios, the series' distributor, has not commented.

The 25-year-old actor would join returning star Johnny Depp, who reprises his role as Jack Sparrow again, and the outlet compares the younger star's character to Will Turner, who Orlando Bloom had played in the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Thwaites has also not commented. The fifth movie is set for release on July 7, 2017.

Thwaites recently starred in the sci-fi movie The Giver, appearing with Jeff Bridges, and played Prince Phillip in Disney's Maleficent, starring Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning. He also appears in Son of a Gun with Ewan McGregor.
