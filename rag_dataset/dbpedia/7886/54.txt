Another hot Aussie import hits our shores! We welcome to the Studio the dreamy Brenton Thwaites, who stars in the romantic Lifetime flick 'Blue Lagoon: The Awakening'! After only being in the States a short time, he is already on a first-name basis with Hollywood's A-List, thanks to being cast in Disney's 'Maleficent', starring Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning! Brenton also tells us what items he would want with him on a deserted island and tries hard to keep it clean for the kids. Hosted by Nikki Novak.
