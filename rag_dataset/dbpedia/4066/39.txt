Subdivision surveying is used to prepare a subdivision plat. This plat is used for housing development projects, as well as when owners wish to sell portions of their properties. Subdivision surveying consists of boundary surveys to ensure the property is subdivided in the correct manner. While housing developments are the most common use of subdivision surveying, it may also be used for parents who wish to give their children a portion of their Heber City property. Subdivision surveying is comprehensive in the fact that research must be completed, as well as many different survey types.
