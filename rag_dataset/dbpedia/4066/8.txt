Heber City has begun a process of simplifying and updating our Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances. Over the next 9 months many changes will be introduced to improve the consistency within the ordinances, to repeal unused or redundant ordinances, to comply with recent State Law requirements, and to improve the quality of the ordinances. All changes will require a properly noticed Public Hearing with the Planning Commission and a subsequent adoption by the City Council.
