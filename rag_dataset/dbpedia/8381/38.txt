‘THE MORECAMBE & WISE CHRISTMAS SHOW 1970’

Please feel free to comment on my review.

The second Christmas Special is better than the first one. It also features some guest stars that I recognise. I always feel I want to connect to a guest star I recognise watching these Christmas Specials.

The guest stars in this Christmas Special are as follows. There are actors Peter Cushing, William Franklyn, Eric Porter and Edward Woodward; actress Ann Hamilton; singer Nina and Kenny Ball and his Jazzmen.

In this episode, Peter Cushing, a well-known versatile actor who played Dr Who in the Dalek films, returns to ask Eric and Ernie for money. He hasn’t been paid since the last show he worked with them.

William Franklyn guest stars with Eric and Ernie in an amusing play of ‘The Three Musketeers’ as well as Ann Hamilton. I enjoyed it when Eric made fun of William Franklyn mucking up his lines at times. 😀

Edward Woodward sings the Fred Astaire classic ‘The Way You Look Tonight’ from the 1936 film ‘Swing Time’. Eric Porter also returns to do his sing-and-song dance routine with Eric and Ernie in this episode.

I found it funny when Eric Morecambe through gritted teeth whispers to Ernie about Eric Porter. “Get rid of him! He was awful!” It was also funny when Eric Porter and Eric Morecambe had the same name.

‘The Morecambe & Wise Christmas Show 1970’ rating – 7/10
