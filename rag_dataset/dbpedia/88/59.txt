DURING the winter months, many Americans will see a lake effect snow warning issued ahead of a storm.

As winter snow storm and blizzards warnings are issued in the United States, citizens can expect to see lake effect warnings.

What is lake effect snow?

Lake effect snow is common during the winter months, especially in the Great Lakes region.

Lake effect snow typically occurs when cold air moves across the open waters of the Great Lakes, which includes Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake Michigan Lake Huron, and Lake Superior.

"The air rises, clouds form and grow into narrow band that produces 2 to 3 inches of snow per hour or more," according to the National Weather Service.

The cold air often comes from Canada, which is known for its colder temperatures during winter.

What is a lake effect snow warning?

Ahead of winter storms, the National Weather Service will issue a lake effect snow warning.

A lake effect snow warning warns residents that heavy snowfall accumulations are expected based on recent forecasts.

The warning is often issued when the weather may pose a hazard or is life-threatening.

What do you do during a lake effect snow warning?

Lake effect snow warnings are no reason to panic, however, there are things that you can do when one is issued to better prepare yourself for the upcoming snowfall.

During these warnings, it is best to avoid travel and keep your cars off the roads so there is room for plows to get through.

If you must travel, it is recommended to keep a winter survival kit with you, in the event that you get stranded as travel may become difficult or impossible in some situations.
