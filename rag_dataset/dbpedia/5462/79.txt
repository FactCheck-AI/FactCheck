Fanboys and fangirls of Drive-Thru Records’ posse of almost supernaturally young bands will get plenty of bang for their buck from this jam-packed collection. The set sports a bounty of music videos by such label acts as Something Corporate, New Found Glory, Home Grown, Senses Fail, the Early November and the Starting Line. But the big bonuses come in the extras, which include live full-band performances captured in California, New Jersey and England; a wealth of intimate acoustic material; a photo gallery; interviews with the Drive-Thru groups’ unaffected, often wacky and sometimes potty-mouthed members; and backstage footage. A lot of the music here—most of it in a post-Green Day/Offspring punk or pop-punk vein—is not especially distinguished or distinctive, but devotees definitely get their money’s worth.—CM
