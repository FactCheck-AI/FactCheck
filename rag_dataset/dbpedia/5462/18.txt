Siblings Richard and Stefanie founded Drive-Thru Records in 1996 with no financial backing, no experience, and one credit card. The siblings discovered and developed then-unknown bands, who became gold, platinum, and multi-platinum acts, including New Found Glory, Something Corporate (Andrew McMahon), Steel Train (Jack Antonoff â€“ FUN. / Bleachers), Dashboard Confessional, The Starting Line, hellogoodbye, The Early November, Senses Fail, Finch, Midtown and The Movielife. With over 7 Million record sales across the globe, Drive-Thru became a well-known international brand. Over 25 years later, much of the roster is still actively touring worldwide.

The Reineses put the label on hold to manage bands and release music under the War Road moniker. Their current roster includes Nothing But Thieves, The Million, Airways, The Roads Below, and Fox Royale.

The War Road roster has amassed over 2 Billion streams and sell out shows around the globe.
