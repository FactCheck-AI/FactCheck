Remember that time Fall Out Boy and Gatsbys American Dream almost joined that label. Those were the days.

DTR was a great label despite how awful the owners could be

Would anyone be interested in going in on pressing a custom “best of drive thru” vinyl with me???

SIDE A:

midtown - get it together

the starting line - the best of me

new found glory - hit or miss

the movielife - hand grenade

senses fail - bloody romance

home grown - you're not alone

SIDE B:

allister - somewhere on fullerton

the early november - i want to hear you sad

fenix tx - all my fault

finch - letters to you

something corporate - konstantine

Holy crap what a record

What was the deal with Drive Thru & Geffen records, and why did it end up screwing the likes of TSL, Finch, NFG, etc?

I remember TSL mentioned it in their Somebody's Gonnna Miss Us DVD.

I always heard the strangest things about this label. A friend of mine met with the owners who I think were a husband and wife(?). They had them lie on their backs and gave them massages while they pitched why they should sign with them. lol

This is true and a thing that really happened to bands at the time
