The View celebrated the 25th anniversary of Sister Act by reuniting Whoopi Goldberg, Kathy Najimy, Wendy Makkena, and Harvey Keitel. They all reminisced about making the 1992 film along with the music supervisor, Marc Shaiman, who crafted the catchy religious songs for the nuns to sing.

Whoopi Goldberg revealed that the film was to originally star Bette Midler but joked, “They kind of went to I guess like 100 million people and then got to me.”

Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena had a little fun wearing their nun costumes. The two ordered room service to their hotel room and Najimy played porn on the TV for the attendant to see while delivering the food. Maggie Smith sent a nice message to the cast, and Harvey Keitel recalled a story about Whoopi Goldberg getting creative with avoiding swearing during the movie.
