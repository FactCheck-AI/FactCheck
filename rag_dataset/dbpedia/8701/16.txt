Notable Judgements

In Bilkis Yakub Rasool v Union of India (2024), a two-judge Bench of Justices Nagarathna and Ujjal Bhuyan struck down the remission granted by the Gujarat government to 11 convicts in the Bilkis Bano gang rape case. Justice Nagarathna authored the judgement. The Bench held that the remission was illegal as the Gujarat government was not the appropriate authority to grant premature release. As the conviction was issued by a Special Court in Maharashtra, the appropriate government would have been Maharashtra. The judgement reiterated that the state government considering remission should be the state where the accused was convicted, and not the state government where the convict was imprisoned.

In Neeraj Dutta v State (Gov of NCT of Delhi) (2023), Justice Nagarathna authored the unanimous opinion which held that a public servant could be convicted for bribery on the basis of circumstantial evidence under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PCA). The judgement significantly reduced the higher degree of proof required to convict an official for seeking bribe as it gave weightage to circumstantial evidence in absence of direct evidence.

In Kaushal Kishore v State of Uttar Pradesh (2023), she authored a concurring opinion in a five-judge Constitution Bench judgement which held that the grounds to restrict free speech under Article 19(2) are limited and exhaustive.The Bench also held that a government is not accountable for views expressed by its ministers. The case was pertaining to a speech made by Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan pertaining to the Bulandshahr rape case.
