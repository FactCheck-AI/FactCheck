Marlene Dietrich’s artistic estate, acquired in 1993, is among the most notable elements of the Deutsche Kinemathek’s Archives. The extensive collection provides nearly gapless documentation of the actress and singer’s life and career. The archive has preserved over 300,000 pages of written material related to her personal and private affairs, including more than 45,000 pages of correspondence, 16,500 photographs and over 3,300 textile objects. These are available for viewing at the Deutsche Kinemathek.

We are now exhibiting a portion of the Marlene Dietrich Collection Berlin online, with photos from Marlene Dietrich’s childhood in Berlin, photographs of her volunteer work during World War II and numerous costumes and costume designs.

The generous support of the Berlin Senate Committee for Culture and Europe and the Förderkreis des Museums für Film und Fernsehen has allowed us to digitize roughly 1,500 objects from the archive in 2017 and 2018. The work was undertaken with the aid of the research and competency center of digitization Berlin (Forschungs- und Kompetenzzentrum Digitalisierung Berlin). The catalog of estate items available online is intended to grow continually, with the bulk of the corpus coming through photos, 3D and textile objects whose legal status for online presentation has been clarified.

If you are interested in other materials or topics, you can contact us here in the Archive about the possibility of viewing the originals. We look forward to your visit.

Marlene Dietrich’s extensive estate has been housed at the Deutsche Kinemathek since 1993. The entire archive is completely indexed and secured and has been at least partially digitized. New collections are also being acquired on an ongoing basis to expand our holdings. The collection can be viewed upon advance registration with the Deutsche Kinemathek. Certain prominent or highly notable items have been put into the permanent exhibition for viewing. We look forward to your visit.
