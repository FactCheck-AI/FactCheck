Some of the most iconic and memorable Black films are, no doubt, romance flicks. They tell unique stories of Black love that incorporate aspects of the African American experience, like navigating the complexities of a society driven by racial stereotypes and how that impacts their interpersonal relationships. And sure, they tend to cast some of the same celebrities time and time again, but they also serve another purpose: these diverse films often steer toward sweet, happy endings, which may not always be realistic, but are precisely what we need after a year like 2020.

So, grab a blanket, snuggle up with your loved ones, and stream some of these feel-good flicks from Brown Sugar and Poetic Justice to The Photograph and Moonlight. Some may be little-known, and others have won Academy Awards, but they're all worth a watch. Here are 17 of the best Black romance movies available to stream now.
