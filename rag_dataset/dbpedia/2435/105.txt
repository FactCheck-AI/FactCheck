We are thrilled to welcome bestselling author, Rose Tremain, to the Authors’ Club to talk to John Walsh about her latest novel, Absolutely and Forever, and her glittering career.

A perfect Tremain novel… English, dark and yearning… Remarkable… Tremain shows us the things that make every human life extraordinary. The Times

How do you find the courage to make your own life? Absolutely and Forever is an electrifying novel about first love set in 1960s London.

Marianne is fifteen when she falls helplessly in love with Simon. Simon owns a Morris Minor, is in his final year at school and has a dazzling future ahead of him. Desperate to escape the stifling 1950s suburbs she has been raised in, Marianne feels sure she will be able to find true happiness with him.

However a twist of fate sees Simon’s glittering future dashed and with it Marianne’s dreams. He flees the country and Marianne, realising she will have to make a life of her own, moves to London determined to reinvent herself. But Marianne cannot let go of that first all-encompassing love, while Simon is in Paris, nursing a secret that will alter everything.
