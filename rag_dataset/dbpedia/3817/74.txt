The Independent State of Samoa is made up of nine volcanic islands, two of which - Savai'i and Upolu - make up more than 99% of the land.

It was governed by New Zealand until its people voted for independence in 1961. It has the world's second-largest Polynesian group, after the Maori.

Samoa's society centres around the extended family, headed by an elected chief who directs the family's social, economic and political affairs, and the church, which is a focus of recreational and social life.

The economy revolves around fishing and agriculture, which is vulnerable to cyclones and disease.

Attempts at diversification have met with success. Tourism is growing, thanks to scenic attractions and fine beaches. Offshore banking spearheads an expanding services sector. Light manufacturing is expanding, and has attracted foreign investment.

Despite this, many younger Samoans are leaving for New Zealand, the US and American Samoa. Money sent home by Samoans living abroad is a key source of household income.

Some key dates in Samoa's history:
