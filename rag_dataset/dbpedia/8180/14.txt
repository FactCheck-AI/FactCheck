Jim Allen, nicknamed "Jimmy Wildcat" is most well known for his 30 year reign at Newark High School, first as a coach, then later as the athletic director.

Jim was born in Norwich, Ohio. He began his own career as a versatile athlete at New Concord High School excelling in football, basketball, baseball and track, before continuing his football career as a halfback-quarterback at Muskingum College. He also served two years in the U.S. Navy . He began his teaching career in 1948 at Denison High School, before moving to Newark High in 1952. There he served as the head basketball coach from 1957-1961, winning the Central District tournament championship in 1960, before becoming the head football coach in 1961, and athletic director in 1962. He resigned as head football coach in 1967 to focus solely on his position as athletic director, which he kept until he retired in 1982. [1]

April 3rd, 1982 was declared "Jim Allen Day" in Newark and Licking County to honor his retirement and contributions to the community as coach and athletic director. The Newark High School gymnasium was also renamed the 'Jim Allen Gymnasium' in his honor. [2]
