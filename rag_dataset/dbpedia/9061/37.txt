The Long Ryders were the founders of Alt-country, a musical genre which did not exist before they burned so brightly in the eighties, and are a key link in the Americana chain, uniting Gram Parsons’ Flying Burrito Brothers with Wilco, The Black Crowes and The Jayhawks.

In 1984, their indie LP Native Sons was the #1 alternative/College radio album in the USA, and the held the #2 spot on the UK’s indie charts. Their next album was State Of Our Union, featuring the classic single, Looking For Lewis & Clark.
