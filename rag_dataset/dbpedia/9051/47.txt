A powerful voice from a delicate woman, Paula Cole has a style and presence to her musical delivery. She brings 17 years of music history in her back pocket, including her memorable part in Peter Gabriel’s Secret World tour of 1993, and chart topping hits “Where Have All the Cowboys Gone” and “I Don’t Want to Wait,” later a Dawson’s Creek soundtrack. She has charted her own unique career course, and is as authentic a performer as you will find. She visited Wolfgang’s Vault in 2010 and treated us to the three great songs presented here.
