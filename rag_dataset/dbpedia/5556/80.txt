Religious ignorance leads to the involvement of citizens in the radical religious groups, Azerbaijani State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations Chairman Hidayat Orujov said.

"It's no secret that the republic should carry out extensive work on the religious education of citizens. Part of our citizens have come under the influence of radical religious groups, non-traditional religions and sects in connection with religious unenlightened, which is also a source of prejudice. Shortcomings of religious ignorance are also manifested in matters associated with the organization of weddings and memorial services, " Orujov said in an interview to the official website of the ruling New Azerbaijan Party (NAP).

The country also observes growth in number of early marriages for girls, he said.

"Unfortunately, many people associate it with religion. But this is superficial approach. The marriage of girls, who did not even graduate the secondary school, is organized upon the parents' initiative. Experience shows that the family established at an early age is destroyed after a short time. Therefore, secondary schools, society, the relevant bodies of executive power, and, of course, religious leaders must seriously consider the matter and express their position on this issue. Religious leaders should guide by the Caucasian Muslims Office's calls on this issue. Besides all this, I want to note that the activity of religious students gives us a basis to look ahead with optimism," Orujov added.
