Over the millennium, religious tolerance has been established, friendly inter-religious dialogue exists in Azerbaijan and the services of the ex-President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev in strengthening the tolerance have been invaluable, the Head of the State Committee for Work with Religious Organizations, Hidayat Orujov, stated while making a speech at the opening ceremony of the bust statue of the national leader His Excellency Heydar Aliyev on the eve of the 3rd Anniversary of his death.

Azerbaijan is a former Soviet state, but has not deviated from its religion, Orujov said. According to him, although most of the population is Muslims, other religions also exist peacefully in Azerbaijan. The representatives of various religious communities respect the rights of other religions, Head of the State Committee stated.
