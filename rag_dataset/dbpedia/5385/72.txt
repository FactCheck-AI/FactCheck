Summary

Lin Zexu (1785-1850) was a Chinese scholar and official during the late Qing dynasty. He is most famous for his fight against opium smuggling in Guangzhou, China. In 1838, Lin was sent to Guanadong to halt the importation of opium by the British. He confiscated more than 20,000 chests of opium and supervised its destruction during a 23-day campaign beginning on June 3, 1839 in Humen China. This action is usually considered to be the primary catalyst for the first Opium War (1839-1842) between Britain and China. In recognition of his valiant fight against narcotics and British invasion, Lin is highly respected in the history of China as national hero.
