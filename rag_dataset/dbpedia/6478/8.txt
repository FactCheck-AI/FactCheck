Lift passes

If you are a member of the Seibu Prince Club, you can get ¥500 off a 1-day lift pass. Suginohara is also notable for having free passes for children 12 years old or under. Also, their definition od senior is generous—anyone 55 or over.

In addition to passes, there are single use tickets for each of the gondola (¥1,500), regular lifts (¥500), and high speed lifts (¥1,000).

Getting there

Suginohara Onsen is about a 15 minute car journey from Myoko Kogen Station (don’t even think about walking), which is the terminus of both the Shinano Line, which runs from Nagano Station, and the Myoko Haneuma Line, which runs from Joetsu-Myoko Station. Both Nagano Station and Joetsu Myoko Station are on the Hokuriku Shinkansen. Nagano Station is closer to Tokyo, but depending on connecting trains, transferring at Joetsu-Myoko can sometimes get you there earlier. The journey on a Hakutaka service via Joetsu-Myoko takes about 3 hours and costs ¥9,580 for a one-way trip. Via Nagano on an Asama service, the trip takes 2 hours and 40 minutes and costs ¥8,660 for a one-way ticket.

You can also use the Japan Rail Pass or regional JR East passes.

From outside the station, Kogen Taxi can take you to Myoko Suginohara for about ¥3,400. If you make prior arrangements, there are larger taxis (seating up to 9 people) that can take you to the resort for ¥4,700.

If going by private car, the journey from Tokyo will take from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 hours depending on traffic and conditions. During winter, you should have chains or snow tires for the roads closer to the mountain. From the Joshin-etsu Expressway, take the Shinanomachi or Myoko-Kogen Interchange exits.
