The Sotaki Waterfall resides behind the Tsubame Onsen village near Myoko in the Niigata Prefecture.

We actually trusted Google Maps a bit too much when we visited this place and wound up going to a dead-end at a closed tunnel so I’m going to describe how we should have done this drive from Nagano.

From Nagano, we’d drive towards the E18 expressway at the Suzaka-Naganohigashi IC, and then go north on the E18 for about 38km to the Myokokogen IC exit.

We’d then take the exit towards the Route 187, where we’d turn left to continue on this road towards Myoko and the Route 399 in another 1.8km.

Next, we’d follow the Route 399 north for about 2.7km (going through Akakura Onsen) before turning left onto the Route 396.

Then, we’d follow the Route 396 for a little over 3km before turning left onto Route 39.

Finally, we’d follow the Route 39 towards the car park for Tsubame Onsen for about 2.8km.

This car park seemed pretty big when we visited though the foul weather may have impacted visitation, but I can see this place filling up at busier times of the year (e.g. the Autumn).

Thus, an early start would definitely be a good idea if you wish to spend time here.

By the way, if you blindly follow GoogleMaps, it’s going to try to take you up the other side of Route 39 from Akakura Onsen.

Unfortunately, after driving 4km up the narrow and steep winding road, we were thwarted by a closed off tunnel and had to go back to Akakura Onsen.

This was a classic example of why you can’t always trust GoogleMaps for routing because every so often you go on joy rides like this.

While the software thinks it’s doing you a favor taking you the shortest distance route, I’ve found that we’ve often wasted time and piece of mind unnecessarily on narrow roads or dead-ends!

Indeed, we wound up driving for more than 1.5 hours from Nagano to Tsubame Onsen following GoogleMaps, but if we had gone the way suggested above, then the drive would have only been a little over an hour.
