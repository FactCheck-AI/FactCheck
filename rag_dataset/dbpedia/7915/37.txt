A star of the silent screen and his little-known links to Bristol are to be explored as part of a film festival.

While the city is well-known for Hollywood connections through Cary Grant, Bob Hope, and Deborah Kerr, less is remembered of Nigel de Brulier.

Film fans will be able to learn more about him on 29 July when the Watershed Cinema features his 1923 film Salome.

Born Francis George Packer in Frenchay in 1877, Mr de Brulier later emigrated to the United States of America.

He then embarked on an illustrious screen career, starring in more than 100 films over three decades.
