Are three voices better than one? In Tribalistas, the joint album by independently successful Brazilian artists Arnaldo Antunes, Carlinhos Brown, and Marisa Monte, the answer would have to be yes—simply because each of them has managed to retain their individual voices while at the same time achieving a cohesive and gorgeous whole. From the delicate, almost ethereal “Anjo da Guarda” and “Mary Cristo” to the joyous opening track, “Carnavalia,” Tribalistas is a delight (all tracks are co-writes among the three). Often whimsical, this set works by balancing Monte’s vocals with the baritone and deep bass of her male counterparts and then adding a cornucopia of acoustic instrumentation for harmonic and ambient effect. Infinitely Brazilian, Tribalistas is nevertheless utterly sophisticated, and, yes, accessible enough to have become a chart-topper in Brazil.—LC
