Walt Disney has acquired Tapulous, the maker of the popular iPhone play-along music game Tap Tap Revenge.

Steve Wadsworth, president of the Disney Interactive Media Group, confirmed the deal with The Associated Press on Thursday.

Wadsworth says the acquisition was a strategic move that highlights the Walt Disney Co.'s focus on developing games on mobile device platforms such as Apple's iPhone and iPad.

Tapulous' small staff will remain at the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., which Wadsworth says is a benefit of the deal.

He did not disclose the terms of the arrangement.

Tapulous founder and CEO Bart Decrem and Chief Operating Officer Andrew Lacy will take on mobile business development roles at Disney as part of the deal.
