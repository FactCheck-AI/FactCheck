Abstract: This collection is the creation of Ione K. Wiechel, a bookplate collector, and includes over 2000 bookplates from various book owners.

Biography of Ione K. Wiechel: Ione K. Wiechel, of Van Wert, Ohio, was an avid bookplate collector for over fifty years. From 1930 to 1980, Wiechel built up her collection of bookplates to its present size of over 2000 examples, with her most active years of collecting between the 1940s to 1960s. Wiechel kept most of these bookplates in spiral notebooks and adhered them to paper, often including her own personal notes of each piece's provenance. Wiechel died in 1982.

Scope and Content: This collection contains six cubic feet of bookplates collected by Ione K. Wiechel, along with a few pieces of correspondence relating to these bookplates.

Statement of Arrangement: The bookplates are arranged alphabetically by owner's last name. Notes in brackets are basic descriptions made by Ione K. Wiechel as to the provenance of each item. The plates were mounted and displayed by the creator in roughly alphabetical order.

Preferred Citation: Ione K. Wiechel bookplate collection. Department of Special Collections and Archives. Kent State University Libraries.

Acquisition Information: Ione K. Wiechel's bookplate collection was donated to Kent State University Special Collections by her daughter, Ellen Amstutz, in 1985.
