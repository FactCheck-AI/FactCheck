Veliko Tarnovo: Historical Marvels

Former Capital City

Unearthed by archaeologists, Veliko Tarnovo reveals evidence of a thriving settlement dating back to the 3rd millennium BCE, solidifying its status as one of the oldest cities in Europe. The layers of history embedded in its soil speak volumes about the enduring legacy of this ancient town.

Veliko Tarnovo experienced its zenith during the 12th century when it gained independence from the Byzantine Empire. This period marked the town’s golden era, flourishing for approximately two centuries until succumbing once more to Turkish occupation.

In a pivotal turn of events, the town regained its freedom in 1877, becoming the capital of Bulgaria for a brief yet significant two-year span before relinquishing the title to Sofia. This tumultuous historical journey shapes Veliko Tarnovo into a compelling destination, where each cobblestone and fortress wall whispers tales of resilience and transformation across the ages.
