David W. Parks entered Carleton in fall 1976. He was a star tennis player at his high school and at Carleton. He also enjoyed travel, and had been to Russia, Europe, & the Far East. His ambition was to attend law school. At Carleton he worked doggedly toward that goal even though, since fall of 1979, his health forced him to take several leaves of absence. David left the campus for the last time in November 1981. He died of cancer at his home in Belleville, Illinois, on January 31, 1982.

When initially created, the Parks Fund supported the History Department’s collection of films for teaching, which we still have and use: David W. Parks Film Collection.
