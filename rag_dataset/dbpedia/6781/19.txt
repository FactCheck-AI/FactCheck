He is day dreaming, it's not possible to archive $185 billion in 2020. It may be around $95-$115 billion.

These kind of over inflated stats coming from govt sources needs to be taken with a massive pinch of salt.. Some of those numbers given are near fantasies

Being pragmatic is one this but this is just over the top

What are the current figures? Sri lanka is doing good in terms of GDP growth rate. Concentrate on trade and infrastructure more.
