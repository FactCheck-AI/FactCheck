Computing giant Dell has finished its acquisition of network security firm SonicWALL, Inc, expanding its software and service portfolio. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

SonicWALL, Inc. also provides secure remote access, email security, backup and recovery, and management and reporting.

“Customers who are looking for simplified and comprehensive security solutions will benefit from the addition of SonicWALL to our software portfolio,” said John Swainson, president, Dell Software Group. “The combination of SonicWALL with Dell’s existing security offerings and broad market reach will help customers securely manage their data, securely manage consumer devices being brought into their enterprise, and securely expand their applications to the cloud.”

Matt Medeiros, president and CEO of SonicWALL, said the deal provides SonicWALL with great growth opportunities for its security offerings.

“We believe that taking this step with Dell is a logical progression for our business. The new Dell SonicWALL will offer customers security and channel advantages beyond anything currently available,” Medeiros said.
