Take flight with Robert Altman’s surreal fantasy Brewster McCloud, the next entry in our Remembering Shelley Duvall series!

Brewster is an owlish, intellectual boy who lives in a fallout shelter of the Houston Astrodome. He has a dream: to take flight within the confines of the stadium. Brewster tells those he trusts of his dream, but displays a unique way of treating others who do not fit within his plans. While a young tour guide befriends Brewster and tries to get to know him better, the Houston police struggle to solve a sudden rash of strangulation murders.

A quirky comedy with a pronounced dark streak, Brewster McCloud is one of Altman’s most delightfully strange films.
