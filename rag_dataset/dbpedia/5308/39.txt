Smoke DZA, Wiz Khalifa, and Curren$y are all fairly close friends and affiliates. The three are also known for their shared love of marijuana; two of the three made our list of Best "Get High" Rappers Right Now. And yet somehow, the three have never come together for a collaboration. Until today.

Rocking over soulful production from Harry Fraud, Wiz and Curren$y appear on DZA's "Legends In The Making (Ashtray Pt. 2)." The song is the sequel to DZA's song "Ashtray" from last year, which had appearances from ScHoolboy Q and Domo Genesis. All three rappers ride the beat with smooth, deliberate flows as they talk about their passion for the herb. Wiz also throws out a barb at labels in light of all his past success, saying, "And labels tryna make the old me/But I'm the only one that own me."

"Legends In The Making (Ashtray Pt. 2)" is the first single off DZA's Dream Zone Achieved, due out next year. DZA is also working on Rugby Thompson 2, the sequel to his project with Fraud that came out last year.
