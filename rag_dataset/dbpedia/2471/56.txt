The Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 (English: War Cross) is a French military decoration, the first version of the Croix de Guerre. It was created to recognize French and allied soldiers who were cited for their service during World War I, similar to the British mentioned in dispatches. See Wikipedia:Croix_de_guerre_1914–1918_(France).

For the similar medal awarded by Belgium, see Category:Croix de Guerre 1914-1918 (Belgium).

The additional devices denote:

bronze star (étoile de bronze): for those who were mentioned at the regiment or brigade level.

silver star (étoile d'argent): for those who were mentioned at the division level.

silver gilt star (étoile de vermeil): for those who were mentioned at the corps level.

bronze palm (palme de bronze): for those who were mentioned at the army level.

silver palm (palme d'argent): represents five bronze mentions.

Currently there are sub categories for each of these 5 types. If you have a profile that just says Croix de guerre, add it to this roll up category.

The are too many combinations possible to create a sub category for each, so there is no sub category for multiple awards at the same level, i.e. with 2 bronze stars, so place that profile in the with bronze star sub category.

if a person was awarded different levels, i.e. with silver palm and bronze star, add to both subcategories with silver palm and with bronze star.
