This time percentage calculator allows you to determine the percentage of one period of time compared to another.

How to use the calculator: Enter the two periods of time you wish to compare and click on the "Calculate" button to obtain the results.

Formula

Time Percentage (%) = ( Time A [sec] / Time B [sec] ) × 100

Where:

Time A [sec] = Seconds + 60 × Minutes + 3600 × Hours + 86400 × Days

Time B [sec] = Seconds + 60 × Minutes + 3600 × Hours + 86400 × Days

Example: What percentage of 5 minutes is 30 seconds?

There are 300 seconds in 5 minutes (60 sec × 5 = 300 sec.)

Divide 30 seconds by 300 seconds, and you get 0.1, which is equal to 10%.

As such, 30 seconds is 10% of 5 minutes.

Conversion Factors

1 min = 60 sec

1 hour = 60 min = 3600 sec

1 day = 24 hours = 86400 sec
