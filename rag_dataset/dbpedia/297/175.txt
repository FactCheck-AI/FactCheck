For the first tournament in the series, see GENESIS.

GENESIS is a tournament series held in California. It is widely regarded as one of the most prominent and prestigious tournaments in the entire competitive Smash scene.

History[edit]

The inaugural 2009 tournament featured both Melee and Brawl, and was organized by the DBR crew. GENESIS 2 was held two years later. It is particularly infamous for an incident where DBR accused crew-member Zelgadis of attempting to steal $6,000 in sponsorship money from the prize pool.[1] Zelgadis issued a statement in 2015 reflecting on the situation.[2]

In 2016, GENESIS 3 was announced following a 5-year hiatus and featured Melee, Wii U, and 64. To the community, this served as a replacement for the Apex tournament series following the numerous controversies surrounding Apex 2015.[3][4]

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there was no tournament held in 2021. GENESIS 8 was similarly postponed from January 2022 to April 2022 due to pandemic concerns.[5]

Melee[edit]

Melee has been a mainstay of the tournament series since its inception. It is the only Smash game to be featured in every edition of GENESIS.

The nine year rivalry between Armada and Mango notably began at GENESIS, where both players met for the first time. The two players continued to meet in four consecutive iterations of GENESIS Grand Finals. Ultimately, Armada won three of these tournaments, while Mango took one.

64[edit]

For 64, GENESIS was once considered one of the most important tournaments of the year, second only to Super Smash Con. The announcement of GENESIS 3 was very well received.[6] This tournament also marked the return of Isai, who had not played in a tournament since Apex 2014. GENESIS 3 was a great success for the 64 commnuity, with the event attracting over 200 entrants. From GENESIS 3 to GENESIS 6, arragements were also made to fly out international talent such as wario from Japan, or Alvin from Peru.

Community sentiment soured after GENESIS 6. Starting with GENESIS 7, 64 Top 6 was no longer included in the Sunday lineup, meaning the game would not appear on the main stage. This perceived slight prompted both community leaders and top players to pass on the event.[7] The importance of GENESIS in 64 plummeted as a result, with virtually no top players attending the tournament from 2020 onwards.

Doubles Circuits[edit]

On February 18, 2017, GENESIS announced Genesis FUSE, a Melee doubles circuit.[8] Points were awarded to teams as opposed to individual players to encourage the formation of static teams. Due to difficulty in gathering the qualified players, the circuit finals were held as a side event at EVO 2017. Community reception of the overall circuit was mixed.[9]

Season 2 of the Genesis FUSE doubles circuit was announced on July 27, 2017.[10][11] This iteration included both Melee and Wii U. However, this circuit was ultimately abandoned.
