Legendary director John Ford's quiet, loving study of character, family, and community is a moving portrait of a place in time and the people who lived it. Ford's been widely reported as saying that How Green Was My Valley was his favorite film, and it's easy to see why. Wonderful performances from the large cast of colorful characters, a hauntingly beautiful landscape artfully photographed in black and white, and a moving, sentimental story with just the right touch of bittersweet make it a great family choice.

As wonderful as it is, it's not likely to attract or hold the interest of the younger kids. The slow, quiet pace, lots of singing (in Welsh), and adult issues like hardship, unionizing, loveless marriage, and religious hypocrisy will go over their heads. Tweens and up will enjoy seeing the story through young Huw (sounds like "Hugh") Morgan's eyes. Don't be surprised if you, and they, need to reach for a tissue a time or two as the bonds of family, faith, and community are tested and proven strong.
