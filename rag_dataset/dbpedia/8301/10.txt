Apache Mesos is an open-source project to manage computer clusters. Telegraf is a plug-in driven server agent for collecting and sending metrics and events from databases, systems and IoT sensors.

To send your Prometheus-format Apache Mesos metrics to Logz.io, you need to add the inputs.mesos and outputs.http plug-ins to your Telegraf configuration file.

For Windows

After downloading the archive, extract its content into C:\Program Files\Logzio\telegraf\.

The configuration file is located at C:\Program Files\Logzio\telegraf\.

For MacOS

The configuration file is located at /usr/local/etc/telegraf.conf.

For Linux

Ubuntu & Debian

The configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.

RedHat and CentOS

The configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.

SLES & openSUSE

The configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.

FreeBSD/PC-BSD

The configuration file is located at /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf.

First you need to configure the input plug-in to enable Telegraf to scrape the Apache Mesos data from your hosts. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

After you create the configuration file, configure the output plug-in to enable Telegraf to send your data to Logz.io in Prometheus-format. To do this, add the following code to the configuration file:

Replace the placeholders to match your specifics. (They are indicated by the double angle brackets << >>):

Replace <<LISTENER-HOST>> with the Logz.io Listener URL for your region, configured to use port 8052 for http traffic, or port 8053 for https traffic.

Replace <<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> with a token for the Metrics account you want to ship to. Look up your Metrics token.
