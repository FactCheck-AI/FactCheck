Anthology Film Archives will be screening Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead and John Goras’ Award winning Chirpy on Friday, January 14th, 2012 at 9:00 PM. Lloyd Kaufman, President of Troma Entertainment, Creator of The Toxic Avenger and Producer, Writer and Director of Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead, will be appearing in person as well as Chirpy creator, John Goras.

Anthology Film Archives is shelling out an Eggs-cellent program with this screening, which can be considered something of a Thankschrismakawanzayears Day (with an egg on top) gift to all of Troma’s feathered and plucked fans. First, Anthology will be presenting Chirpy, a film Oscar Nominated animator Bill Plympton described as “one of the sickest animated films ever made.”

They will then continue the evening with Kaufman’s critically acclaimed Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead. Nathan Lee of the New York Times had the following to say about Poultrygeist: “Within the context of its genre – the satirical sexploitation zombie chicken gross-out musical extravaganza – it is just about as perfect as a film predicated on the joys of projectile vomiting and explosive diarrhea can be…Poultrygeist plays like a grindhouse analogue to the sloppy, psychosexual provocations of the performance artist Paul McCarthy and is, in its lowbrow way, every bit as liberating.” That’s nothing to shake your tail feathers at.

If that wasn’t enough egg-citement for you, there will also be a Q&A with the two films’ creators and plenty of “clucked-up” Troma merchandise available, all of which the ruler of the roost, Lloyd Kaufman will sign free of charge. Beak there or be square.
