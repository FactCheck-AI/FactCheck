Poet

Adrian Pãunescu and Grigore Vieru are the most prominent Romanian contemporary poets, in a natural distinction of their creative power and friendship which united them beyond death.

Pãunescu's poems as "Rugã pentru pãrinþi", "Jurãmînt la Putna", "Clopotul Reîntregirii", "Jurãmînt pentru Ardeal", "Colindul Ardealului", "Trãiascã România", "Doamne, ocroteºte-i pe români" [Prayer for Parents, Oath at Putna, Recompletion Bell, Oath for Transylvania, Transylvania's Carol, Long Live Romania, God, Bless the Romanians] are known by all Romanians in this Country, as well as from nigh and from afar, and have left their consistent mark while shaping a historical period.

Adrian Pãunescu wrote enormously, being the most prolific Romanian contemporary poet.

Flacãra Cenacle, Totuºi Iubirea Cenacle

To the national conscience Pãunescu stays as the initiator and soul of the Flacãra [Flame] Cenacle, a cenacle which lauched many talents, brought beautiful songs to light, shaped the taste of Romanians toward Romanian music, for poetry, for folk genre (especially), strengthened the feelings of national pride. Flacãra Cenacle attracted numerous valuable artists and musical groups from the entire Romania: ªtefan Hruºcã, Vasile ªeicaru, Mircea Vintilã, Tatiana Stepa, Valeriu Sterian, Anda Cãlugãreanu, Vanghele Gogu, Nicu Alifantis, Victor Socaciu, Gil Ioniþã, George Nicolescu, Cristian Buicã, Ion Hagiu, Adrian Jacotã, the men's chorus from Finteuºu Mare, the Choir of Bocsig but many others also.

The concerts of the cenacle were performed on sports stadia all over the country, inasmuch as no auditoriums existed spacious enough for those fascinated by the Flacãra phenomenon. As a personal mark, Pãunescu would recite the verses while songs were being sung, and so thousands of spectators were being involved into rendering humongous improvised choirs together with the artists.

Come into being in 1973 and bearing the name of the magazine to which Adrian Pãunescu was chief editor, the Cenacle reached a huge popularity at the beginning of the 80's, being terminated by the authorities in 1985.

A new cenacle, Totuºi iubirea [Nevertheless the Love], was founded by the poet after the Romanian revolution of 1989, this time also succeeding in attracting valuable artists and poets, this time already accomplished, as Tudor Gheorghe, Grigore Vieru, Nicolae Dabija, Ion and Doina Aldea Teodorovici, Grigore Leºe, Maria Gheorghiu, Mircea Rusu, Andrei Pãunescu.

After Adrian Pãunescu

After the shift of regime in 1989, Pãunescu was blamed for supporting president Nicolae Ceauºescu, a support that had actually existed in the time of economic prosperity and cultural thaw of the regime.

On the political background of indiscriminate negation of the entire Ceauºescu period, Adrian Pãunescu was denigrated through press campaigns, his value was contested, his poetry was withdrawn from schoolbooks in Romania.

After his passing on, as lasting consequence, a limited number of busts were raised in his memory in this country, generaly in discrete places only. The memory of the poet has received a maximal esteem on the Alley of Classics in Chiºinãu, the Republic of Moldova, were Pãunescu's bronze countenance stands next to the classics of the Romanian literature, in the Central Park of Municipium - capital city.

The poetry left from Adrian Pãunescu has patrimonial value, is actual and lives in the Romanian conscience - a monument he built by himself, being the most durable of all.

Basarabia

Adrian Pãunescu was born on the 20th of July 1943 at Copãceni, in the county of Bãlþi, in Basarabia. Today the village of Copãceni is included in the rayon of Sîngerei. Fled over River Prut with the family as refugees of war, Adrian spent his childhood at Bîrca, in the county of Dolj, in grandparents' house.

As poet he dedicated poems to the Moldavia of Stephen the Great, in a period during which the word Basarabia, the province where he was born, was taboo.

Adrian Pãunescu supported the national rebirth in the Moldavia beyond River Prut. During the defence war waged on River Nistru by the independent Republic of Moldova with Transnistrian separatists Adrian Pãunescu has organized, together with poet Grigore Vieru and artists Ion and Doina Aldea-Teodorovici, several patriotic spectacles for Moldavian volunteers defending their heritage.

One of his deepest afflictions, the alienation of Basarabia, is marked in his poem "Basarabia pe cruce" [Basarabia on the Cross], with testamentary import.

Basarabia keeps to him a live gratitude, unbiased by prejudice, which climaxed with the issuing by the National Bank of Moldavia of gold and silver coins bearing its countenance.

Politician

After 1989 Adrian Pãunescu involved himself into politics, for twelve years being a senator for the Romanian left wing.
