Article published in February 2001 “Oh La” number 127 about Jean-Pierre Aumont funeral that was celebrated the 6th February 2001 in French church of Saint-Roch.

Among the guests there were Tina Aumont, her half brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Aumont, her step-mum Marisa Pavan, her uncle François Villiers, her cousin Aruna Villiers, French actor Alain Delon (pictured with Tina and behind her a close friend of hers, Patrick Gunter), singer, actress and AIDS activist Line Renaud (pictured with Tina Aumont), actress and dancer Leslie Caron, film and stage actor and director Pierre Mondy, actress Nicole Courcel and actor Daniel Ceccaldi with his wife Laurence are some of the people pictured in this magazine.

Very special thanks to @74paris for sending me this article.

15th January 1962 - Lovely family portrait showing Jean Pierre Aumont and his offspring: teen Tina, not yet 16; Jean-Claude Aumont, not yet 5 years old; and little Patrick Aumont, who was nearly 2.

Photo either sent to me by Andrea Montez or from ebay.

Here you have Tina Aumont's Family Tree, a Family Tree that it's in constant growing.

The sources I checked are these ones:

Jean-Pierre Aumont family tree (you can go up to 1787)

Árbol Genealógico de Isidoro Gracia García (you can go up to 1465!)

"De María África a María Montez, un mito en Technicolor" documentary

"Enrique Meneses, un flash" article in Spanish from Orsay magazine

Regla María Teresa Vidal at Geni, at Familysearch and at Ancestry

*Very special thanks to Dominic Fuentes, @74paris and @shannendoherty-fans for their help.

If you know any details or have some photos from the family that aren't posted here, please send them and I will credit you.

NOTE: Isidoro Gracia García (Tina's grandad), had two sisters: Tomasa and Gaudencia, in the documentary I saw both were mentioned but it was displayed only a single photo, that's why I posted the same photo in both women. When new info comes to light, I will update it.

Thank you very much!

Thanks to @74paris I could add Mara Villiers photo. She was François Villiers wife, and she was of Indian ascendent. Her real name was Jeanine Rikh but in lots of press articles she was called Jean or Mara - familiar name after the Indian goddess - she took the Villiers surname when she got married to François Villiers.

By watching the photo first I thought she looked a lot like María Montez, and the fact is that The Queen of Technicolor was the muse to lots of women of her family and also helped them a lot to have a beautiful and glamorous style.

Here is the full photo showing Jeanine Rikh and her husband François Villiers, Jean Giono, Andrée Debar and Claude Clert at Cannes Film Festival, May 1958. (Photo by Keystone-France/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images - Jeanine Rikh is not identifyed in this Getty Images photo)

In this family tree I also added Marisa Pavan’s date of passing.

Remember that this family tree is updated when I have new information, so please, feel free to share links, websites, books, any knowledge that you have. Your halp is going to be credited. Thank you very much!!

Updates:

Added Joaquín Gracia Anadón’s parents dates of birth and passing.

Added Dominic Fuentes brother (although there’s no name nor date of birth)

Added Patrick Aumont’s wife (although there’s no name nor date of birth)

Added Patrick Aumont’s daughter, singer and musician Lola Aumont

Updated the sources.

Not sure if Dominic Fuentes mum is a single child or maybe she has a brother as you can see in this pic, Maria Isabel is the little girl in front of Jean Pierre Aumont and maybe the boy is her brother called Aquilino just like his dad… [Photo from María Montez, Su Vida written by Margarita Vicens]
