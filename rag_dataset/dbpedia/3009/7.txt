The fall of David Lloyd George

 DLG was selling peerages like knighthoods in returns for political funding. He sold roughly 15,000 knighthoods in 6 years.  He gave newspaper owners peerages so that they would not publish his malpractice and in 1922, gave peerages to people with criminal convictions.  This was published in the press and DLG was disgraced  DLG tried to drag Britain into the Chanak crisis in 1922, after Turkey broke a peace treaty when they tried to gain control of the Dardanelles. This would have impacted British trade in the area.  The conservatives in the coalition and the public did not want this as they had just experienced mass loss of lived due to WW1 and did not want this to happen again.  The conservatives left the coalition after a meeting in the Carlton Club in 1922.  David Lloyd George and the liberals never got into power again.
