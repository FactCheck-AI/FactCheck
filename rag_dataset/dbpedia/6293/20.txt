LMU second-year head men's tennis coach Tom Lloyd announced today that Adam Zaorski will compete for the Lions this spring. Zaorski is a native of Poland, coming to LMU by way of Lazarski University in Warsaw.

"Adam is an extremely talented player that has all the tools," Lloyd said. "We are very excited to have the opportunity to add Adam to the 2015 roster, and I look for him to make an immediate impact. With the addition of Adam to our roster, we continue to add a great amount of depth to our lineup moving forward."

Zaorski earned a silver medal at the U18 national team championships, and was a finalist in the U16 division at the prestigious Anna Dolinska Memorial Tournament. The talented 6'2 player, who carries a top-20 junior ranking, also registered section championships in singles and doubles at the U14, U16 and U18 levels. Zaorski, a humble native of Sopot, Poland, credits all of his success to his parents.

In his inaugural year at LMU, Lloyd guided the Lions to a 14-10 overall mark, including a 9-4 record at home at the LMU Tennis Center. The 14 wins, which were the most since 2006 for LMU, more than tripled the win total from the year prior (4).
