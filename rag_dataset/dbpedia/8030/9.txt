Mal Peete has created a wonderful novel in this reincarnation of Shakespeare's Othello in EXPOSURE. It's exciting and modern with lessons beyond Shakespeare's original tragedy. Peete touches on poverty, political corruption, the extreme world of celebrity media, and racial tensions that bubble along the undercurrents of modern society. The author's characters are familiar, warm, and sympathetic. Teens will fall in love with some, hope for others, and rage against several. The conflicting settings -- the hyper world of celebrity sport and pop stars and the desperate poverty of Brazilian slums -- creates a believable, rich, layered environment that only enhances the story. The novel has a pressing, emotional quality to it, making the audience feel like they're always on the edge of a character's breakdown or breakthrough, which makes for an intense, thrilling read.

There are a few drawbacks. The novel's length combined with the sometimes slow pace may discourage teens. Also, those unfamiliar with the story may not understand the subplots, and those who have read Othello may be underwhelmed by a conclusion that doesn't take the tragedy as far as Shakespeare's original.
