Hidden Gems

Mystica Music presents another gem in the series of Hidden Gems- inspiring hidden talents, Raghunandan Panshikar. Born into a lineage of Sanskrit scholars and classical musicians, as son of the eminent Marathi stage actor and producer Prabhakar Panshikar, Raghunandan Panshikar's aptitude for music was recognized and fostered from an early age. At 11, Raghunandan began his formal study of music in Mumbai under the tutelage of the late Pandit Vasantrao Kulkarni. Six years later, he commenced training with the doyen of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, Gaan Saraswati Smt. Kishori Amonkar. Over the next 17 years under Kishoriji's keen guidance, he worked painstakingly to imbibe her complex and unique musical style through rigorous daily riyaaz. During this time, Raghunandan was also fortunate to learn from Kishori-ji's mother & guru, the late Gaan Tapaswini Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar, who learned directly from the late Sangeet Samrat Ustad Alladiya Khan, founder of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana. By training with both Mogubaiji and Kishoriji, Raghunandan achieved an authenticity in many aspects of the Jaipur-Atrauli style - a full throated akaar, dazzling taans, a sophisticated use of techniques such as meend and gamak, and a clever grasp of the intricacies of layakari. This album is a mesmerizing collection of Raga Yaman, Raga Rageshri and Hori by Raghunandan Panshikar.
