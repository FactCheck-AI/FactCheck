Bill Eadie: "It was well known that Randy was part of the Moondogs. To try to have another persona, you're also popular as that previous persona. It was fortunate for me because Randy is a good friend of mine, but Barry is a lot more professional, and a much closer friend."

Barry Darsow: "When I got the call to come up there, Vince called me and told me I have the chance to be partners with Bill Eadie, I just said yes right away. I just jumped at the chance."

If Demolition are a rip off of the Road Warriors:

Eadie: "We knew what we could do, we felt we were successful. I thought we did it better. This is an ego driven business, so if you don't have confidence in yourself, you need to get out of the business. There's gonna be fans that say that we are rip offs, but there's gonna be Demolition fans that say they (Road Warriors) were the rip offs. I can't be worried about that. My main concern and his (Darsow) main concern is we went to work each day, and we did the best we could."
