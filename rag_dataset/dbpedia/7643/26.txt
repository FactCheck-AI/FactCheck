Yesterday, a day after officials in Arnold Schwarzenegger's Austrian birthplace of Graz removed his name from a soccer stadium to comply with the California governor's wishes, they deleted references to him on the city's Web sites.

Schwarzenegger earlier this month wrote to Graz officials asking for his name to be removed from the stadium and ordering the city to stop using it for promotional purposes. The governor was reacting to fierce criticism from opponents in his hometown who denounced him for refusing to block the Dec. 13 execution in California of Stanley Tookie Williams. Schwarzenegger also said he was returning an ornate ring of honour that Graz officials gave him in 1999.

Capital punishment is illegal in Schwarzenegger's native Austria, where many people consider it barbaric. AP
