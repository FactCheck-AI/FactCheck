If you’re a fan of shark attack films, I’ve got a trailer here for you to watch for a new thriller titled The Reef: Stalked, which is a sequel to the 2010 film The Reef. The director of the first movie, Andrew Traucki, returns to write and direct the sequel.

I don’t recall ever seeing the first film, but it’s described as being “one of the best shark attack horror movies ever made, a simple tale of friends stranded in shark-infested waters that’s made all the more terrifying due to Traucki’s insistence on using real sharks rather than animatronic or computer-generated ones.”

So, he threw his actors into real shark-infested waters and yelled “Action!” I guess that’s one way to do it.

In the sequel, “Nic, in an effort to heal after witnessing her sister’s horrific murder, travels to a tropical resort with her friends for a kayaking and diving adventure. Only hours into their expedition, the women are stalked and then attacked by a great white shark. To survive they will need to band together and Nic will have to overcome her post-traumatic stress, face her fears and slay the monster.”

Mark Ward, Chief Acquisitions Officer of RLJE Films shared in a statement: “Audiences have an insatiable appetite for shark films, which we know first-hand from our incredible experience releasing The Reef years ago. We are thrilled to be working with the team again to bring this new terrifying adventure to audiences.”

The Reef: Stalked stars Teressa Liane (The Vampire Diaries), Ann Truong (Cowboy Bebop), Saskia Archer (Boshack), Kate Lister (Clickbait) and Tim Ross (Wonderland).

RLJE Films will debut The Reef: Stalked in select US theaters and on VOD starting July 29th, 2022. Watch the trailer and let us know what you think!
