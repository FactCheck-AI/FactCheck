650 AM WSM is one of the most important radio stations in my life. I love the fact that you can tune in any time, day or night, and hear the amazing history that’s gone on with our music and what’s coming before us. The one place in the world that you can hear the current records of today and also the great records from fifty, sixty, seventy years ago.

I just really love what you guys are doing with Nashville music. I think you are the definitive country music station in America!

I love listening online. These guys really know how to program a real Country radio station. Listen online for yourself, if you want to try a radio station that knows what they’re doing.
