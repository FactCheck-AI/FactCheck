City of Leicester

The historic city of Leicester, in the English East Midlands, lies on the river Soar. The city has a population of about 280,000, although there are over 330,000 people living in the greater Leicester urban area. It was a county borough until 1974, when it became a district of the administrative county of Leicestershire. In 1996, the city of Leicester became a unitary authority.

The Leicester Jewish Community

There had been a medieval Jewish community in Leicester, which was expelled about 1280 by Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester. His followers massacred Jews from Winchester to Lincoln. The city contains the remains of a Roman wall dating from the 2nd century CE, known as Jewry Wall, but it is uncertain whether this has any connection with the medieval Jewish community.

The first resident in modern times that could be identified as a Jew was in 1849. The first organised modern Jewish community dates from about 20 years later.
