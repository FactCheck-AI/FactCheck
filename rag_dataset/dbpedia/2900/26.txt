Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance

The Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) is an executive agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community and is responsible for matters related to civil protection and disaster assistance. The BBK takes into account all areas of civil disaster preparedness and integrates them into an effective mechanism in order to protect the population and its livelihood. BBK advises and supports other state-level and national authorities in their daily work. For example, it developed methods for risk analysis in civil protection, which can be applied for risk analyses on all administrative levels. Within the scope of its responsibilities in warning the population in case of hazards, BBK e.g. operates the warning app NINA that transmits hazard alerts to the public. The Academy for Crisis Management, Emergency Planning and Civil Protection as the central educational institution of the federal state regarding risk and crisis management, and regarding civil protection is organized by the BBK. Furthermore, the National Focal Point for the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction is based at the BBK.

Federal Office for Agriculture and Food

The Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (German: Bundesanstalt für Landwirtschaft und Ernährung (BLE) has a wide range of tasks in the fields of agriculture, food, rural areas, forestry, fisheries and consumer protection. As a modern service center, it supports its partners in the portfolio of the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), in the federal states and in industry. As a project management office within the BMEL, the BLE promotes and supervises numerous national and international projects along the entire agricultural value chain. At the international level, the BLE advises the BMEL on general issues of international cooperation and world nutrition and performs tasks in the field of EU research coordination.

As the market regulation body in the area of EU agricultural market and foreign trade regulations, it implements measures to stabilize agricultural markets, among other things.

At the federal level, the BLE also performs key food security and precautionary tasks outside times of crisis. These include regular recording of the supply situation, analysis and planning tasks, and organizational and technical management of national food stocks. In the event of a crisis, the BLE is given extended powers to secure the nationwide supply of food and feed.
