SANDY MARTINEZ, Producer

Sandy has managed actors for more than 20 years and been working as a producer for

17. As a die-hard fan of independent film and its artisans, she is interested in helping to

develop exportable projects with universal appeal.

She began producing in 2003 on the pilot Midnight Shift, where she was responsible for

production, casting and was Second AD. As Associate Producer of the cult genre feature

Eternal, she produced the evocative teaser which launched the filmâ€™s successful

release.

Sandy came on board on Jim Donovan's feature 3 Saisons as Co-Producer and rose to

the challenge of making it on a very low budget. The film went on to receive a myriad of

awards, nominations and critical acclaim. Shortly thereafter, director Charles-Olivier

Michaud enlisted her to produce his first feature Snow And Ashes. The stakes were

high as director wanted to recreate war-torn Chechnya with snowy landscapes and have

a cast of Russian speaking characters, all on a challenging shooting budget. The film

received many accolades and awards in Canada and abroad, prominently the Grand

Jury Award at the Slamdance Film Festival 2010.

Sandy has a keen understanding of all aspects of the entertainment industry. With her

recent production experiences under her belt, Sandy continues to manage artists around

the world and to evolve in the industry as producer. With the original series The Last

Tribe, Sandy is enthusiastic to bring to life a story that is so unique, epic and primal.
