Vicky Kalogera, the Daniel I. Linzer Distinguished Professor of Physics and Astronomy and director of the Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has been awarded the 2018 Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics from the American Institute of Physics and the American Astronomical Society. The prize comes with a cash award of $10,000.

The citation accompanying the award praised Dr. Kalogera’s “fundamental contributions to advancing our understanding of the evolution and fate of compact objects in binary systems, with particular regard to their electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals.”

“It’s a great honor to receive the Heineman Prize,” Professor Kalogera said. “I’m grateful to my early mentors and to have had the opportunity to work with talented collaborators, students and postdocs as we pursued key questions that connected to the beginnings of a new field in astrophysics.”

Dr. Kalogera is a graduate of the University of Thessaloniki in Greece. She holds a Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Illinois. Professor Kalogera joined the faculty at Northwestern University in 2001.
