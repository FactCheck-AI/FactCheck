Columbia Pictures Original One-Sheet Poster Folded Very Fine Condition

Original Columbia Pictures One Sheet Poster (27x41) for the Lewis Gilbert dramatic comedy, EDUCATING RITA (1983) starring Michael Caine, Julie Walters, Michael Williams, and Maureen Lipman. Based on a London stage play, this excellent British production is about a 27-year-old middle-class London hairdresser/housewife (Walters) who enrolls in a literature course. An older professor (Caine) who suffers from alcoholism and low self-esteem is assigned to be her tutor. Caine teaches her to value her own insights while still being able to ace the exams. With much wit and good humor, the message of the film is empowering. Caine and Walters are truly excellent in their performances; indeed, they both received nominations for Best Actor and Actress. Also, screenwriter Willy Russell was nominated for Best Screenplay. This original one sheet poster is folded and in very fine condition. MovieArt Austin guarantees this folded one-sheet poster to be the authentic U.S. one-sheet for this film. MovieArt Austin will sell NO reproductions.
