Fans of golden age comic book pulp adventure are in for a treat because a Rocketeer board game has been announced.

An official press release by Funko Games goes into further detail. The full title is The Rocketeer: Fate of the Future, and is described as a two-player immersive board game. Based on the 1991 live-action Disney film, it has two players square off in a cat-and-mouse game where they try to keep top-secret rocket plans hidden from each other. One group plays as the titular Rocketeer and his allies while the other plays as the villainous Neville Sinclair and his gang of cronies.

This Rocketeer board game isn't just a reskinned product either. The game has been developed by Prospero Hall, the Seattle-based developer behind acclaimed titles like Disney's Villainous and the air-travel board game Pan Am. Given the developer's history of interesting competitive interplay with Villainous, it is safe to believe the psychological back and forth for Rocketeer: Fate of the Future is in good hands.

Additional details about the Rocketeer board game are listed on Funko Game's store page. A single game should take about forty-five minutes and is intended for players of ages 12 and up. As for where you can buy it, you have two options. If you are attending GenCon this year you can purchase the game on the show floor during the convention between September 16-19. However much scrutiny has happened over Gencon this year to the point that multiple major board game publishers will not be in attendance. Not helping this has been the low percentage of vaccinated citizens in the state of Indiana as well as the current rules regarding masks and vaccination for attendants.

If you wish to wait, the Rocketeer board game will be available in retail stores this Fall. It will cost you $24.99.
