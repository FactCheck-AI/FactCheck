Director Francis Ford Coppola has revealed that he regrets filming sequels to The Godfather.

Coppola admitted to TMZ this week that continuing the Corleone family's saga for two further films was a mistake.

"There should have only been one. You know, it was a drama," Coppola told a press photographer.

The original Godfather was a commercial and critical smash upon release in 1972, earning three Academy Awards, a BAFTA and five Golden Globes.

The Godfather Part II impressed audiences two years later and took in $193m at the box office.

The third Godfather movie received less praise from critics, but did receive seven Academy Award nominations in 1991.

Coppola insisted that despite the continued interest in the Godfather series, he wouldn't consider returning to the Corleone crime family for a fourth feature film.

His next project, the thriller Twixt, is expected to be released in 2012.
