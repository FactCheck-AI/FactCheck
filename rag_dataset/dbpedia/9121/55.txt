Mali would have run out of salt, which they imported in exchange for gold. Lack of salt could result in serious health issues and even death.

Ibn Battuta:

The saltworks at the oasis of Taghaza

"After twenty-five days [from Sijilmasa] we reached Taghaza, an unattractive village, with the curious feature that its houses and mosques are built of blocks of salt, roofed with camel skins. There are no trees there, nothing but sand. In the sand is a salt mine; they dig for the salt, and find it in thick slabs, lying one on top of the other, as though they had been tool-squared and laid under the surface of the earth. A camel will carry two of these slabs.

No one lives at Taghaza except the slaves of the Massufa tribe [a Berber tribe], who dig for the salt; they subsist on dates imported from Dar'a and Sijilmasa, camels' flesh, and millet imported from the Negrolands. The negroes come up from their country and take away the salt from there. At Iwalatan a load of salt brings eight to ten mithqals; in the town of Malli [Mali] it sells for twenty to thirty, and sometimes as much as forty. The negroes use salt as a medium of exchange, just as gold and silver is used [elsewhere]; they cut it up into pieces and buy and sell with it. The business done at Taghaza, for all its meanness, amounts to an enormous figure in terms of hundredweights of gold-dust."

Can't they just trade with coastal groups like the Sapes for Salt? They'll just have to change their export good to like Cattle products and manufactured goods like ceramics and beads.

They already traded with peoples farther south to them, though our understanding of these networks is minimal; both were important for the Mali economy and the Empire would have had some difficulty without them.

To the best of my knowledge, furthest south they traded were like with states in the middle of the the Guinea Savannah like Bonomanso and Bonomanso didn't trade with coastal peoples so they can't get Sea Salt from that route.

But What was so important about the trade with North Africa that they couldn't just substitute with the South?.

Well first, I highly doubt states in Ghana didn't trade with people in the Volta basin or other coastal areas; we need to consider the paucity of archaeological evidence but the earliest historical documents record trade that went to inland polities for nearly all coastal states. But if coastal people were trading inland, then a lot of their produce likely would have been consumed by those inland. Perhaps they were using coastal peoples for salt.

You know, I have to agree on the first point.

Another Question, what influence did Mande traders from around Mali's height and after have on trade routes further south.

I think those their produce if they were valuable to people in the Sahel would have reached them through intermediaries, providing the stimulus for the coastal people to produce even more. That that never happened implies there was never such a demand.

Because I think coastal peoples like the Sapes had the organization to meet Sahelian demands for Salt if there was ever such demand.

Another Question, what influence did Mande traders from around Mali's height and after have on trade routes further south.

Well first, one should probably look to de-ethnitize who was trading where. Mali's trade networks were fueled by a mixture of different peoples speaking a whole host of languages and belonging to many of the ethnic groups indigenous to Mali, and some foreign ones. As for influence, as far as I know it's all unclear. We are aware Mali conquered some territories farther south from time to time in order to gain better access to resources; presumably Mali would have had decent influence on those territories but some more knowledgeable than I would be more suited to comment further on that.

That that never happened implies there was never such a demand.

Sure but does that really mean Mali wasn't interacting with the south? As you yourself acknowledged, no. We have evidence of goods like glass beads being widespread in West Africa, suggesting wide-spread trade networks.

Okay, let me get back to the Salt thing. From what I have read the most important thing about the trade with North Africa and the Sahara was getting Salt. Why can't they just trade with coastal peoples for that instead?.

I swear we already had this discussion. My answer is: why? Salt mines were literally in the Sahara. Why trade with Coastal peoples who have to go through far more prominent intermediaries? You ask "why can't they do" X without considering why they didn't.

What of coastal people in Senegal to Sierre Leone, those don't have as much necessary intermediaries than like say Kru. It can go from Sapes to Niominka or straight from the Niominka themselves and we're already in the Mali Empire.

... for what? Assuming that they didn't (which is implicit in your statements but which you've never provided evidence for), why would they if their trade routes were working out for them?
