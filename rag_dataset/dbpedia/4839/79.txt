Gilbert had to wait for a sight-saving operation in the bad eye after an infection caused by a tiny piece of dirt.

Although he made a short-lived first-team return with one eye stitched up as a precaution, the operation led to a further 14 months on the sidelines with his career hanging in the balance.

Gilbert admitted Saturday's goal was a defining moment in his recovery. He said: ''It was a big moment for me in only my second home game since returning. It was definitely the best I've ever scored.

''I just want to put the eye thing behind me now and look to the future, but I'm glad to be back and proving myself again at this level.''
