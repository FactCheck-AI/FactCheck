The Neighbourhood is one of those bands that intentionally likes to fly under the radar. The band doesn’t even have a Wikipedia page! Blending many different types of genres together, this band has the talent to be a breakout, mainstream band. But do they want it that way? What are your thoughts on “Sweater Song”, the debut EP, and the potential of this very young band? Sound off in the comments section below!

“And if I may just take your breath away.

I don’t mind if there’s not much to say,

Sometimes the silence guides our minds to move to a place so far away.

The goosebumps start to raise,

The minute that my left hand meets your waist.

And then I watch your face,

Put my finger on your tongue ’cause you love the taste, yeah.

These hearts adore,

Every one the other beats hard is for.

Inside this place it’s warm,

Outside it starts to pour”
