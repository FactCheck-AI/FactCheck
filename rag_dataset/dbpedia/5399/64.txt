I received a note from Ben from the Official Beyond The Farthest Star site.

If you go to the site, and see a giant button that says "Demand It" - click on it and register. The more names they collect, the demand it button helps show their distributors that there are people who really want to see the film come to their area and that includes outside the US.

You can only register once. It takes you info and area and you can only do that once. So, they just need lots of people registering but once each.
