One of Thailandâ€™s least visited national parks, Pha Taem deserves much more exposure. Not only does it boast some awesome scenery -- the views over the Mekong River to Laos from the top of the cliff that dominates the park are incredible -- it also has prehistoric rock painting dating back to at least 1000BC. Other highlights include waterfalls and unique rock formations.
