Howard County Police are investigating the death of a 3-year-old boy who was shot inside a home on Harpers Farm Road in Columbia on July 1. Police believe the shooting was accidental.

Detectives have determined a handgun was unsecured inside the residence. Police are still working to determine if the gunshot was self-inflicted or fired by another member of the residence. The child's 5-year-old brother and parents were home at the time. They do not believe anyone else was involved and do not see any indications of foul play.

While no charges have been filed at this time, the investigation is ongoing. Detectives are consulting with the Howard County State’s Attorney’s office. Additional information will be released as it becomes available.
