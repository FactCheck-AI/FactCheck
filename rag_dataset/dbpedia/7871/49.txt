1. Queens of the Stone Age Members: Founder, Josh Homme has been the only constant member as the others change often. Josh Homme is 45 and founded the band in 1996 during the desert-rock prime. He has been their lead singer/guitarist frontman for the last 20 years. They’re a very large part of the Desert-Rock genre, however are known to write/play music of variable genre often with a harder metal sound. They have a very grungy style, though sometimes dip into a more electronic sound with a focus on eerie tone. They’ve been signed to seven different record labels but are currently independent. They began to get produced when Josh Homme’s former band, Kyuss, split up and developed into the less chaotic rock band Qotsa. Josh Homme had been part of several bands before forming Qotsa and worked with famous rock/metal artists such as Dave Grohl. He became more famous when Nirvana brought grunge/rock to the mass audiences. Their target audience is very ambiguous as it has changed throughout the bands 22 year existence, primarily being local adolescents in the Californian desert rock scene, yet has now developed into something less categorical as instead of aiming for commercial success the band focus on artistic endeavour. They’ve received several awards from popular rock/metal magazines such as MTV, Kerrang and NME.
