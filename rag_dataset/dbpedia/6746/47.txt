Pope Alexander VI, also known as Rodrigo Borgia, was the Pope between 1492 until his death in 1503. He was infamously of the House of Borgia, being the one to make it prominent in the Papal States and was the father of Cesare Borgia and Lucrezia Borgia. His reign as pontificate was infamously known for nepotism and accused by rivals for incest, bribery, theft, and bribery. In his reign, his son, Cesare Borgia set off to conquer Central Italy and carve out a state for the Borgias...

And then Pope Alexander VI died. He died in 1503 of Illness (Possibly Malaria), although some accounts said of accidental poisoning. He died at the age of 72, and after brief Borgia friendly Pope who died soon as well, the title of Pope fell to the rival Julius II, which caused the downfall of the Borgias. Cesare would lose his lands, be sent to jail and then escaped to Navarre where he died in an ambush.

What if, Pope Alexander VI lived for another decade, instead dying at the age of 72, he lives another 10 years and lives till 82?

With Alexander VI longer rule, what could possibly happen with the Italian Wars between the HRE, Spain and France? What would Cesare Borgia do, as he was planning on a conquest of Tuscany? How would him surviving effect the future of the Borgia Family?

I bit doubt that Borgia jr. is going to succeed on his goals. There is just too much of opposition. Papacy would be even futher corrupted. There might be even more radical and possibility earlier reformation movement.

Well, here Cesare would have the time for consolidating his power and Alexander’s reputation would be better as Julius II (who hated him) would not be able to destroy it…

Alexander’s predecessors were NOT less corrupted than him (and Julius II, Leo X and Paul III were NOT better under many aspects, same for Clement VII).
