A US district court judge in Alaska appointed by President Donald Trump is suddenly planning to leave the federal bench.

Joshua Kindred, who sits on the US District Court for the District of Alaska, on Wednesday submitted plans to resign as of July 8, according to the federal judiciaryâs vacancies page. He was confirmed 54-41 in February 2020.

A copy of his two-sentence resignation letter posted by the court Friday didnât provide a reason for his forthcoming departure. The districtâs clerk said Kindredâs cases will be reassigned by later Friday, but her statement was silent on the reason heâs leaving.

Only one other Trump appointee, Michael Juneau, has so far left active judicial service, according to the Federal Judicial Center database. Juneau, who sat on the Western District of Louisiana, took senior status due to a disability in 2022 and died a year later. Several appointees of President Barack Obama have left judgeships since Joe Biden took office for more lucrative work in the private sector, although such a sudden departure like Kindredâs is unusual.

Kindred was born in 1977 in North Carolina and moved to Alaska when his father, who served in the Air Force, was transferred there, according to a 2021 profile in the Federal Lawyer. He worked full time at a hardware store after high school, before graduating from the University of Alaska, Anchorage and then Willamette University College of Law.

He clerked for the Oregon Supreme Court and worked as an assistant district attorney in Anchorage as well as for the Alaska Oil and Gas Association and the Interior Departmentâs Office of the Regional Solicitor before his nomination to the federal bench in 2019.

âIt was humbling, but I realized I was one of the youngest people in the applicant pool, and I made peace with it,â Kindred told the Federal Lawyer about the judicial selection process.
