Washington, D.C. – Senator Ron Wyden welcomed today’s announcement by The White House that Washington County Circuit Judge Marco Hernandez and Portland attorney Michael Simon have been nominated for two vacant federal district court judgeships in Oregon.

“Judge Hernandez and Michael Simon are distinguished members of Oregon’s legal community,” Wyden said. “These are well-deserved and well-earned appointments that I believe deserve quick confirmation by the Senate.”

In April 2009, Wyden and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon appointed a 13-member statewide committee to find replacements for two federal judges who are taking senior status, Judge Ancer Haggerty and Judge Garr M. King, both of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Following the committee’s work, Wyden forwarded six names to The White House for consideration, including Hernandez and Simon.
