Charles Redman is a Virginia M. Ullmann Professor of Natural History and the Environment in the School of Human Evolution and Social Change in College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the Founding Director of the School of Sustainability. He has been committed to interdisciplinary research since as an archaeology graduate student he worked closely in the field with botanists, zoologists, geologists, art historians, and ethnographers. Professor Redman taught at New York University and at SUNY-Binghamton before coming to Arizona State University in 1983. Since then, he served nine years as chair of the Department of Anthropology, seven years as director of the Center for Environmental Studies and, in 2004, was chosen to be the Julie Ann Wrigley Director of the newly formed Global Institute of Sustainability. From 2007-2010, Professor Redman was the founding director of ASUâ€™s School of Sustainability. His interests include human impacts on the environment, sustainable landscapes, rapidly urbanizing regions, urban ecology, environmental education, and public outreach. He is the author or co-author of 14 books including "Explanation in Archaeology," "The Rise of Civilization," "People of the Tonto Rim," "Human Impact on Ancient Environments" and, most recently, co-edited four books: "The Archaeology of Global Change," "Applied Remote Sensing for Urban Planning," "Governance and Sustainability," "Agrarian Landscapes in Transition," and "Politics and Power: Archaeological Perspectives on the Landscapes of Early States." Professor Redman is currently working on NSF-sponsored Urban Reslience to Extreme Events Sustainbility Research Network (URExSRN), a project to encourage the building of more resilient infrastructure in cities of the future.
