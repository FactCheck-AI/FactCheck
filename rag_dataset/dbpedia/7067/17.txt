Prof. Dr. Cora Uhlemann was appointed as a professor for Cosmology at Bielefeld University in March 2024. She completed her doctorate in cosmology at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München 2015, and then worked as a postdoc at the Delta Institute for Theoretical Physics in Utrecht (Netherlands) and later at the Stephen Hawking Centre for Theoretical Cosmology in combination with an Early Career Research Fellowship at Fitzwilliam College in Cambridge (UK). Most recently, she was a reader (associate professor) at Newcastle University (UK). Moreover, Cora Uhlemann is co-leading the Euclid Consortium and the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration, and promotes equity for female STEM researchers, e.g. through her platform for women in physics on X (formerly known as Twitter). In an interview with Lisa Janowski she talks about her start in Bielefeld and about her upcoming research projects.

In the YWTS “Meet & Greet”, Cora Uhlemann talked about how she developed her research agenda, how she addresses the fact that working as a researcher includes moving a lot within Germany and abroad, and she openly shared details about her application process to the European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant.

For the third time in a row, YWTS participated in Girls’Day, a Germany-wide initiative aimed at promoting STEM professions to girls. Twenty-six math-enthusiastic girls from high schools around Bielefeld were invited to get an impression of the daily life of a Mathematician or Economist. They started with a scavenger hunt through the library where they were challenged to find books in different categories like books by a female author or books written before 1900. Next, Professor Claudia Alfes answered their questions about what it is like to be a Mathematics professor and invited them to attend the start of her lecture on linear algebra. For the most part of the day, the girls were guided through a research question in a small group, each supervised by a female doctoral student. They discovered the mathematical phenomena of the card games Set and Dobble, calculated an ecological footprint, were introduced to best-reply strategies and proofs by induction in the game theory problem „Nim“ and discussed strategic as well as behavioral aspects of the Repeated Prisoners’ Dilemma. After lunch at mensa, each group presented their research questions and results to the others, in the spirit of attending a conference. The day ended with cake, lemonade, and playing with the games the other girls had worked on and presented.

Every semester, YWTS offers a soft skill training. In winter term 23/24, we offered a 1-day voice training to students, doctoral candidates, and PostDocs. In the morning, we learned about functions of the voice, goals of voice work, and vocal hygiene and did physical exercises to get a feeling for the position of the larynx, increase the resonance of our voice, and to learn supportive breathing techniques. In the afternoon, we continued with exercises for a good speaking posture, and how to find your perfect pitch where your voice is most clear and most effortless at the same time. The workshop closed with tips for emergencies like when your voice is strained or when you are nervous about giving a talk.

The training was hosted by the very friendly and enthusiastic Janin Schröder-Hoppe and Sabrina Dehne from Logopädie Lemgo. Thanks to their many years of collaboration with the PEP network, they know how to provide targeted support for female scientists and students.

Mathematics professor Dr. Claudia Alfes-Neumann initiated the YWTS networks series “Coffee for female mathematicians”. She was interviewed for Uni Bielefeld’s website about her research and her vita. With respect to being a women in academia she shared:

‘Mathematics is still a male-dominated field. In my own studies, I was in my fourth year before a female lecturer taught me for the first time,’ says Alfes-Neumann. She thinks it’s important to better connect women in science: ‘That will provide more opportunities to also talk about personal experiences—for example, what it’s like to become a mother as a postdoc.’

During SFB 1283’s Conference on “SPDEs, Optimal Control and Mean Field Games’’, YWTS coordinated a workshop on ‘”Taming Uncertainty: How to Address Self-Doubt as a Female Scientist’’. In small groups, invited speakers and participants of the conference as well as YWTS member shared how they dealt with moments of self-doubt and how they made tough decision. A variety of coping strategies was discussed; with the most popular ones being asking for help and discussing the situation with friends or family. The workshop closed with everyone naming one positive and distinguishing quality about themselves. It was nice to see the diversity in the answers, e.g., being creative, outgoing, brave, self-organized, confident in talking in front of others, having received great feedback in the past, relying on a good network, and being able to do what you enjoy: working in academia.

For Girls’ Day 2023, 14 math-enthusiastic high school girls from Bielefeld and the surrounding area visited Bielefeld University to gain an insight into theoretical sciences. At the side of (post)doctoral students, they immersed into the life of a young scientist for one day. First thing in the morning, girls and researchers got to know each other by sharing why they are passionate about maths. Next, the girls were kindly invited to ask questions to Jr.-Prof. Lukas Kühne and attend the beginning of his lecture on Linear Algebra I. The girls then spent most of the day in groups of 3, supervised by 1 or 2 YWTS members, to puzzle over a variety of mathematical problems in a playful way. They conducted experiments on probability by throwing dice, investigated the Birthday Paradoxon, and played with the card game Set and the tower of Hanoi to question and understand mathematical patterns in their everyday lives. Finally, each group presented their results to the others to simulate attending a conference. In that spirit, the day ended with some networking while eating cake and playing the games that had been explored during the day.
