Jacob KOONTZ & wife Catherine, Anthony STARLIPPER & wife Catherine, & Eve MILLER vs Jacob KEEFER (KEAVER)

Charity, then w/o Jacob KEAVER died 1811, intestate without issue Previously, she had been the w/o Jacob FULWYDER and his will left her a life estate; after her death, the property was to be divided with one half to Henry FULLWYDER's children and the other half to his wife's friends; ten pounds went to Evangelist & Calvinist Church in Middle Town; his will written 10 Aug 1792 and probated 21 Sep 1792.

There was a great variety of interpretation of the term "wife's friends". Her second husband tried to claim the property and injunctions were issued and and countered. Court action finally resolved the issue by dividing the property equally among the heirs of both Jacob FULWYDER and Charity KEAVER.

John KOONTZ vs SHUH [SHUE] Family

Frederick County Chancery - 4 Sep 1815 Chancery 92, pg 363 MSA S 512-3025 1/3613/91 MdHR 17, 898-2941 1/2

John KARHN d/ intestate leaving widow - Magdalena & 8 children - Jacob; Catherine YOUNG; Elizabeth; Barbary w/o John FRY; Frederick, dec; Magdalene (Margaret), dec - w/o Solomon SHUE, their children - Jacob & Solomon SHUE; Susanna; Ann.

His daughter Magdalena died before her father and her husband Solomon SHUE was guardian for their children. The sale of the estate brought $1,265.11 ($158.03 each). Administrators of his account were Jacob CARN & Solomon SHUE with final distribution dtd 10 April 1806 giving the widow $208.01 and each living child $52.00.

Solomon SHUE d/ intestate (before Sep 1815) leaving widow - Elizabeth (b/ 29 Sep 1777 per John KOONTZ) Children - (all minors): Jacob; Solomon; Rebecca; Mary Ann; Christiana; John Alexander. On 3 Nov 1815, Elizabeth SHUE was appointed guardian of her children; later, John FRY was appointed as guardian for Jacob SHUE and Daniel HOLTZAPPLE for Solomon SHUE with John H. SIMMONS as administrator.

Solomon owned a Flaxseed oil mill with a stone mill house and 28 acres in the neighborhood of Mr. Brown's factory. He was, however, indebted to John KOONTZ for the mortgage and a date of nonpayment is listed as 26 Sep 1811 (which may indicate a closer time to his death??). John KOONTZ had also signed as security for the minor's bond of Solomon's children. Elizabeth SHUE allowed the sale of her dower with the real estate to settle the estate (her dower of 1/7 was only $85). The estate was sold to John H. SIMMONS for $1,500 on 26 Dec 1815 but the debts still exceeded the proceeds.

Note - There is strong indication Elizabeth may be the sister of John KOONTZ although not stated in the records.

(In Maryland German Church Records, Vol. 6, pg. 21, Soloman Schuck & Elizabeth Kuntz were married 1, Oct., 1805 [ at the Evangelical Reformed Church, Frederick Maryland ].

W&M-1613. John Alfred Koons (1826-1890) and wife Georgina Celstia (Miller) (1835-1888) are buried in Haugh's Church north of Woodsboro. Ancestor Heinrich Kuhns/Kuntz probably was a Palatine German who embarked for America from the Netherlands. It may have been his son Henry (over 45 years in 1800 census) who had 6 sons, including John Coones in Buckeystown District in 1800; also Abraham, Henry, and George of age 26-45 years in Taneytwon District in the 1800 census. George Koons (1753-1817) who married Susannah Stroyer (1760-1848) is buried at Taneytown Reformed Church. Their son Peter (1795-1876) and wife Mary Ann (Ott) (1803-1866) are busied at Haugh's Church. They were parents of John Alfred Koons.

Descendent Carroll H. Hendrickson Jr. pointed out that the will of Henry Koons (died 1821) gives his children as Abraham; Henry Jr.; Jacob; deceased John, George, and William; Eve; Catherine; deceased Ann and Mary. Henry Sr., his sons George and Jacob, also Jacob Jr. were blacksmiths. Paul and Anna (Koons) Haugh had son William (1774-1845) who married Catherine Kemp (1777-1824). Their son David (1804-1878) and wife Abalonia (1803-1885) had daughter Mary Catherine Haugh (1833-1909) who married Daniel R. Hendrickson (1826-1898) (Mt. Olivet), a great grandfather of Carroll H. H. Jr.

In Adams Co., there have been numerous Kuhn familities and fewer Kuhns and Kuntz (WB). A Georg Kuntz, linen weaver, emigarted in 1732 from Hatten in northern Alsace. He married in 1720 Catherine Jaeger (b. 1690) (B3). Cf Weiser MHM 2,11 (1979) and W&M1517.
