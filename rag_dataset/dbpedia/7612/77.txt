Steve Punt's quiz show where a team of three students take on a team of three of their professors

Recorded on location at a different university each week, The 3rd Degree pits three undergraduates against three of their professors in a genuinely original and fresh take on an academic quiz.

The rounds vary between specialist subjects and general knowledge, quickfire bell-and-buzzer rounds and the 'Highbrow and Lowbrow' round - which is cunningly devised to test not only the students' knowledge of current affairs, history, languages and science, but also their professors' awareness of television, sport and, quite possibly, Ed Sheeran... In addition, there are head-to-head rounds where the students take on the professors in their own subjects, offering plenty of scope for embarrassment on both sides.

In Series 13, the universities are Exeter, Strathclyde, Somerville College Oxford, Keele, King's College London and Portsmouth.
