Arthur Brittain Netherby was a banker and financial agent. He lived at 1884 Haro Street in 1919.

Family Background

Arthur Brittain Netherby was born on July 12, 1881, in Wellington County, Ontario. His parents were Stephen Brittain Netherby (1835-1921) and Sarah Catherine Weeks (1844-1928). Stephen Netherby was a teacher and a school principal.

Stephen Netherby died at Barnet, British Columbia in 1921.

Sarah Netherby died at Bridge River, British Columbia in 1928.

Early Life

Arthur went to school in Victoria, British Columbia.

He later became an employee of the Royal Bank of Canada.

Marriage to Flora MacDonald

On June 10, 1908, in Nelson, British Columbia, Arthur married Flora MacDonald. She was born on October 30, 1885, in Brandon, Manitoba. Her parents were William Alexander Macdonald (1860-1946) and Mary Elizabeth Gamble (1864-1921). William Macdonald was a lawyer and judge who lived at 1875 Robson Street in 1909, at 1816 Haro Street from 1910 to 1918, and at 1884 Haro Street from 1920 to 1941.

Family Life in British Columbia and Saskatchewan

Until 1916, Arthur and Flora were living at 623 Carbonate Street in Nelson. Arthur was the manager of the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada.

In June 1916, Arthur became the manager of the Royal Bank in Regina, Saskatchewan.

To Vancouver

In November 1918, Arthur and his family moved from Regina to Vancouver.

From 1919 to about 1923, the Netherby family was in Vancouver.

In 1919, Arthur was the manager of the Reliable Investment Company, and he was living at 1884 Haro Street.

To United States

According to the 1930 United States census, Arthur and Flora immigrated to the United States in 1923.

It appears that Arthur died in Tulsa, Oklahoma in February 1933.
