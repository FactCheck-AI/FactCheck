The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Publication 140-3 is a US and Canadian government standard that specifies the security requirements for cryptographic modules that protect sensitive information. If you require use of FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules when accessing AWS US East/West, AWS GovCloud (US), or AWS Canada (Central/West) through use of the command line interface (CLI) or programmatically by using the APIs, the following sections provide the list of available FIPS endpoints by AWS Region. All of the FIPS endpoints on this page utilize cryptography from the AWS LibCrypto (AWS-LC) FIPS Module, Certificate #4631. More information on AWS-LC FIPS can be found in this AWS Security blog post.

AWS Site-to-Site VPN endpoints in AWS GovCloud (US) operate using FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. In non-GovCloud Regions, we support the FIPS-compliant algorithm set for IKEv2/IPsec as long as the customer gateway negotiates only FIPS-compatible ciphers. AWS works with customers to provide the information they need to manage compliance when using the AWS US East/West, AWS GovCloud (US), or AWS Canada (Central/West) Regions. For more information about the standard, see Cryptographic Module Validation Program on the NIST Computer Security Resource Center website.
