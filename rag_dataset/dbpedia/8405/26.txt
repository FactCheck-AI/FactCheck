As far as the education level of foreigners is concerned, it is actually higher than is often believed. While it is true that the least educated individuals (with incomplete primary studies or no studies) make up a larger portion of the foreign population than among Spaniards (7.3% of those over 16 years of age vs. 5.1%) and those with higher education are proportionally fewer (23.7% vs. 34.1%), foreigners with secondary education make up the group that has grown the most in recent years: since Q3 2015 their numbers have increased by 751,000 (+35.9% vs. 3.9% for Spaniards) to represent 58.1% of the total, exceeding the figure of 2015 (56.8%) as well as that corresponding to Spanish citizens (49.7%).

As for the jobs performed by foreigners, in recent years we have seen a widespread increase in the relative weight of these workers across the board, although their presence is greater in elementary occupations and jobs with lower skills requirements. For example, in terms of Social Security affiliates, more than 25% of those employed in the hotel and restaurant industry and 18% in construction are foreigners, whereas in 2015 these percentages stood at 19.5% and 10.6%, respectively; in transport and storage there has also been a significant increase, going from 7.4% to 13.6%. At the other end of the scale, the role of foreigners is less relevant in the industrial branches of the economy, including extractive industries (5.9% vs. 5.3%) and manufacturing (8.4% vs. 5.6%).
