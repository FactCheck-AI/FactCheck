Memories of Kalash Valley: It was not a long time ago when I was floating in dreamy and magical clouds and cool breeze of northern areas of Pakistan. I have visited so many areas. Some are stuck in my mind like a puzzle. The beauty of northern areas has no match, Kalash Valley is one of them. Some memories are long lasting especially the mornings and evenings spend in northern areas. It felt like chilling breeze was permeating in the bones.

âMy wish is to stay always like this, living quietly in a corner of nature.â – Claude Monet.

Life in Kalash Valley:

Kalash or kalasha people have the most unique and extraordinary culture in the world. At least 5,000 Kalash people live across three small valleys in the Hindukush Mountains. it is situated near the city of Chitral In KPK province of Pakistan.

Cultural Values:

Their cultural beauty and customs are amazing. As these people are considered as descendent from Alexander the great and living in these valleys from thousands of year.

This society is totally different from the culture of Pakistan. Their one personâs roof is the corridor of another person. It felt like we are climbing on a tree house while visiting the staircases of this culture. Wooden window frames, front stairs made of massive stones and villages surrounded by glorious green mountains. For us, this is unusual as houses were closely connected as well as their hearts. They have something that our modern cities lack.

Few lone adventurers like me travel to these valleys every year. Where very low places for accommodation are available like private houses or some shops and some rustic hotels in Bumburet. So settle in what is available there.
