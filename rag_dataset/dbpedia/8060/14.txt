Amazon Studios has acquired North American rights to Woody Allen’s next film, an untitled romantic comedy set during the 1930s.

The film, which was shot last summer in New York and Los Angeles, stars Jeannie Berlin, Steve Carell, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Corey Stoll, and Ken Stott.

Amazon will unveil the movie this summer via a traditional nationwide theatrical release, after which it will be made available exclusively to Amazon Prime members.

“Like all beginning relationships, there is much hope, mutual affection, and genuine goodwill — the lawsuits come later,” Allen said in the announcement.

Allen’s past several films were released by Sony Pictures Classics, but he and Amazon have recently become acquainted: The streaming company enlisted the octogenarian filmmaker to make a half-hour, six-episode TV series last year. The show, also yet to be titled, is set in the ’60s and will star Allen, Miley Cyrus, and Elaine May.
