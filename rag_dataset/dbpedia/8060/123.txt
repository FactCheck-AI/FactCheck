Woody Allen has moved to digital filmmaking for the first time, using a Sony CineAlta F65 camera for his 47th film.

The untitled film began shooting in August in New York and Los Angeles. The cast includes Jeannie Berlin, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Kristen Stewart, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott and Steve Carell.

Vittorio Storaro, who won Academy Awards for the cinematography for “Apocalypse Now,” “Reds” and “The Last Emperor,” took credit for persuading Allen to shoot in digital.

“I had seen that the Sony F65 was capable of recording beautiful images in 4K and 16 bit-colour depth in 1:2, which is my favorite composition,” Storaro said. “So when Woody called me this year asking me to be the cinematographer of his new film with the working title ‘WASP 2015,’ my decision was already made. I convinced him to record the film in digital, so we can begin our journey together in the digital world. It’s time now for the Sony F65!”

Allen had indicated in May at the Cannes Film Festival that he might switch to digital for his next film.
