REASON FOR LOSS:

Took off at 05:15 hours from Landing Ground 140 flying number 3 in a formation of three aircraft led by Lt. Col. A.J.M. Mossop SAAF piloting Boston AL733 and detailed to bomb the city of Barce in north east Libya. The formation made its attack at low level and on the return flight whilst flying at 100 feet was attacked by 2 Messerschmitt Bf 109Fs flown by Lt. Friedrich Körner and Lt. Karl von Lieres und Wilkau of 2/JG 27. The crews of the Bostons had not expected the fighter to attack them whilst flying at such a low level and even then they expected just the one pass. However, the Messerschmitts continued to pursue them maintaining a long low level chase and Boston Z2225 had its starboard engine destroyed in the first attack. When in the second attack the port engine was hit, Captain Verster had no alternative but to make a high speed crash landing 35 miles south west of Bir el Hakeim. Whilst the crew were climbing out of the aircraft the enemy fighter ground strafed them and set the aircraft on fire. Air Sergeant Bender had been killed during the aerial combat and his body was burnt out with the aircraft.

The remainder of the crew then set out to walk on a compass course and after walking for 40 hours without water, were picked up by a Free French Army Patrol and returned to base.

Lt. Friedrich Körner (5) and Lt. Karl von Lieres und Wilkau (6) each claimed a Boston the other one shot down being AL733 piloted by Lt. Col. A.J.M. Mossop SAAF. Lt. Körner's victory was timed at 08:55 hours whilst Lt. Lieres u Wilkau's was time at 08:56 hours. (see Kracker Luftwaffe Archive on this site)
