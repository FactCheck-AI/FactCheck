At stake in this election:

The office of President of United States

Description of government structure:

Chief of State: President George W. BUSH *

Head of Government: President George W. BUSH **

Assembly: United States has a bicameral United States Congress consisting of the Senate with 100 seats and the House of Representatives with 435 seats.

* The President is elected indirectly by the Electoral College. Each state receives a number of Electoral College votes equal to its two Senators plus the number of seats it has in the House of Representatives, which is based on its population. Washington D.C. receives three electoral votes. Electoral College members pledge their votes to a particular candidate prior to the election and are thus empowered to cast their votes if their candidate wins a plurality in their state. In essence, when individual voters cast a vote for a presidential candiate, they are actually "electing" that candidate's pledged electoral college candidates to the electoral college. A candidate must receive a majority of electoral votes (at least 270) to be elected president.

** The president is both the chief of state and head of government.

Description of electoral system:

The President is elected by an electoral college to serve a 4-year term.

In the Senate 100 members are elected by plurality vote in single-member constituencies to serve 6-year terms*. In the House of Representatives 435 members are elected by plurality vote in single-member constituencies to serve 2-year terms.

* *One-third of Senate seats are up for elections every two years.
