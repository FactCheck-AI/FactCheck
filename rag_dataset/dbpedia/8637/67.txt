Where to Watch

Loren Dean heads an ensemble cast that includes Alfre Woodard and Ted Danson, in Lawrence Kasdan's beguiling and gently satiric comedy. Dean plays an enigmatic man named Mumford who sets up shop as a psychologist in a town that's also called Mumford. He quickly becomes the most trusted and popular man in town, but he's harboring a secret. Martin Short, Hope Davis, Jason Lee.
