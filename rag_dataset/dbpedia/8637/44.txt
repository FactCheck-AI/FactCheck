Mumford on Blu-ray

From writer/director Lawrence Kasdan, the creator Body Heat, The Big Chill, Silverado, The Accidental Tourist and Grand Canyon. When a wanna-be psychologist, curiously named Mumford (Loren Dean, Space Cowboys) comes to the idyllic town of the same name, he offers his talent for listening and a disarming frankness as the town's quirkiest citizens scramble for a seat on his couch. As he lightens hearts darkened by old secrets-including those of the beautiful and troubled Sofie Crisp (Hope Davis, About Schmidt)-no one realizes he's hiding a whopper of his own, or that he's fallen head over heels for one of his patients. Filled with personality disorders, surprises, offbeat alliances and some hilarious fantasies, Mumford is just what the laugh doctor ordered. The wonderful cast includes Jason Lee (Chasing Amy), Mary McDonnell (Dances with Wolves), David Paymer (Get Shorty), Martin Short (Â¡Three Amigos!), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Wild at Heart), Alfre Woodard (Cross Creek), Jane Adams (Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind), Priscilla Barnes (TV's Three's Company), Ted Danson (TV's Cheers), Zooey Deschanel (500 Days of Summer), Elisabeth Moss (TV's The Handmaid's Tale), Robert Stack (Airplane!) and Kevin Tighe (Road House).
