Dr. Mumford (Loren Dean) is the new psychologist in a small town. His unique style of therapy draws many patients, including a billionaire (Jason Lee) and a woman with chronic fatigue syndrome (Hope Davis). But Mumford also draws the ire of the town's two established doctors (David Paymer, Jane Adams). Resentful of Mumford's success, they hire an attorney (Martin Short) to impugn his character, and together they reveal shocking secrets from Mumford's past.
