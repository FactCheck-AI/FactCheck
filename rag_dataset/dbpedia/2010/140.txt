Policy Memos are briefer and less formal than NEPC briefs. They may, for example, provide information such as a list of education experts, or offer a quick assessment of the merits of a particular policy proposal in the news, or provide a commentary on a topical subject. NEPC Policy Memos may be blind peer reviewed.

NEPC Document Use Policy: NEPC publications are provided free of cost to NEPCâ€™s readers, who may make non-commercial use of them as long as NEPC and its authors are credited as the source. For inquiries about commercial use, please contact NEPC at nepc@colorado.edu.
