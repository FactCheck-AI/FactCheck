Dr Who K-9 :

K-9 is a robotic dog who has appeared in the Dr Who programmes over the years and who servers the Doctor on his travels. The most distinctive word K9 uses is affirmative master closely followed by the phrase insufficient data.

The mechanics of K-9 included rotating ear-probes, telescopic 'eye' probe, extendable nose concealing a powerful laser weapon, flashing lights on the top and the 'eye' panel, waggling tail antennae, and ticker-tape tongue.

The head could also move up and down.

The shell was painted in gold/grey metallic. Around K9's neck was a tartan collar, from which hung a silver disk
