Doctor Who’s Steven Moffat wanted K9 for Last Christmas

K9, with his first wife.

Doctor Who‘s Lead Writer and Executive Producer Steven Moffat has been chatting exclusively to UK television listings magazine, TV & Satellite Week. During the interview Steven was asked about a return for for former companion K-9, to which he replied:

“I love K-9! I nearly put him in Last Christmas.

I had a whole scene where the Doctor was pointing out how ludicrous Santa Claus is, having a reindeer with a glowing nose and so on… and then in comes K-9.

Completely daft, but he’s brilliant. I’m totally up for K-9 when we have the right idea.”

Steven, who also hints at a project outside Doctor Who and Sherlock (but is currently too busy for for a while), also discusses leaving the show:

“I thought I’d be gone by now, to be honest. I thought I would get tired by it, and of it. But I haven’t. If anything, I think I cope with the stress and fatigue better than I used to.

So I take it a year at a time. But they might decide that they’ve had enough of me and kick me out!”

Steven also goes on to describe Clara’s exit in Doctor Who Series 9 as “traumatic” and does not rule out a return for the Mondasian Cybermen, stating it’s not “impossible”. The full interview can be read in the current issue of TV & Satellite Week, on sale now.
