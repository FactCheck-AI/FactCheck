K-9 Adventures will feature a new-look version of the trusty robo-dog

Doctor Who's robotic dog K9 is to get its own TV spin-off featuring a mixture of live action and computer animation.

Children's TV channel Jetix Europe is joining forces with former Doctor Who designer Paul Tams and K9 co-creator Bob Baker for the 26-instalment series.

Baker, co-writer of the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit feature film, said he was "delighted to be giving K-9 a new lease of life and a new look".

The original K9 appeared on Doctor Who between 1977 and 1981.

He subsequently appeared in a 1981 one-off show, K9 and Company, and 1983 special The Five Doctors.

'Space fantasy-adventure'

The metallic canine is set to make a guest appearance in this week's instalment of the current Doctor Who series alongside former doctor's assistant Sarah Jane Smith, played by Elisabeth Sladen.

John Leeson provided the voice of the original K-9

According to industry newspaper Broadcast, the BBC opted out of the K9 series in order to concentrate on its own upcoming Doctor Who spin-off, Torchwood.

Michael Lekes of Jetix Europe said the new series, to be called K9 Adventures, would be "an excellent space fantasy-adventure series that we are sure will be immensely popular".

"K9 holds a very special place in the hearts of all Doctor Who fans." added Jim Howell of distributors Park Entertainment.
