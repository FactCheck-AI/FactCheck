The Southeast Asia office opened in 2018 and is located in the bustling city of Makati, Metro Manila. Our teammates hail from countries across the Southeast Asia region and beyond. We work on projects across a diverse range of sectors and regions, including education, public health, economic development, and circular economy. Most recently, we have partnered with city and national level government departments in the Philippines to support COVID-response efforts and promote evidence-based policymaking in key sectors such as public health, transportation, and trade and industry.

Coming from diverse backgrounds and personalities, we get together for various cultural celebrations and wellness activities. We have a fun, tight-knit culture in and outside of the office with the team regularly celebrating personal wins and milestones together.
