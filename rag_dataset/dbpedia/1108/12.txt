The Chantoozies are an Australian pop group, formed in 1986. The group featured four female vocalists: Eve von Bibra, Angie La Bozzetta, Ally Fowler and Tottie Goldsmith, and four male musicians: Brett Goldsmith (bass guitars, keyboards, programming), Scott Griffiths (keyboards, programming), Frank McCoy (guitars, vocals) and David Reyne (drums, backing vocals). Their name is an intentional mispronunciation of the French word for a female singer, "chanteuse".
