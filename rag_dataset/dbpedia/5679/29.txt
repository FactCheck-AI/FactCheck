Easy Piano - Level 2 - Digital Download

SKU: A0.870537

By 3 Of Hearts. By Eddie Carswell and Leonard Ahlstrom. Arranged by Christina Fordham. Contemporary. Score. 7 pages. Christina Fordham Vera #4895887. Published by Christina Fordham Vera (A0.870537).

This is an early intermediate solo piano arrangement of The Christmas Shoes, written by Eddie Carswell and Leonard Ahlstrom, made famous by the 2000 release by Billy Goodwin and his band NewSong, and released in 2001 by the group 3 of Hearts.

This arrangement is for solo piano with the right hand playing the melody. It also contains the lyrics for the entire song.

As a professional pianist and piano instructor, I have found that many arrangements of this song are either too difficult for my students with difficult key signatures, left hand stretches and sixteenth notes, or they are too simple and do not include the left hand chord structure at all. Often they also do not include the lyrics. I've created this arrangement to bridge the gap between sounding like the original and being accessible for beginning to intermediate piano players. Thank you for supporting local artists and I hope you enjoy!
