Celebrity photographer/director David LaChapelle backed out of directing the music video for Madonna‘s song “Hung Up” because she is “nasty” towards employees.

LaChapelle, who directed the cult film Rize about dancers in South Central Los Angeles, chose not to put himself in a situation where he wasn’t enjoying himself.

He explains, “I had written the scenario, was paid for the concept.

“But after Rize, when I started to analyze what made me happy or not, I understood that she was not the person with whom I wished to collaborate.

“She is nice when you are alone with her, but when you work for her, she can be very… nasty. She is (nasty) with people she employs. I didn’t want to be tortured.

“I don’t have anything against difficulties, but there that would have been unpleasant. I would not have had fun. There is a part of cruelty in her.”
