A few weeks ago, it was 20 years since the release of Beyond: Good and Evil, a title that many players associate with Ubisoftâ€™s The Legend of Zelda. A very special game that was originally released on PS2, GameCube, Xbox and PC on November 11th, 2003. You know who remembers it? Ubisoft, because a remaster has just been leaked and its release is supposed to be imminent, although the same company has already asked us for a little patience on their social media.

Beyond Good & Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition, as this new version with improved graphics that will include 4K resolution and 60 FPS is called, has temporarily appeared in the Microsoft Store for Xbox consoles, although its tab was deleted shortly after. What remains intact is its achievements page for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One on Exophase, the portal that collects and lists achievements and trophies.

There is no record of trophies for PS5 or PS4, nor for Steam, so we will have to wait for its official announcement to know the platforms on which it will be released. That and its release date, although the fact that the achievements are published has made many people speculate with a possible surprise release.

The Game Awards 2023, the ideal stage?
