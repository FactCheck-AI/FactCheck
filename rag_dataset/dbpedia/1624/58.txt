Nikon will be spending ¥25 billion ($160M) on consolidating lens manufacture into two new buildings in Tochigi Prefecture to focus on high-end lenses:

“Nikon is renovating its camera lens factory in Japan. It will consolidate the manufacturing facilities, which were previously divided into more than a dozen locations at its base in Tochigi Prefecture, into two new buildings. The number of interchangeable camera lenses sold has shrunk to about one-tenth of its peak. The company will focus on high-end lenses domestically and make the factory more resistant to fluctuations in demand by being able to flexibly change production items.” (source: Nikkei, thanks Matt_007)
