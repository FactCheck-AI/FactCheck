Alfred Hitchcock is usually credited with directing 53 films, but he was also involved with dozens of other films and an iconic television series. The following is, we hope, a complete list of his oeuvre.

Films are listed in chronological order of production, which occasionally differs from the order of release in the country of production. The year of release is taken from the Internet Movie Database and may not exactly match other published Hitchcock filmographies.
