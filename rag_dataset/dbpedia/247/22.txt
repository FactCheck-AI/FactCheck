Wisconsin Genealogy

Karen Duffy has a book �Who�s Who in Polish America� published in 1943 and edited by Rev. Francis Bolek. It�s also available at many libraries, including the Milwaukee Central Branch. I�m attaching the list of WI names in the book. People who are interested can contact Karen for a copy of the short biography or they can check the library for a copy. Karen's email can be found on the contributors' page under Polish transcriptions and surnames.
