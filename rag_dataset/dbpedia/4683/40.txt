The international service of the Sri Lankan Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) recently doubled its Tamil Service airtime to two hours, on 873 kHz AM (medium wave) from Puttalam transmitter. The new schedule is 0130-0330 UTC (7.00 am to 9.00 am IST).

This is partly in response to individual efforts of listeners, many in the southern part of India, in Bengaluru.

Introducing this change, Colombo International Radio also announced that shortly they are going to use DRM on 1548 kHz.

This will be done by using the old transmitter of Deutsche Welle located in the north of Sri Lanka at Trincomalee. The Sri Lankan public broadcaster has started airing the DRM announcement here.

The publicity for the new DRM service is also in full swing. See video:
