The Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as the JR Group (JRグループ, Jeiāru Gurūpu) or simply JR, is a group of railway companies in Japan that underwent division and privatization[1] of the government-owned Japanese National Railways (JNR) on April 1, 1987. It consists of six passenger railway companies, one freight railway company, and two non-service companies. Most of the liability of the JNR was assumed by the JNR Settlement Corporation.

The JR Group operates a large proportion of intercity rail service (including the Shinkansen high-speed rail lines) and commuter rail service.
