A post-modern adaptation of Alan Martin and Jamie Hewlettâ€™s legendary post-apocalyptic comic, TANK GIRL features an infectiously unhinged performance from Lori Petty in the title role. In a dystopic future where the world is controlled by an evil mega-corp, the only way to fight them is to become the craziest, most chaotic, bad-ass anti-heroine on the planet.
