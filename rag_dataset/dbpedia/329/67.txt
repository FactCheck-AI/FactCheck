The modern AAS instrument was pioneered by Sir Alan Walsh in the 1950s at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO). In Melbourne, Australia, whilst gardening one weekend Walsh realized that measuring the absorption of light was more valuable than observing the emission.

GBC Scientific Equipment was founded in 1978 by Ron Grey, Ivan Bartlett and Peter Charlton.
