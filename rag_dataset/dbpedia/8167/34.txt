In French, ‘tonton’ is a term of affection, most often used by a child when referring to an uncle. Here, the 15 ‘tontons’ are all rock and pop stars. The head and shoulders portraits in black and white are ‘full-on’ and ‘in-your-face’! Though not named, most are easily recognisable including Mick Jagger (KD), David Bowie (KH), Freddy Mercury (QS) and Tina Turner (QD). The indices are in French. A red microphone is included in the top left-hand corner of each of the Jokers. Paul McCartney and Jimi Hendrix are on the reverse.
