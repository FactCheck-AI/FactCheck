Party Introduction

Nationalist, Social-democratic party in favour of Scottish independence from the UK whilst supporting continued pooling of sovereignty in a more integrated and federalised European Union. Source: Wikipedia

In 1934 the centre-left National Party of Scotland and the centre-right Scottish Party formed to become the Scottish National Party, with Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham taking the first presidency.

The party is a Scottish Nationalist and social-democratic party, both supporting and campaigning for Scottish independence, and is the third largest political party in terms of membership in the UK, with more than 92,000 members.

Six of the 59 Scottish seats in Westminster are held by the SNP, along with two MEPs in the European Parliament, sitting in The Greens/European Free Alliance group.

Current leader of the SNP is Nicola Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond who stepped down after the Scottish Independence referendum in 2014. Sturgeon was the only candidate confirmed (it was apparent that no other candidate would receive the required nominations), and by becoming the leader of the Scottish National party was the first woman to be both First Minister for Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party.

The party ideology aligns with mainstream European social democratic traditions, commitments to same-sex marriage, unilateral nuclear disarmament, progressive personal taxation, reducing the voting age to sixteen and investment in renewable energy.
