Laurent Ferrier is a true master with an understated aesthetic, and technical ingenuity that is rooted in the classic traditions of the past, but with a modern appeal. A trained watchmaker, he spent almost 40 years working at Patek Philippe in product development before creating his own brand, where he introduced his superb tourbillon wristwatch, the Galet Classique Tourbillon Double Spiral in 2010. Since then, he has produced other ground-breaking complicated timepieces including the Galet Minute Repeater and the Galet Traveller, which is Ferrier’s modern reinterpretation of Patek Philippe’s renowned reference 2597 travel-time watch.

The present pink gold Galet Traveler is an ultra-exclusive 5 piece limited series in pink gold made for London based retailer William & Son.

The dial, executed in champlevé enamel depicts the night sky over the globe. The enameller’s attention to detail has gone so deep that the artist has even painted the night lights of each region, with the UK being subtly painted in red.

The two buttons on the case side move the hour hand backward or forward by one hour to set time in a new time zone, home time being elegantly displayed via an aperture at 9 o’clock, the date is displayed at 3 o’clock.

Not only a pretty face, the Galet Traveller also features a double direct-impulse natural escapement (an escapement devised by Breguet in the late 18th century and which very few watchmakers have managed to recreate) using two nickel phosphorous escape wheels and a silicon lever as ensuring better distribution of energy. The movement is also further beautifully hand decorated to the nth degree with a beautiful tapered rotor bridge, polished angles and Geneva waves.
