When DJ Khaled starts putting in work, he doesn't let up. He drops the Gil Green-directed video for "Hold You Down" — which features Chris Brown, XXL Freshman August Alsina, Future and Jeremih — just hours after the song dropped.

As you'd guess by the featured artists, this one is for the ladies. The video follows accordingly as the singers woo ladies inside a mansion. It also includes this ridiculous bit of dialogue between DJ Khaled and a model.

"Say my name, baby."

"DJ Khaled"

"Say my naammmee, baby!"

"DJ Khaled"

"You smart. You loyal. You're grateful. I appreciate that. Go buy your mom a house. Go buy your whole family houses. Put this money in your savings account. Go spend money for no reason."

Not a single dry eye in the room.
