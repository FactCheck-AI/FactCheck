Biography

Dr. Donald Grant is an adjunct professor of psychology at GSEP and psychologist in the Child Welfare Division of the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. Grant and his team ensure the timely and appropriate delivery of mental health services for children under the supervision of the Department of Children and Family Services.

Grant's early career as a middle school science teacher in Baltimore, Maryland, crystalized his passion for supporting marginalized youth and minimizing their risk factors. Since then he has directed this interest toward developing and conducting workshops and symposia to improve the life functioning of disenfranchised communities.

Grant has presented across the country at universities, mental health conferences, school district functions, and community events. Some of his lectures have included: "The Black, the Homeless, and the Forgotten;" "Increasing Mental Healthcare Maintenance Practices in Black Families;" and Promoting Success for Minority Students Attending American Colleges and Universities.

Grant is working on his first publication, Everyday Thoughts by Everyday Black Men, a compilation of 100 articles and essays written by black men across the globe. It is edited with a historical and psychosocial foundation, and aimed at diversifying the monolithic presentation of the Black Manâ€™s voice in modern society.

Grant also trains clinicians and educators by serving as adjunct faculty at several Southern California colleges.
