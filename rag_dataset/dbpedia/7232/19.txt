The concept of motivation seems abstract to some, especially business leaders who are intrinsically motivated by success.

But building a thorough understanding of what motivates our teams, our customers and even ourselves is a great way to change habits and processes which may be stunting the growth of our businesses…or at least a good way to make our lives easier and find our way out of a motivation rut when we find ourselves in one.

Daniel Pink has written some great books which give a fantastic insight into the phycology of business. Drive offers an often surprising look at why the widely accepted concept of motivation is fundamentally flawed and what the truth is on the matter.

Best for…

Studying the core of motivational theory can benefit anyone. This book will help you get a better grip on how to keep yourself productive and feeling satisfied with your work.

Drive is a perfect read for those in marketing roles who want to better understand what motives their customers, or even better gain a better understanding of how to get influencers to engage with your brand.

Obviously, this is also a great book for anyone who manages a team and wants to boost their drive for success.
