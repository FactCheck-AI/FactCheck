Surely the most mysterious of all old German Metal-labels and probably the one discography that has taken the longest for me to complete.

DS/D&S was basically a home studio owned by Hattingen-resident Michael Jesch. On the early compilations credits were merely given to DS Recording, while the D&S Records-imprint wasn't used until the later band releases, the NINJA lp being the first.

The editions of the albums were small, but probably not as small as "a few hundred copies" as some collector-hype has been claiming through the years - most likely the scarcity of releases like Courage or The Best Of German Metal Newcomer is due to other factors.

In the early 90's DS became a CD-only label and while some of those releases are considered collectables, I won't delve into that part of the label's history atm, hence this list ends with their last vinyl LP release. I've also come across a couple of D&S 7"s with a different cat# system, but since only one of them have been even close to Metal I've only featured the one atm...

Finally there's the sublabels Schr√§gton Records and Beat The Record. While they're perhaps not to be considered DS-releases per se, they do explain those "missing" catalogue numbers and for this reason I've squeezed in the titles in the list below for clarification.
