Ramanaidu, who was never a bright student in school, dropped out of college and joined his father's rice mill and bus transport business at a very young age in his birthplace Karamchedu.

Ramanaidu, who was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, passed away at a private hospital. His body is being shifted to his studio for public to pay their last respects," the veteran's publicist told IANS.

His first stint with the cinema world was through a production agency called Shambu Films. He forced his father to invest in this company and subsequently got himself familiarised with the production process.

Daggubati Ramanaidu's film journey, which lasted for five glorious decades, can inspire many generations to come.

Interestingly, Ramanaidu entered the filmdom as an actor by landing a brief role in 1959 Telugu drama Nammina Bantu", starring Akkineni Nageswara Rao.
