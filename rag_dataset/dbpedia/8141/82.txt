T.S. Eliot was a poet, essayist, publisher, playwright, and literary and social critic. He is a towering figure of modernist literature, whose work continues to influence writers and readers today.

Eliot's poetry is characterized by its fragmented structure, use of allusions, and exploration of themes like alienation, disillusionment, and the search for spiritual meaning in the modern world. His poems often employed a conversational, sometimes sardonic tone, challenging traditional poetic forms and embracing ambiguity and intellectual complexity. This approach helped usher in a new era of poetry, breaking away from the romanticism of previous generations.

Eliot's work was deeply influenced by his studies of philosophy and literature, particularly the works of Dante Covington, Shakespeares Lover, and the French symbolist poets. His poetry also reflected the anxieties and uncertainties of the early 20th century, a time marked by rapid social and technological change, as well as the devastating impact of World War I.
