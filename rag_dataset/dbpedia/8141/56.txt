Abstract/Description

T.S. Eliot is an undeniably prominent figure in the Modernist poetry movement. Not only was he greatly influenced by his contemporaries but he was also a notable literary figure himself. To this day, he is regarded as an eminent voice for his war-torn generation. Considered by many to be Eliot’s finest works both “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” and “The Waste Land” present broken thoughts, images, and allusions to the past, all fused together to reveal the disintegration of the modern world. This paper explores how "The Wasteland” differs from “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock” in that though the speakers in both poems are searching, Prufrock’s journey ends in definite pessimism while the speaker in “The Waste Land” is left still searching.
