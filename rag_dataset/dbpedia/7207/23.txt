A mouse living in the cellar of Sherlock Holmes’s house is himself a brilliant detective in this mystery inspired by the Basil of Baker Street books by Eve Titus and Paul Galdone. Four directors collaborated on this charming animated feature, including Disney veteran Burny Mattinson and the team of John Musker and Ron Clements (The Little Mermaid, Aladdin), while Vincent Price loaned his unmistakable voice to the evil Professor Ratigan. The lighthearted and varied score was composed by four-time Oscar winner Henry Mancini, his first for an animated feature.
