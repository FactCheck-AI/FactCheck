This table shows all the Registration District (RD) and Registration Sub-district (SD) names and numbers, in the archival piece number order in which they appear, in the 1921 Census of England & Wales. As with the earlier censuses of England & Wales, the piece sequencing starts in London and works outwards and northwards through England, before turning to south and then north Wales.

Many family historians will know the Registration District names from their experience of using the General Register Office’s birth, marriage and death indexes. The Registration Sub-district names are less well known. Even experienced genealogists are unlikely to know the RD and SD numbers but these can be a useful shorthand when searching.

Knowing RD and SD names and numbers can prove handy, for instance by enabling you to research an area smaller than a county but larger than a parish. For example, we can see that Guisborough (RD No 534) contains five SDs – Loftus, Skelton, Marske, Guisborough itself and Danby. Those SDs will contain the town after which they are named together with their catchment area of smaller villages and settlements.

Note that in 1921 there was no RD 13 or RD 376.

The Channel Islands and Isle of Man follow at the end of the sequence but, strictly speaking, are outside the RD and SD administrative geography. The SD Nos shown for the Isle of Man are in fact parish numbers. However, it is useful to have an overview of the administrative districts used in the taking of the 1921 Census in the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.
