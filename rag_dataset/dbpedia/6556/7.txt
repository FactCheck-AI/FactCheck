Indie Wire

"Ritchie pumps this story full of enough cheeky rodomontade that it's able to stay afloat on the strength of its own meat-headed bluster, and eventually sail back to England on the residual breeze of the better movie it could have been."

The Hollywood Reporter

"It's moderately entertaining because there's a fascinating historical footnote at the root of it, but the execution doesn't maximise the story's potential.”"

The Wrap

"The whole cast is having a wonderful time. It's a hangout movie about taking down white supremacists, en masse and with violent glee. It's hard not to get swept up in this film's simple pleasures."

Variety

"The movie relies on a terrific ensemble in nearly all its lead roles… Ritchson - between his homoerotic flirting and homicidal flair - seems destined to be the fan favourite."

Mashable

"The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare has its moments, harkening back to the winsome rogues and madcap mayhem of Ritchie's early gems, like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch."
