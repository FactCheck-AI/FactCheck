Parents need to know that What Dreams May Come is a 1998 movie in which Robin Williams plays a man killed in a car crash who must leave heaven to rescue his wife from hell after she commits suicide. The movie doesn't shy away from emotional intensity, especially with parents trying to cope with the tragic deaths of their children, as well as the wife later trying to cope with the untimely death of her husband. As if the deaths of children and a father weren't enough, there's also talk in the movie of a father with his kids about how it's time to put their dog to sleep. The demonic imagery of hell will be too intense for younger and more sensitive viewers -- evocations of wailing and screaming damned souls trapped in lakes and buried up to their necks in mud (featuring a cameo from the director Werner Herzog). Talk of suicide -- a woman has visible scars from trying to slit her wrist. Talk of divorce. Talk of mental and emotional instability. Some profanity, including use of "f--k." Cigarette smoking. A bird defecates paint on the lead character; the colors splatter off his shoulder. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails.
