A lot of bands throughout history have started in art school – fewer have started their life as actual art. But that’s the story of Dream Wife, a new trio featuring Icelandic singer and artist Rakel Mjöll, whose face might well be familiar to watchers of the Reykjavík arts scene.

After relocated to Brighton to attend art school, Rakel met her bandmates Alice and Bella, and the three formed Dream Wife as an “imaginary band,” for an art project. But when it became clear there was some potential and chemistry at work, Dream Wife transitioned from fiction into reality.

Now, their first single, “Believe”, is here. Presented as a video art collaboration with Maisie Cousins, the track is four minutes of rough disco that’s described by the band themselves as “poolside pop with a bite”. The three flit through the fashion decades, grabbing whatever they like along the way.
