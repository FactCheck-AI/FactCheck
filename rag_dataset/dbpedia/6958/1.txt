Broadening its palette of services for its independent and artist-operated labels, indie distributor INgrooves Fontana has established an in-house marketing and promotion division, INresidence Artist Services.

Bryan Mead has been installed as senior vp of the unit. Mead was previously senior vp of marketing at Fontana Distribution, Universal Music Group’s onetime indie distribution arm, which was acquired by San Francisco-based digital distrib INgrooves in March (Daily Variety, March 5).

INresidence will supply the distrib’s select clients with product management, radio and video promotion, sync licensing, online marketing, publicity support and branding and sponsorship services. Many boutique or artist-run operations don’t have the wherewithal to provide such services for their acts.

INgrooves Fontana prexy Dave Zierler noted in a statement, “As more artists release music independently and independent labels look to become more efficient, we see an opportunity to provide our clients with the centralized resources to more effectively develop their projects given the new realities of the marketplace.”

Based at INgrooves Fontana’s L.A. offices, the INresidence division currently has a dedicated staff of six and will expand in the coming months.

U.K. singer-songwriter Kate Nash’s Have 10p Records is the first to use the service, and will promote her just-released EP “Death Proof” and a 2013 full-length album through the division.

Nash is partnered with crowd-funding firm PledgeMusic, which announced an alliance with INgrooves Fontana in July (Daily Variety, July 20). Fans who participate in Nash’s PledgeMusic campaign will get access to the album-making process and members-only content.
