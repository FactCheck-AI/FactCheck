ABOUT BADFINGER

BADFINGER is the most successful recording act signed to The Beatles' label — APPLE RECORDS.

The original lineup included Pete Ham, Tommy Evans, Mike Gibbins and Joey Molland who joined in late 1969, when "The Iveys" rebranded as "BADFINGER." They interacted in various ways with each member of The Beatles, including during their solo careers. Paul McCartney wrote and produced the band's first single — "Come And Get It." Joey and Tommy played acoustic guitars on John Lennon's "Jealous Guy" and "I Don't Want To Be A Soldier, Momma" on his Imagine Album. Pete and Tommy contributed backup vocals on Ringo Starr's "It Don't Come Easy." The entire original BADFINGER lineup contributed to George Harrison's landmark triple album set, "All Things Must Pass" and the equally groundbreaking fundraising event, The Concert For Bangladesh. Their top 10 hits worldwide include "Come and get it", "No matter what", "Day after day", "Baby blue" and "Without you," which was covered by both Harry Nilsson (1972) and Mariah Carey (1994) and each time went to #1.
