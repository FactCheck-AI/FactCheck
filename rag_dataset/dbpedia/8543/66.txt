Sole-surviving Badfinger member Joey Molland has teamed up with Ringo Starr's former producer Mark Hudson for his first new album in over 10 years, called Be True To Yourself. Hudson, who was Ringo's primary collaborator for over a decade, is also revered for his power pop instincts and his work with Aerosmith and Ozzy Osbourne.

For the new set, which drops on October 16th, Molland has enlisted the help of Micky Dolenz, Wings drummer Steve Holley, former-Chicago bassist Jason Scheff, along with Julian Lennon â€” who also supplied the album's cover photo.
