A native of Liverpool, England, Joey Molland is the sole remaining member of the group Badfinger from their most successful period in the early 1970s. He shared lead guitar duties with Pete Ham, wrote songs, and sang. This is an in depth interview in two parts.

In part one he shares memories of his early years in Liverpool, seeing the Beatles at the Cavern Club, playing guitar on the street corner on Penny Lane, working the local clubs, and joining Badfinger and recording with George Harrison as the group’s producer. We also talk about slide guitar and various recordings.

In part two he shares memories of playing at Madison Square Garden on the Concert for Bangladesh, doing session work at John Lennon’s house on the Imagine album, and much more. We also preview his recent album Return To Memphis.

Mentioned by Joey, the Rollings Stones manager caught his band doing this song at the Blue Angel in Liverpool and brought them to London to record it. It did make the charts and the band played on the television program Ready, Steady, Go along with the Rolling Stones seen below in a very unusual clip.

Shortly after joining Badfinger Joey on an early television appearance, although this was recorded prior to his arrival in the band (notice he is holding a bass guitar.)
