Here's The Black Crowes entry in Wikipedia:

"The Black Crowes are an American, blues-oriented hard rock jam band that has sold over 20 million albums. They were hailed by Melody Maker as "The Most Rock 'n' Roll Rock 'n' Roll Band in the World". In 1990, the readers of Rolling Stone named it the 'Best New American Band'. The band has toured with acts such as Aerosmith, Jimmy Page, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Who, AC/DC, The Grateful Dead, and Neil Young. The Crowes - as fans refer to them - are listed at #92 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock"."
