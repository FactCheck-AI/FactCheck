About Ex Machina

Unfurling the layers of mind-bending cinema, Ex Machina, a remarkable film from 2014, stands as a testament to the prowess of its director, Alex Garland. The film features the compelling performances of talented actors Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, and Oscar Isaac, who bring this chilling sci-fi psychological thriller to life.

The plot centers on programming engineer Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), chosen by his CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), to administer the Turing test of an intelligent humanoid robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander). As Caleb draws nearer to Ava, the mysteries about Nathan's true intentions become more sinister. Within its enthralling plot, Ex Machina deftly explores profound questions about the nature of consciousness, AI, and the morality of creating sentient beings.

The film's original narrative and groundbreaking special effects were well-received. Its genius went global, earning it nods at prestigious awards, including the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, and the British Academy Film Awards.

Ex Machina has been well-received by critics, with an average score of 8.2 out of 10, according to the prominent review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. While the site's general opinion is that the film's intellectual substance is more important than the special effects, most reviewers agree that it's a visually beautiful and fascinating science fiction film. The picture received a 78 out of 100 score on Metacritic, another site aggregating reviews using a weighted average method.

Ex Machina Locations

The breathtaking locales that director Alex Garland has brought to life in this stunning exploration of AI serve as integral parts of the story. Many of the sequences were filmed in Norway, a country known for its stunning landscapes, while others were set in London, a metropolis that starkly contrasts the serene Norway.

You can see the spectacular Norwegian landscape in two key spots. One is the private Fjora House, which offers a memorable view from the living room outward as the building's architecture harmonizes with the lofty rock upon which it rests. The Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway is the second site; it is a glass-walled sanctuary with wonderful views of the Norwegian landscape and an architectural harmony between man and environment.

The stunning Norwegian landscapes serve as more than simply a cinematic background; they also give the story its unique allure. Several Ex Machina scenes were also filmed in the Bloomberg finance firm offices at 50 Finsbury Square.

Visiting these locales allows one to experience Ex Machina's breathtaking scenery, architecture, and lively urban life while reliving the film's cinematic genius. Any traveler, movie buff, or cinephile at heart will enjoy visiting these locations.

A young programmer, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), is informed at his office that he has been selected to spend a week with the mysterious CEO of the company, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). All of the subsequent plot points in the film are established in this sequence.

The sleek and modern office where Caleb works is the Bloomberg financial company's office located at 50 Finsbury Square, London. This striking building was constructed in 2000 by Norman Foster & Partners, making it an exciting blend of history and modernity.

While interior visits to the office are not available to the public, fans of Ex Machina can still appreciate the exterior of the building. To get to this location, you can take the tube to Moorgate Station, which is only a short walk from Finsbury Square.

Caleb is airlifted into a vast reserve owned by Nathan, his company's enigmatic CEO. Caleb is left to navigate through the dense woodland to Nathan's secluded residence. Upon arrival, he's greeted by an automated system that issues him a key card and grants him access to the house. Initially bewildered and left to roam the house alone, Caleb finds Nathan working out.

The stunning exterior of Nathan's house, as seen in the film, is the Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway. This remote hotel is uniquely designed to blend seamlessly into its natural surroundings. Each room is constructed with a low profile, offering guests an unobstructed view of the breathtaking valley surrounding the property. The landscape rooms consist of seven small 'cubes' elevated on stilts, seamlessly merging with the surrounding natural scenery. They offer stunning vistas of the river, courtyard, valley, or the gorge below.

For fans of Ex Machina, a visit to the Juvet Landscape Hotel provides an opportunity to immerse themselves in the captivating setting of the movie. The hotel is still operational, allowing fans to book a stay and experience the serene beauty of the location firsthand.

To reach the Juvet Landscape Hotel from Oslo, you can fly to Ã lesund Airport. From there, it's about a two-hour drive to the hotel. If you're coming from Bergen, you can take a ferry to Fodnes and then drive to the hotel, which will take approximately five hours.

Caleb discovers that the TV in his room doubles as a CCTV network, providing him with a live feed of Ava (Alicia Vikander) in her habitat. During a sudden blackout, Caleb sets out to find Nathan and eventually locates him in a state of drunken irritability. Nathan dismisses the power cuts and assures Caleb that he is "looking into it."

This scene unfolds in a remarkable house that marries the architectural designs of two distinct structuresâthe Fjora House and the Juvet Landscape Hotel. Both buildings are the brainchild of the same Norwegian architectural duo, Jensen & Skodvin, and they're skillfully unified on the screen to create a single, stunning residence.

Fjora House, a private residence built in 2014, is particularly distinctive for its integration with the surrounding rock formation. The rock cuts into the corners of the living room and the plate glass windows, creating a unique and striking design feature. The house overlooks the beautiful Rusetbugen inlet, offering spectacular views of the natural landscape.

To get to this location, you can take a flight to Oslo, Norway, and then a connecting flight to Ã lesund. From Ã lesund, it's about a two-hour drive to the Valldal area, where the Fjora House is located. Additionally, Juvet Landscape Hotel is located nearby, only 20 minutes via Fv63.

Nathan and Caleb step away from the high-tech confines of the house to take a hike near a waterfall. This moment offers a brief yet poignant contrast between the film's overarching themes of artificial intelligence and nature's raw, unfiltered beauty.

This scene occurs near the majestic GrÃ¸nfossen Waterfall in GrÃ¸ndalen, a breathtaking natural gem around three hoursâ drive from the Juvet Hotel and south of Route E136. The roaring waterfall at Lesjaskog provides a tranquil backdrop for the characters' interactions, highlighting the stark difference between their artificial environment and the untamed beauty of the natural world.

The GrÃ¸nfossen Waterfall is a stunning filming location and an idyllic spot for outdoor activities such as hiking and biking. The path to the waterfall is signposted from the bicycle trail that runs around Lesjaskogsvatnet, making it easily accessible for visitors.

From Ã lesund, it's approximately a two-and-a-half-hour drive along the picturesque Route E136 to reach the GrÃ¸ndalen area. The waterfall is a short hike from the main road, with clear signage directing visitors.

Caleb and Ava develop a bond as they spend more time together. This connection intensifies when Ava adorns herself in clothes to appear more human to Caleb. Confused yet intrigued, Caleb confides in Nathan, suspecting that Ava has been programmed to flirt with him. Infuriated by this suggestion, Nathan leads Caleb to his lab, where Ava was created.

The interior scenes, like the observation room where Caleb monitors Ava while Nathan supervises, were built on stage at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire. The studios employed blue-screen technology to incorporate the Norwegian landscape into the scenes through the windows, ensuring continuity with the outdoor settings.

Pinewood Studios, a distinguished institution in the film industry, has been turning dreams into reality for over 85 years. The studio has served as the base for numerous productions ranging from large-scale films to television programs, commercials, and pop promos. It is renowned for hosting iconic film franchises such as James Bond. However, it's worth noting that Pinewood Studios is not typically open to the public. Only pre-authorized visitors are permitted entry.

To reach Pinewood Studios, take a train from London to Gerrards Cross or Slough, followed by a taxi ride to the studios. Alternatively, the studios are located just off the M40 and M25 motorways if you're driving.
