Watching Amy Berg's powerful documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a wrenching experience; her subjects reveal to the camera almost unbearable levels of anguish, and its audience walks away feeling both numbness and rage.

Arizona RepublicBill Muller

Deliver Us Evil is more terrifying than any horror movie, because it's about something that really happened.

Detroit NewsTom Long

What truly sets Deliver Us from Evil apart from other documentaries is interviews with the monster himself.

Detroit Free PressTerry Lawson

Even people who reject the idea of inherent evil may be shaken by Berg's scrupulous yet passionate recounting of the story of Oliver O'Grady.

Chicago TribuneMichael Phillips

Deliver Us From Evil has a few things wrong with it, including an egregious musical score, but without resorting to sucker punches, it takes your breath away while making your skin crawl.

San Francisco ChronicleRuthe Stein

The church declined to comment to Berg. Her film speaks volumes about its silence -- and about a wrong that can never be righted.

Philadelphia InquirerCarrie Rickey

If Berg's movie were a newspaper story, it would win the Pulitzer Prize for public service.

New York TimesA.O. Scott

Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg's film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority.

New York PostLou Lumenick

This superb documentary about the Catholic Church's worst pedophile scandal is in many ways far scarier than any fiction.

AV ClubScott Tobias

In a major coup, director Amy Berg convinced O'Grady to appear in [Deliver Us From Evil], and his testimony reveals a man who's chillingly divorced from the full weight of his actions.

New York Daily NewsJack Mathews

O'Grady appears in the film, his face showing no sign of shame even as he acknowledges and describes the awful things he did.

Boston GlobeTy Burr

Grander statements aren't needed when the specific indictments are so plentiful and so horrifying.

Washington PostDesson Thomson

Works best when it concentrates on O'Grady and the ever-rippling effect of his transgressions.

TIME MagazineRichard Schickel

It cries from and for the hearts of victims and leaves its viewers moved, shattered, outraged. And impotent in the face of the ugliness visited on the souls of good and innocent people.

Ebert & RoeperRichard Roeper

One of the best and most important documentaries you'll ever see.

USA TodayClaudia Puig

Deliver Us From Evil will shake you to your marrow. It should be seen by people of all faiths and by anyone concerned about the wellbeing of children.

SlateDana Stevens

It's a howl of rage and a keen-eyed study of a subject that, unfortunately, never stops being news: the way institutional power acts as a shield under whose cover the strong can abuse the weak.

NewsdayGene Seymour

Berg, a veteran of both CBS News and CNN, carefully and calmly assembles a devastating case against church officials' mendacity.
