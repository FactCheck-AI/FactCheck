Soldiers in the National Guard serve both community and country. Their normal requirements are to serve for one weekend per month, and for a two-week training period once per year. They are activated as needed to respond to domestic emergencies, reconstruction missions, training international partner nations, overseas missions, counter-drug efforts, and more. The Guard always responds with speed, strength and efficiency, helping to defend American freedom and ideals. They are Citizen-Soldiers.

Each State and U.S. territory has its own National Guard. As a National Guard Soldier, your primary area of operation is your home state. The state governor or the President can call on the Guard at a moment’s notice. Typically, Guard Soldiers live at home, where they can be near friends and family while holding a civilian job.
