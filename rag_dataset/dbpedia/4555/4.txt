ARLINGTON, Texas -- Seeking to attract new talent and fill critical civilian positions, U.S. Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) staff engaged with job seekers at the first-ever Total Army Career Fair held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas, on April 13, 2024.

This groundbreaking event marked a significant milestone in the Army's recruiting efforts, as it combined active Army, National Guard, Army Reserve, and civilian resources under one roof to recruit top talent. The career fair was open to the public, targeting job seekers nationwide.

“The Total Army Career Fair is an exceptional event that highlights job opportunities as Soldiers or Army civilians. The U.S. Army is an employer of choice,” said Roy A. Wallace, U.S. Army G-1 Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff.

Army Civilians play a critical role in the Army’s success, using their skills in over 500 career paths across many fields, including contracting, finance, cybersecurity, engineering, and beyond. With more than 265,000 employees, the Army Civilian workforce is one of the largest groups of Civilian employees within the Department of Defense and dates to the founding of our country in 1776.

“We are always looking for our Nation’s top talent. We offer rewarding career opportunities across the United States (to include Hawaii and Puerto Rico) and overseas in countries such as Germany, Italy, Japan and Korea,” said Oscar Bocanegra, MEDCOM Civilian Human Resources Director.

The Critical Need for Behavioral Health Professionals

One of the focal points of MEDCOM’s participation in the career fair was the urgent need to recruit top talent for Civilian positions in the areas of Behavioral Health, Medical, Human Resources, Financial Management, Security, Contracting, and STEM fields. The demand for skilled professionals in Behavioral Health, such as Social Workers, remains high as the Army continues to prioritize the mental well-being of its Soldiers and their families.

What Qualifications Are We Looking For?

The qualifications for these critical positions vary by field, but generally include relevant degrees, certifications, and work experience. For example, Behavioral health professionals typically need a master’s degree in social work, psychology, or counseling, along with appropriate state licensure and experience in clinical settings. Similarly, positions in support functions such as Human Resources and Financial Management require specialized education and/or experience.

Telework and Remote Opportunities

“Engaging with potential job seekers in Arlington, it is evident many are looking for telework and remote work opportunities. At MEDCOM, we are utilizing those flexibilities to the maximum extent possible to remain competitive in the job market,” emphasized Damaris Lerdo, MEDCOM, Civilian Human Resources Directorate (CHRD).
