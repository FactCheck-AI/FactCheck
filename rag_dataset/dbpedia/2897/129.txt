"Identify risks â€“ protect health": The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, or BfR for short, is a scientific institution of the Federal Republic of Germany. It prepares expert reports and opinions on questions of food, feed and chemical safety and consumer health protection based on internationally recognised scientific assessment criteria. The institute advises the Federal Government and the federal states in these areas. The BfR conducts its own research on topics that are closely linked to its assessment tasks. It is independent in its research, assessment and communication. With its work, the BfR makes a decisive contribution towards the protection of consumer health and the safety of food, substances and products.
