After these years of pandemic, it finally seems that we are returning to normal summers on the island and that we can go out to dance and enjoy in the discos Of Ibiza.

Almost all clubs have announced their Opening parties and much of their programming for this 2022 season, however, it seems that for now we will not be able to dance again at the Privilege Ibiza nightclub.

With its 6.500 square meters, its capacity for 10.00 people and its various indoor and outdoor spaces, Privilege Ibiza is considered the Largest nightclub in the world by the Guinness Book of Records and has been the venue for years of festivals as popular as SuperMartXÃ©, Brutal or Resistance.

Despite its long history since it opened its doors at the end of the 70s as Ku, it seems that, at least for now, the history of this famous club will be cut short this summer 2022 and we will not be able to continue dancing there.
