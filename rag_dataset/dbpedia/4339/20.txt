 Background Information. 252

José Domínguez de Mendoza was a soldier with the Leyva party which had gone to meet the Mexico City wagon-train at Guadalupe del Paso when the Indians struck the northern colony in 1680; in this recorded instance he signed his name without "Mendoza." But in the following year he used the full name, and was described as a bachelor, newly arrived from a trip to Parral, twenty-four years old, swarthy, with an aquiline face, coarse hair and beard. In 1682 he was mentioned as a native of New Mexico, the natural son of Ana Velásquez, when he asked to marry a Juana López. In that same year he ran away from the refugee colony, but must have returned or was apprehended, for he came to New Mexico with the Reconquest. In 1692 he rescued his sister Juana and her four daughters and one son from Indian captivity. He and Juana were some of the callados, or illegitimate children, of the Tomé Domínguez family.
