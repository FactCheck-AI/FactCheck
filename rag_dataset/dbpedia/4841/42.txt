William Ronald Cahill, 83, of Hillsboro, NH, peacefully passed away on Monday, February 18, 2019, at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, CT with his devoted companion and caregiver, Betty Ann (Patchen) Poll by his side, where she has been since 2003 when they began to share their lives together.

Ron was born December 26, 1935, and raised in Somerville, NJ, the son of the late Ernestine (Jassa) and Joseph Cahill. He attended Duquesne, Seton Hall and Rutgers University. He taught English and History in Hillsboro, NJ where he was proud to specialize in teaching about the Holocaust, and in Hillsboro, NH from where he retired in 1997.

A very well respected and intelligent man, he, along with his wife Betty, owned the Felsen House Kennels in New Jersey where they raised and showed dogs, and were the proud owners of an Irish Terrier who placed 3rd in the United States. Later, during 1984, he and his wife Betty opened The Other Ark Gift Shop in Hillsboro, NH, until, due to his declining health, the gift shop had to close during 2018.

In addition to Betty Ann, he is survived by his sons, Kevin Cahill (Jennifer) and Brian Cahill both of NJ and his sister, Marilyn Van Steelant of Newtown, PA. He is also survived by Betty Ann’s children, Peggy Vasile (Carmelo), Jennifer Abraham (Larry Martin), Peter Poll, (Stacey); and her grandchildren, Nicholas and Christian Vasile, Jacob Abraham, Anna, Josie, Madeline and Gabriel Poll, along with grand dogs Ollie, Charlie and Ginger. In addition to his wife Betty, Ron was preceded in death by his brother, Richard Cahill.

Private funeral services will be held in NH. Memorial contributions may be made to the Monadnock Humane Society, 101 West Swanzey Rd., Swanzey, NH 03446 (monadnockhumanesociety.org). Condolences may be sent to Ron’s family by visiting www.cookfuneralhomect.com
