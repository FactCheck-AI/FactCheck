A 7-year-old girl was killed Monday when her school bus backed over her after she was dropped off at home, authorities said. Lilian Velez, a pupil at Ben Sheppard Elementary School, had left her jacket on the bus and was trying to retrieve it when she was run over at about 3:45 p.m. in the driveway of her apartment complex, police said.

The driver turned back, said Fernando Forgueres, another pupil. "He hit her, then she fell. Then, he was going over her, and I think he thought it was a rock. Then, he looked out the window; he didn't see nothing, then he kept on."

The driver, Ramon Orosco of Hialeah Gardens, was cited for improper backing. Prosecutors will review the traffic investigation to determine whether charges will be filed, Hialeah police said.

Orosco, 61, has been a school bus driver for 20 years and worked for the elementary school for the past two months, said Lt. Omar Fernandez, a Hialeah Fire Department spokesman.

"He's extremely distraught," Fernandez said. "Until this whole thing is investigated completely, as serious as this is, we cannot even guess if anyone will be charged or not."

Children who witnessed the accident said the bus driver always had used the driveway to turn around.
