Darling of the Tory party Michael Portillo has stunned new leader Michael Howard by announcing he is to quit politics.

The news came as Mr Howard was this weekend putting the finishing touches to his shadow cabinet following his unopposed election on Thursday. But the Conservative frontbench team he announces will be missing two of the party's biggest names in Westminster.

Michael Portillo and Kenneth Clarke yesterday both ruled themselves out of a shadow cabinet job.

Mr Portillo shocked the political world by announcing he will quit Parliament at the next election, saying he had lost his appetite for the "cut and thrust" of the Commons and wanted to pursue a career possibly in the media. The former defence secretary said he had been offered a shadow cabinet post by Mr Howard.
