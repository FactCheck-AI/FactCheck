SANTOS: It is a final resting place fit for âThe Kingâ: six months after the death of the man widely considered the greatest footballer of all time, Brazil opened Peleâs gilded, football-turfed tomb to the public Monday.

Pele, who died on December 29 at age 82 after a battle with cancer, was laid to rest at the Ecumenical Memorial Cemetery in Santos, Brazil. It is a high-rise, 14-story mausoleum that holds the Guinness world record for the tallest cemetery on Earth.

Fans were greeted by two life-size golden statues of the player nicknamed âO Reiâ -- The King -- whose remains rest inside a large golden vault displayed in the middle of a 200-square-meter (more than 2,000-square-foot) room carpeted in artificial turf.

âIt surpassed my expectations. Itâs a really beautiful place,â said Ronaldo Rodrigues, 44, a businessman who was first in line to visit the tomb, along with his wife.

âI hope lots of tourists will come visit and get to know a little about Peleâs story, what he represented for Santos, Brazil and the entire world.â

Born Edson Arantes do Nascimento, Pele is the only player in history to win three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970).

He scored a world record 1,281 goals during his more than two-decade career with Santos (1956-74), the New York Cosmos (1975-77) and the Brazilian national team.

In tears, Peleâs son Edinho told reporters who flocked to the southeastern port city that the family was still struggling to cope with their loss.

âBut weâre also very proud and happy at all the affection and reverence thatâs kept pouring in,â he said.

For now, entries to the tomb are limited to 60 people a day, via a sign-up form on the cemeteryâs website.

Topped with a cross, Peleâs golden vault has black etchings on its sides depicting his 1,000th goal and his famous raised-fist goal celebration. The room is wallpapered with images of fans in a football stadium.

The resort-like cemetery also features an auto museum that now includes the Mercedes Benz S-280 the company gave Pele in 1974 to commemorate his 1,000th goal.

âItâs a place thatâs rich in detail, all lovingly assembled in tribute, as the âKingâ deserves,â cemetery manager Paulo Campos told AFP.
