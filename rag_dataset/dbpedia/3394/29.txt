When he arrived in the city of Recife, Brazil, in 1952 to shoot O canto do mar, filmmaker Alberto Cavalcanti had already accomplished several feats in his brief, troubled, and memorable stint in the Brazilian film industry. After decades of work in Europe, yielding an output that earned him the international reputation as the most renowned Brazilian filmmaker at the time, Cavalcanti returned to his native country in September 1949 to lecture at the Cinema Seminar promoted by the SÃ£o Paulo Museum of Modern Art (MASP).1 Shortly thereafter, he was hired to work as general producer at the newly founded Vera Cruz Motion Picture Company, created by a group of Italian businessmen and funded by industrialist Francisco âCiccilloâ Matarazzo Sobrinho and engineer Franco Zampari, a top-ranking employee at Matarazzo Industries, who assumed the role of CEO in the new company.Â

Cavalcanti would become involved with the production of the first run of Vera Cruz films: the features CaiÃ§ara (Celi, 1950), Terra Ã© sempre terra (Payne, 1951), and Ãngela (de Almeida & Payne, 1951); and the documentary shorts Painel (1950) and SantuÃ¡rio (1951), directed by Lima Barreto. Prior to his work in these productions, he devoted himself to hiring technicians from Europe and managing the purchase of equipment and the construction of sets â albeit not always in consonance with Zampari. The disagreements between the two resulted in Cavalcanti's departure in early 1951 during theÂ filming of Angela, just over a year after he was hired.Â

Still in the first half of 1951, after an invitation from President GetÃºlio Vargas, he took part in the project for the INC (Instituto Nacional de Cinema), which never came to fruition. The following year he directed his first film in Brazil, the comedy SimÃ£o, o caolho â produced by CinematogrÃ¡fica Maristela and starring the brilliant comedian Mesquitinha â he acted as producer for the documentary short Volta Redonda (Waterhouse, 1952); and published the book Filme e Realidade, which compiled the aforementioned lectures at MASP. In 1952, Cavalcanti served as one of the founding members of Kino Filmes, which despite its short-lived existence resulted in the production of two feature films under his direction in Brazil: O canto do mar (1953) and Mulher de Verdade (1954), which would only debut in 1955, after Cavalcanti had returned to Europe in May of 1954.Â

Following his arrival in Brazil, Cavalcanti attracted immense interest from the national press as much as the film industry. Newspapers never failed to publicize his actions and provide ample opportunities for both defenders and detractors to express their diverse, yet always passionate opinions about the world-famous Brazilian filmmaker. Things were no different in Recife. Cavalcanti's presence in the city stirred up the cultural milieu and provided fuel for the local film critic scene, especially active at the time with several collaborators writing about cinema in the cityâs five daily newspapers. Cavalcantiâs arrival in Recife was met with great expectation concerning the production of a feature film in the city and what this event could represent ten years after the musical Coelho sai (1942), the first sound feature produced in the state of Pernambuco. As the first news emerged about the release of O canto do mar, newspapers published numerous press releases and news stories as well as an impressive number of criticisms, controversies, qualms, defenses, and accusations surrounding the film and its director.2

Cavalcantiâs ties with the Northeast can be traced along his family roots. His father was originally from the state of Alagoas and his mother, Anna Olinda do Rego Rangel Cavalcanti, belonged to a traditional family in the state of Pernambuco. O canto do mar, an adaptation of En rade â a French film directed by Cavalcanti in 1927 â to Brazilâs northeastern coast was a personal project of the filmmaker and listed among Vera Cruzâs future productions in documents dating back to 1950. Cavalcanti once again mentioned the project the following year during his visit to Recife, where he declared his plans to film O cÃ¢ntico do mar [sic] and Menino de engenho, an adaptation of JosÃ© Lins do Regoâs regionalist novel. The production, however, would only come to fruition in 1952 through Kino Filmes. In August, while in Recife, Cavalcanti harnessed his prestige and experience as a producer to successfully establish an official institutional support network â starting with the State Government â which enabled him to organize the filmâs production, including accommodations for the crew, an airplane for filming in the arid hinterlands of the sertÃ£o, and support from the Documentation and Culture Department for systematizing the several forms of local cultural artifacts and expressions that appear throughout the film.

The filming process began in October, after the arrival of technicians and equipment from SÃ£o Paulo, but it was not until December that they were able to shoot with the cast, comprised entirely of local artists, most of whom with prior experience only in theater and radio. By June 1953, filming was concluded after a series of hindrances caused by, among other reasons, the lack of negatives and delays in the arrival of sound recording equipment. The film premiered on October 3, 1953 at a midnight screening hosted by the luxurious Cine SÃ£o Luiz, inaugurated in the previous year.Â

Ten years later, in a chapter dedicated to âCavalcanti and Vera Cruzâ in the book RevisÃ£o crÃ­tica do cinema brasileiro, Glauber Rocha described O canto do mar as an âinconsistent, wavering film, yet nonetheless marked by a vision that defined Cavalcanti's stance towards Brazilâ.3 We find it hard to disagree with Glauber. Nevertheless, in addition to inconsistencies and other limitations raised by Glauber in the chapter (âan overtly academic dramatizationâ, mesmerized by the exotic), one also finds in O canto do mar conspicuous similarities with Brazilian films produced in the following years, including Glauber's own Barravento (1962). Furthermore, the film also reveals several overlaps with Cavalcantiâs previous production and European cinema in general.Â

Inspired by the plot of En rade, which is set in the port of Marseille, O canto do mar promptly reminds us of Cavalcanti's French period (roughly 1915-1933), a formative and investigative period for the filmmaker, who worked first as a set designer before his time directing. His gaze upon the urban everyday life and the cityâs most vulnerable residents is prominent in what has remained Cavalcantiâs best-known French film, Rien que les heures (1926), often placed within the lineage of cinematic urban symphonies. This film explores an interweaving between fiction and documentary which is also present in O canto do mar.

In fact, one of the most common criticisms directed at O canto do mar objects to the poor synergy between the filmâs fictional scenes and its conspicuous documentary moments, connected through a vague and not always harmonious concept. The film begins with a documentary prologue, in which an offscreen narrator presents the misery of the arid hinterland, without rain and lacking humane living conditions. We then see sertanejos4 abandoning their homes and travelling on a flatbed truck to Recife, where they set sail to the south in the hopes of finding work. Upon arriving in Recife, the driver stops the truck on the oceanfront and runs off for a swim, while the peasants marvel at the sea. From that moment the film turns to its narrative, focused on the quotidian drama of a family that lives in one of the beachside huts: the protagonist Raimundo (Rui Saraiva); his mother Maria (Margarida Cardoso), who works as a laundress; his sister Ponina (Cacilda Lanuza) and younger brother. The migrant peasants and the narrator's voiceover will reemerge later, when the former board the ship ready to sail south. In addition to the truck driver, who remains a character in the story, the prologue relates to the plot through the theme of displacement, driven by poverty and lack of prospects. Traveling south and starting a new life is the dream of Raimundo, who plans to run away with his girlfriend Aurora (Aurora Duarte).

Handling veritÃ© moments with great skill and beauty, Cavalcanti films some of the regionâs signature popular cultural expressions: frevo, a dance and musical style characteristic of the carnaval in Recife; the bumba-meu-boi, a theatrical dance celebration that acts out the death and resurrection of an ox; the XangÃ´ de Pernambuco, an Afro-Brazilian religious cult specific to that state. Cavalcanti's talent and expertise in documentary filmmaking truly shine in these moments, revealing why he became one of the leading figures of the British documentary movement in the 1930s. Hired by John Grierson to join the GPO Film Unit, a branch of the UK General Post Office where he remained between 1934 and 1939, Cavalcanti worked on dozens of these productions as a sound technician, screenwriter, editor, director, and producer.Â

â

âO canto do mar bears witness to extraordinary local songs and chants, the preoccupation with the recording and documentation of which can be seen as begun with Cavalcantiâs work for the GPO. During the xangÃ´ scene, when Raimundo takes his deranged father to cure himself with a pai-de-santo, the fictional action is interspersed with the beat of drums and images of rituals in which worshippers dance and enter a trance. The images and sounds throughout this sequence, wholly unusual in commercial Brazilian cinema at the time, may be seen as vigorous precursors of what Cinema Novo would accomplish years later, among which in Glauber Rochaâs debut feature, Barravento (1962), where the universe of CandomblÃ© in Bahia is intrinsic to the filmâs narrative.

With images of the arid hinterlands of the sertÃ£o, the prologue calls to mind another Cinema Novo production, Vidas secas (1963), albeit through differences and ruptures. Cavalcanti incorporates a series of procedures in his rendition of the sertÃ£o which Nelson Pereira dos Santos would categorically reject, such as the use of filters and light reflectors to tame the harsh sunlight, the use of extradiegetic music and the expository and solemn narration.

The frevo sequence in O canto do mar is particularly exhilarating. Shot outdoors among coconut trees on the beach, the scene shows a group of people dancing to the sound of a small brass orchestra. With an impeccable rhythm, the montage alternates general shots of the crowd and orchestra with close-up images of the dancersâ feet and parasols, a typical frevo adornment. Despite being professional dancers, the performers wear everyday clothes and many of them are barefoot, while holding parasols of varying sizes and patterns. At that time, frevo was commonly used in chanchada musical numbers, albeit filmed in a studio setting with a more stylized treatment. While Cavalcantiâs images are also markedly stylized, the visual style of the dancers and the conception of the frevo scene in O canto do mar is fresher, heavily reminiscent of Pierre Vergerâs photographs from 1947 capturing the street carnaval celebrations in Recife.

Cavalcantiâs documentary work in O canto do mar relates to other productions of the period, equally driven by the desire to embrace the richness of popular cultural manifestations, among which is the documentary Bumba-meu-boi: o Bicho Misterioso dos Afogados (1953), filmed in Recife by the Frenchman Romain Lesage and produced by the Joaquim Nabuco Institute. We may also draw a connection with the work of the Folklore Research Mission, founded by writer MÃ¡rio de Andrade (of MacunaÃ­ma fame) during his travels among Brazilâs North and Northeast in 1938, which resulted in over 30 hours of recorded music, more than 600 photographs, and 15 films.5 O canto do mar, however, being a commercial fiction feature film and screened in movie theaters, allowed for a much broader circulation of these precious visual and sound recordings of popular cultural expressions in Pernambuco. Today, these filmic records comprise an undeniable historical document.

In addition to the documentary dimension, popular culture also acquires phantasmagoric contouring in O canto do mar. During Raimundoâs nightmare, which precedes the filmâs ending, Cavalcanti infuses the images and sound of the maracatu with a dreamlike tone. The documentary vein continues in the exuberant maracatu parade, during which we see the imposing figure of Dona Santa, to this day the most widely known queen of maracatu, as well as other emblematic figures and characters of Pernambuco culture and carnaval, such as the spearmen of the maracatu de baque solto and the caboclinhos. These traditional elements, however, assume a spectral nature as the beat of the drums is incorporated into the trance-like atmosphere, during which the protagonistâs subjectivity merges with collective rituals; Dona Santa transforms into Maria, Raimundoâs mother, and Aurora participates in the maracatu procession.6

These documentary imprints traverse the entire film, constantly attentive to the sounds and images of human and geographic landscapes: the anonymous faces of fishermen and prostitutes, the geometry of rooftops in the neighborhood of SÃ£o JosÃ©, the street musicians, the constant presence of the sea breeze in Recife, swaying clothes, hair, and curtains. Hence, it may be more coherent, and much more inspiring, to embrace film critic Ruy Gardnierâs suggestion and contemplate, among the various Alberto Cavalcantis, the âAnthropologist Cavalcantiâ. According to the film critic, âmuch more than a documentarist, his desire to enter a place and from there extract a rhythm to cinema, an impression, an atmosphere, makes Alberto Cavalcanti one of the rare anthropological travelers in the history of cinemaâ.7

Here, Cavalcanti makes the most of the location shots, unlike his prior experience in his first work for Vera Cruz, CaiÃ§ara, in which the geographical and human landscape of Ilha Bela, on the SÃ£o Paulo coastline, mostly serves as a backdrop for the drama of the protagonists.8 Furthermore, by opting to work with local artists (who dubbed their own lines), the film propagated Northeastern faces and accents largely unknown to the general audience in the rest of the country. On the other hand, O canto do mar does bear marked similarities to the initial Vera Cruz productions, especially CaiÃ§ara: a stagnated atmosphere (the image of the whirlpool is common to both films) and a morbid mood permeates both stories, especially as reflected (though not exclusively) in the long scenes showing the childrenâs burial; the contained expression of the inexperienced actors in the main roles (Eliane Lage in the Vera Cruz film; Rui Saraiva in O canto do mar); the âovertly academic dramatizationâ, as defined by Glauber Rocha, which ultimately stifles both the narrative flow as well as the actorsâ performances.

âO canto do mar also bears its fair share of connections with European art cinema, which Cavalcanti had been involved with since the 1920s. There is an undeniable dialogue with Italian neorealism, especially La terra trema (1948), Luchino Viscontiâs film set in a fishing village in Sicily, in which non-actors speak in a local dialect. As in Visconti's film, O canto do mar also transpires against the backdrop of a fishing community, even though the main characters are not directly involved in this activity. In both films, miserable living and work conditions, as well as the lack of prospects for any foreseeable change, ultimately cause the family group to dissolve. Cavalcanti also returns to visual motifs from La terra trema, such as the dark silhouette of women on the beach rocks, waiting for men who may have died at sea; and the personal chest that holds otherworldly possibilities â in Visconti's film, the protagonist uses it to store clothes and postcards from his military days; in O canto do mar, Raimundo stores travel pamphlets and the ship ticket he bought for his southbound travel.

Both films make use of an offscreen narrator. While O canto do mar restricts its use to the documentary scenes with the rural migrants, in La terra trema narration serves as a constant resource, commenting as well as explicating the plot, thus assisting the Italian audience in understanding the regional dialect spoken in the film. However, the two films have vastly different approaches to the socioeconomic issue. In La terra trema, poverty and family dissolution result from economic exploitation, which reigns over the working conditions of fishermen, a mechanism that the film exposes and reiterates. In turn, while O canto do mar expresses a âsocial sensibilityâ, which Cavalcanti believed every film should have,9 the vision is somewhat diffuse. Misery exists and is shown on screen, but lacking exploration of structural elements that would allow us to see beyond mere observation.Â

â

This social sensibility takes on a more vigorous and poignant dimension when translated into visual composition. In these moments we find the plastic and poetic ingenuity Cavalcanti exhibited as a set designer and director in his silent work. The filmâs opening image, after the initial credits, is an admirable fusion between the map of the Northeast, with the state of Pernambuco in the center, and an image of the cracked soil in the arid hinterlands of the sertÃ£o. The similar geometric figures formed by the lines and cracks plastically introduce the drought of the sertÃ£o, serving as a visual metaphor of imprisonment, which will reemerge in different visual formations (whirlpools, grids, cages) throughout the film.Â

Two particular visual compositions could be placed in dialogue with one of the most dazzling films from the silent era, Der mÃ¼de Tod (1921), directed by Fritz Lang. When filming Ponina, Raimundoâs sister, climbing the stairs of a brothel, Cavalcanti frames an exquisitely beautiful shot, reminiscent of the moment when the protagonist in the German film enters the realm of death. In O canto do mar, the long staircases, commonly seen in the bungalows of Recife, signal Poninaâs passage between the two worlds as she opts for sex work to escape family poverty.

In the elaborate sequence depicting the death of Raimundoâs brother, Cavalcanti composes a detailed choreography of gestures and lights from oil lamps, which the neighbors carry to light the way to the family hut where the child is being prepared for burial. The sequence begins with tears flowing from Poninaâs face, as she breaks the news to Raimundo, overlapping and merging with the images of lamps carried by the neighbors walking in the dead of night. Inside the house, each person arriving gives a lamp to a family member, who places them on the furniture and shelves. The candle-lit environment surrounding the childâs body resembles the room full of candles in Der mÃ¼de Tod, in which each candle symbolizes a human life. While extinguishing one of the flames, Death carries in its arms a child who recently passed away.

Cavalcanti reinvents Langâs visual metaphor from elements belonging to the secular and religious world of the Brazilian Northeast, visually translating the vulnerability of those lives, both in the sertÃ£o and on the coast, in fiction and reality.

When he arrived in the city of Recife, Brazil, in 1952 to shoot O canto do mar, filmmaker Alberto Cavalcanti had already accomplished several feats in his brief, troubled, and memorable stint in the Brazilian film industry.

Prior to his work in these productions, he devoted himself to hiring technicians from Europe and managing the purchase of equipment and the construction of sets â albeit not always in consonance with Zampari.

In turn, while O canto do mar expresses a âsocial sensibilityâ, which Cavalcanti believed every film should have,9 the vision is somewhat diffuse. Misery exists and is shown on screen, but lacking exploration of structural elements that would allow us to see beyond mere observation.Â

â

This social sensibility takes on a more vigorous and poignant dimension when translated into visual composition. In these moments we find the plastic and poetic ingenuity Cavalcanti exhibited as a set designer and director in his silent work. The filmâs opening image, after the initial credits, is an admirable fusion between the map of the Northeast, with the state of Pernambuco in the center, and an image of the cracked soil in the arid hinterlands of the sertÃ£o. The similar geometric figures formed by the lines and cracks plastically introduce the drought of the sertÃ£o, serving as a visual metaphor of imprisonment, which will reemerge in different visual formations (whirlpools, grids, cages) throughout the film.Â

Two particular visual compositions could be placed in dialogue with one of the most dazzling films from the silent era, Der mÃ¼de Tod (1921), directed by Fritz Lang. When filming Ponina, Raimundoâs sister, climbing the stairs of a brothel, Cavalcanti frames an exquisitely beautiful shot, reminiscent of the moment when the protagonist in the German film enters the realm of death. In O canto do mar, the long staircases, commonly seen in the bungalows of Recife, signal Poninaâs passage between the two worlds as she opts for sex work to escape family poverty.

In the elaborate sequence depicting the death of Raimundoâs brother, Cavalcanti composes a detailed choreography of gestures and lights from oil lamps, which the neighbors carry to light the way to the family hut where the child is being prepared for burial. The sequence begins with tears flowing from Poninaâs face, as she breaks the news to Raimundo, overlapping and merging with the images of lamps carried by the neighbors walking in the dead of night. Inside the house, each person arriving gives a lamp to a family member, who places them on the furniture and shelves. The candle-lit environment surrounding the childâs body resembles the room full of candles in Der mÃ¼de Tod, in which each candle symbolizes a human life. While extinguishing one of the flames, Death carries in its arms a child who recently passed away.

Cavalcanti reinvents Langâs visual metaphor from elements belonging to the secular and religious world of the Brazilian Northeast, visually translating the vulnerability of those lives, both in the sertÃ£o and on the coast, in fiction and reality.

IntroduÃ§Ã£o

Minha inserÃ§Ã£o profissional em preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual coincide com o inÃ­cio da utilizaÃ§Ã£o das ferramentas digitais na Ã¡rea de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes no Brasil. A experiÃªncia prÃ¡tica nos arquivos audiovisuais e em restauraÃ§Ã£o, iniciada justamente no perÃ­odo de transiÃ§Ã£o para o digital, em 2000, permitiu um olhar a partir de uma perspectiva privilegiada, ao possibilitar acompanhar de perto, na lida cotidiana, a transformaÃ§Ã£o da Ã¡rea. O desejo de investigar essas experiÃªncias, sistematizÃ¡-las e transformÃ¡-las em objeto de estudo, a fim de tentar contribuir para a reflexÃ£o sobre o campo no Brasil, desembocou na minha pesquisa de doutorado iniciada na Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo em 2016. A pesquisa foi finalizada em dezembro de 2020,1 e o foco foi a restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes no Brasil e a incorporaÃ§Ã£o da tecnologia digital no sÃ©culo XXI, realizada na Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. Esta investigaÃ§Ã£o incorpora uma dupla dimensÃ£o: por um lado, minha experiÃªncia profissional e, por outro, o interesse em refletir sobre esses processos sob uma perspectiva histÃ³rica, incluindo os aspectos tÃ©cnicos, estÃ©ticos e Ã©ticos da restauraÃ§Ã£o de obras brasileiras. Um pequeno recorte deste trabalho serÃ¡ abordado nesse artigo, onde apresentarei, em linhas gerais, um olhar histÃ³rico sobre a restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes no Brasil, um breve panorama da trajetÃ³ria do campo da restauraÃ§Ã£o digital desde o ano 2000 e alguns marcos histÃ³ricos desde seus primÃ³rdios.

A ImportÃ¢ncia do Ano 2000

Nas Ãºltimas duas dÃ©cadas, o campo da preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual passou por profundas transformaÃ§Ãµes. Uma das evidÃªncias dessa transformaÃ§Ã£o pode ser encontrada na crescente quantidade de pesquisas conduzidas sobre o tema da preservaÃ§Ã£o de filmes e seus diversos aspectos. A incorporaÃ§Ã£o da tecnologia digital no processo de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes permitiu que o campo ganhasse mais destaque tanto em termos de habilidades prÃ¡ticas quanto como disciplina acadÃªmica. Como resultado, os estudiosos tentaram defini-lo teoricamente por meio de uma anÃ¡lise mais profunda de seus muitos complexos elementos. A bibliografia internacional tambÃ©m cresceu consideravelmente desde os anos 2000, incluindo bem-vindas contribuiÃ§Ãµes de pesquisadores e estudiosos brasileiros. Embora pesquisas aprofundadas sobre restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes ainda nÃ£o sejam muito comuns no Brasil, o surgimento de trabalhos recentes com destaque sobre o tema e questÃµes relacionadas prova que hÃ¡ interesse no assunto e na preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual como disciplina acadÃªmica.

â

Do final dos anos 1990 atÃ© meados dos anos 2000, as ferramentas digitais de restauraÃ§Ã£o foram introduzidas e disseminadas entre os principais arquivos de filmes, com o apoio financeiro de grandes companhias produtoras.2 No inÃ­cio, devido aos custos proibitivos para a maioria das instituiÃ§Ãµes e arquivos, essas ferramentas eram utilizadas apenas ocasionalmente. No entanto, os avanÃ§os tecnolÃ³gicos permitiram que se tornassem mais acessÃ­veis para projetos nÃ£o comerciais e mais amplamente adotadas no processo de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filme ao longo da primeira dÃ©cada de 2000.

â

A tecnologia digital foi incorporada ao fluxo de trabalho de restauraÃ§Ã£o no Brasil no inÃ­cio do sÃ©culo XXI, a exemplo do que acontecia em alguns paÃ­ses da Europa e nos Estados Unidos. AtÃ© aquele momento, cada etapa do processo de restauraÃ§Ã£o era fotoquÃ­mica. Os restauradores de filmes utilizavam equipamentos analÃ³gicos que haviam sido usados por anos em laboratÃ³rios cinematogrÃ¡ficos comerciais e a equipe tÃ©cnica da maioria dos projetos de restauraÃ§Ã£o foi treinada, principalmente, enquanto trabalhava para esses laboratÃ³rios. Com o advento das ferramentas digitais, as intervenÃ§Ãµes no processo de restauraÃ§Ã£o passaram a ser realizadas por computadores e profissionais com novas competÃªncias. Esses novos restauradores tinham conhecimento dos softwares de restauraÃ§Ã£o digital e da tecnologia computacional, experiÃªncias profissionais diferentes dos tÃ©cnicos que haviam trabalhado apenas em laboratÃ³rios de cinema. Antes de elaborar uma anÃ¡lise mais aprofundada do campo da restauraÃ§Ã£o digital no Brasil, Ã© necessÃ¡rio, primeiramente, apresentar um panorama histÃ³rico resumido dos laboratÃ³rios cinematogrÃ¡ficos brasileiros.

Nas primeiras dÃ©cadas da realizaÃ§Ã£o cinematogrÃ¡fica no paÃ­s, a maior parte das pequenas companhias produtoras possuÃ­am seus prÃ³prios laboratÃ³rios, valendo-se, provavelmente, de instrumental semelhante ao que era utilizado para a revelaÃ§Ã£o fotogrÃ¡fica de imagens fixas, sendo a prÃ³pria cÃ¢mera de filmar o copiador, caracterÃ­stica presente nos modelos da Ã©poca. Na cadeia de processamento de material fotoquÃ­mico, o primeiro passo Ã© a revelaÃ§Ã£o do material negativo para entÃ£o sua posterior copiagem para o material positivo, isto Ã©, as cÃ³pias de projeÃ§Ã£o. SerÃ¡ na dÃ©cada de 1910 que o laboratÃ³rio da Botelho Film, de Alberto Botelho, consegue dar os primeiros passos rumo Ã alguma padronizaÃ§Ã£o dos procedimentos realizados, obtendo resultados acima da mÃ©dia e, por conseguinte, a confecÃ§Ã£o de cÃ³pias melhores atÃ© entÃ£o produzidas no Brasil. Localizamos referÃªncias sobre alguns outros laboratÃ³rios do perÃ­odo. Por exemplo, companhias como a IndependÃªncia Film, de JosÃ© e Victor del Picchia, e a Benedetti Film, de Paulo Benedetti, possuÃ­am laboratÃ³rios, onde teria sido realizado o processamento de tÃ­tulos como Braza dormida (Mauro, 1928), Barro humano (Gonzaga, 1929) e Limite (Peixoto, 1931). Um marco importante acontecerÃ¡ prÃ³ximo ao final da dÃ©cada de 1920, com a chegada dos fotÃ³grafos e laboratoristas hÃºngaros Adalberto Kemeny e Rudolf Lustig,3 que compram o laboratÃ³rio da IndependÃªncia Film e o transformam nos LaboratÃ³rios Rex, que funcionarÃ¡ atÃ© a dÃ©cada de 1970. Os conhecimentos tÃ©cnicos dos imigrantes hÃºngaros permitiram um maior controle dos parÃ¢metros necessÃ¡rios para o melhor processamento dos materiais, como o controle da temperatura e do tempo, sendo responsÃ¡veis por melhorias na qualidade tÃ©cnica dos materiais brasileiros.Â

A passagem para o cinema sonoro nos anos 1930 vai tornar o processamento laboratorial ainda mais complexo e irÃ¡ provocar o progressivo fechamento dos laboratÃ³rios de pequeno porte oriundos do perÃ­odo silencioso. Na contramÃ£o dessa tendÃªncia, a companhia produtora CinÃ©dia, fundada em 1930 por Adhemar Gonzaga, irÃ¡ constituir seu prÃ³prio laboratÃ³rio ainda nessa dÃ©cada.

O laboratÃ³rio da CinÃ©dia funcionou com muitos contratempos atÃ© ao final da dÃ©cada de 1940, perÃ­odo particularmente difÃ­cil para a empresa. O contexto da Segunda Guerra Mundial apenas agravou as dificuldades da CinÃ©dia, chegando mesmo a fazer com que encerrasse momentaneamente as suas operaÃ§Ãµes no final de 1941. Em marÃ§o de 1942, os estÃºdios da CinÃ©dia reabriram para as filmagens de Ã tudo verdade, de Orson Welles, mas sÃ³ retomaram totalmente as produÃ§Ãµes no ano seguinte. Os efeitos desastrosos causados pela guerra, como a falta de estoque de filme virgem e produtos quÃ­micos para o seu processamento, foram sentidos pela CinÃ©dia ao longo da dÃ©cada. O impacto da guerra, entre outros fatores, culminou com o seu desmantelamento em 1949, quando Adhemar Gonzaga decidiu se desfazer dos equipamentos cinematogrÃ¡ficos do laboratÃ³rio. Em 1951, Gonzaga interrompeu as atividades da CinÃ©dia e alienou parte do terreno dos estÃºdios para liquidar todos os compromissos financeiros da empresa. O laboratÃ³rio foi posteriormente desmontado e sua produÃ§Ã£o foi definitivamente interrompida.

â

Outro marco importante para o restauro de filmes no Brasil foi a criaÃ§Ã£o do Ãºnico laboratÃ³rio de restauraÃ§Ã£o existente em um arquivo audiovisual brasileiro: o da Cinemateca Brasileira. Criado em 1976 a partir de aquisiÃ§Ã£o de equipamentos e peÃ§as descartadas pela entÃ£o chamada LÃ­der CinelaboratÃ³rios,4 empresa carioca que havia recÃ©m adquirido os laboratÃ³rios Rex com a finalidade de expandir seus negÃ³cios para SÃ£o Paulo. A aquisiÃ§Ã£o se iniciou apÃ³s convencÃª-los de que a Cinemateca nÃ£o se constituiria como concorrente de mercado, o que nÃ£o seria mesmo possÃ­vel, visto o carÃ¡ter cultural da instituiÃ§Ã£o. A partir daÃ­, uma parceria informal se estabelece, e a empresa passa a comunicar a Cinemateca periodicamente quando do descarte de algum equipamento antigo.Â

â

Carlos Augusto Calil, responsÃ¡vel pelo Departamento de PreservaÃ§Ã£o da Cinemateca Brasileira Ã Ã©poca, foi quem esteve Ã frente desse processo. Seu senso de oportunidade foi essencial para que a empreitada fosse bem-sucedida, jÃ¡ que teve a perspicÃ¡cia de perceber e tirar proveito de um momento singular â ou seja, o momento de descarte do maquinÃ¡rio antigo dos laboratÃ³rios Rex por conta da modernizaÃ§Ã£o tecnolÃ³gica empreendida pelos novos donos â para adquirir a infraestrutura bÃ¡sica necessÃ¡ria, e, o mais importante, a preÃ§os acessÃ­veis, para a implementaÃ§Ã£o de um laboratÃ³rio na instituiÃ§Ã£o.

â

Durante o perÃ­odo de implementaÃ§Ã£o do laboratÃ³rio na Cinemateca Brasileira, Calil teve a oportunidade de realizar o II Curso de VerÃ£o organizado pela FIAF (FederaÃ§Ã£o Internacional de Arquivos de Filme) no Staatlichesfilmarchiv (Arquivo de Filmes da RepÃºblica DemocrÃ¡tica AlemÃ£). O curso abordou, sobretudo, questÃµes relacionadas Ã conservaÃ§Ã£o e restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes e acabou sendo muito importante para os profissionais brasileiros. Ao longo do curso, Calil teve acesso a publicaÃ§Ãµes sobre documentaÃ§Ã£o e catalogaÃ§Ã£o de filmes ainda nÃ£o publicadas no Brasil, materiais que ele compartilharia com os tÃ©cnicos da Cinemateca Brasileira. Isso garantiu que o conhecimento dos mÃ©todos de preservaÃ§Ã£o de filmes em uso em instituiÃ§Ãµes estrangeiras fosse compartilhado e aplicado pelos profissionais brasileiros em seus prÃ³prios trabalhos. No entanto, uma das principais liÃ§Ãµes que Calil aprendeu foi que a soluÃ§Ã£o para os problemas de preservaÃ§Ã£o dos filmes brasileiros teria que ser inventada e desenvolvida por brasileiros. Essa conclusÃ£o se deve ao que hoje Ã© uma histÃ³ria bem conhecida na comunidade de preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual brasileira. Calil conta que Hans KarnstÃ¤dt, responsÃ¡vel pelo laboratÃ³rio de conservaÃ§Ã£o e restauraÃ§Ã£o de Staatlichesfilmarchiv, foi questionado sobre o tratamento adequado para filmes de nitrato melados. KarnstÃ¤dt ficou surpreso com a pergunta e respondeu que nunca havia visto nenhum material em tais condiÃ§Ãµes. Algumas razÃµes para tal fato podem ser apontadas: como a Alemanha tem um clima frio e suas instituiÃ§Ãµes culturais sÃ£o financeiramente estÃ¡veis ââ(permitindo a manutenÃ§Ã£o dos nÃ­veis adequados de temperatura e umidade dos depÃ³sitos), eles nunca tiveram que se preocupar com cenÃ¡rios em que grande parte de suas coleÃ§Ãµes encontram-se em estÃ¡gios avanÃ§ados de degradaÃ§Ã£o. Mas no Brasil, devido ao clima quente e a instabilidade crÃ´nica da Ã¡rea, filmes de nitrato e acetato melados eram (e ainda sÃ£o) uma ocorrÃªncia muito mais comum. Embora essa situaÃ§Ã£o tenha acontecido hÃ¡ quatro dÃ©cadas, os problemas enfrentados pelos arquivos e profissionais brasileiros nÃ£o mudaram substancialmente. As condiÃ§Ãµes de conservaÃ§Ã£o da maior parte do patrimÃ´nio audiovisual do paÃ­s apresentam problemas especÃ­ficos que somente a experiÃªncia de trabalho no Brasil local pode resolver.

A RestauraÃ§Ã£o Digital de Filmes no Brasil: O Nascimento e a RÃ¡pida DecadÃªncia de um Campo

Mas serÃ¡ efetivamente no final de maio de 1977 que o LaboratÃ³rio de RestauraÃ§Ã£o da Cinemateca Brasileira passarÃ¡ a operar realizando atividades de copiagem e revelaÃ§Ã£o. Uma das figuras centrais para tal fato serÃ¡ JoÃ£o SÃ³crates de Oliveira,5 arquiteto de formaÃ§Ã£o que entra na instituiÃ§Ã£o sem ter tido experiÃªncia prÃ©via na Ã¡rea de cinema e se tornarÃ¡ um restaurador de filmes de renome internacional.

â

Entre as dÃ©cadas de 1970 e 2000, as restauraÃ§Ãµes de filmes no Brasil foram capitaneadas, sobretudo, pelos arquivos audiovisuais, e realizadas em parceria com laboratÃ³rios comerciais ou pelo laboratÃ³rio da Cinemateca Brasileira. A chegada da primeira dÃ©cada de 2000 representou o crescimento dos aportes pÃºblicos em preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual e o inÃ­cio da realizaÃ§Ã£o um significativo nÃºmero de projetos de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes brasileiros. Nesse perÃ­odo, se destacaram o restauro de tÃ­tulos de diretores integrantes do Cinema Novo, atravÃ©s de projetos liderados por suas herdeiras. Alguns poucos anos depois, em 2007 e 2009, a Petrobras investirÃ¡ em dois editais pÃºblicos de restauro coordenados pela Cinemateca Brasileira, atestando que, ainda que momentaneamente, um papel mais ativo do Estado no fomento da atividade.SerÃ¡ na virada do milÃªnio, mais exatamente em 1996, que serÃ¡ utilizada pela primeira vez no Brasil a tecnologia digital durante o processo de restauro de um filme. Foi em O Ã©brio (Abreu, 1946), uma produÃ§Ã£o da CinÃ©dia. Apesar de ter tido a imagem restaurada fotoquimicamente, se utilizou de um procedimento hÃ­brido para o som, mesclando etapas fotoquÃ­micas e digitais. O relanÃ§amento de O Ã©brio estava sendo pensado desde meados dos anos 1990, por conta do aniversÃ¡rio de cinquenta anos da primeira exibiÃ§Ã£o do filme em 1996. Em marÃ§o daquele ano, a CinÃ©dia propÃµe a Riofilme6,um projeto de restauraÃ§Ã£o do que teria sido a versÃ£o original da obra, incluÃ­do seu relanÃ§amento comercial ao final do processo. Uma das prioridades era o retorno do filme aos cinemas, talvez por conta disso o projeto tenha sido apresentado Ã uma distribuidora. Nesse sentido, ele parece ter fomentado possibilidades de atuaÃ§Ã£o que inclusive tiveram outros frutos, visto que em 2002 Ã© levado a cabo, tambÃ©m pela Riofilme, a reformataÃ§Ã£o digital e o relanÃ§amento de outro tÃ­tulo do passado, Deus e diabo na terra do sol (Rocha, 1964).

â

Mas serÃ¡ em 2003 que terÃ¡ inÃ­cio um projeto que efetivamente pode ser considerado um marco para a restauraÃ§Ã£o digital de filmes no Brasil: o restauro da obra completa de Joaquim Pedro de Andrade, idealizado pelos filhos do cineasta, Alice, Maria e Antonio de Andrade, iniciativa pioneira na utilizaÃ§Ã£o da tecnologia digital de 2K de resoluÃ§Ã£o no paÃ­s. Nesse momento, na Ã¡rea audiovisual, esse tipo de tecnologia era utilizado, sobretudo, para as etapas de intermediaÃ§Ã£o digital realizadas durante o processo de finalizaÃ§Ã£o de um filme. Ã a primeira vez, portanto, que um projeto de restauraÃ§Ã£o brasileiro emprega essa ferramenta, o que representou um marco decisivo para o desenvolvimento do campo no paÃ­s, tendo sido um dos fatores responsÃ¡veis pela atualizaÃ§Ã£o tecnolÃ³gica do LaboratÃ³rio de RestauraÃ§Ã£o da Cinemateca Brasileira, alÃ©m de propiciar a criaÃ§Ã£o de um NÃºcleo de RestauraÃ§Ã£o na empresa de pÃ³s-produÃ§Ã£o audiovisual Teleimage, em SÃ£o Paulo.

O pioneirismo e a envergadura do projeto (restaurar digitalmente a obra completa de um cineasta) fez com que a metodologia de trabalho, as escolhas tÃ©cnicas e Ã©ticas fossem descobertas e aperfeiÃ§oadas ao longo do processo. Como ainda era um campo emergente, a necessidade de os profissionais envolvidos ganharem experiÃªncia com ferramentas de restauraÃ§Ã£o digital era essencial. Afinal, a realizaÃ§Ã£o de um projeto de restauro em 2K no Brasil era novidade para todos os envolvidos, o que representou um grande desafio. SerÃ¡ neste perÃ­odo, justamente por conta de projetos como o de Joaquim Pedro, que acontecerÃ¡ a abertura de departamentos dedicados Ã restauraÃ§Ã£o digital de filmes dentro de laboratÃ³rios comerciais de pÃ³s-produÃ§Ã£o, como Ã© o caso dos EstÃºdios Mega e da Teleimage, ambos em SÃ£o Paulo, e da Labocine, no Rio de Janeiro.Â

â

Desde 2000, os EstÃºdios Mega7 vinham investindo em seu parque tecnolÃ³gico, com direcionamento para a aquisiÃ§Ã£o de equipamentos de intermediaÃ§Ã£o digital. Em 2001 foi adquirida uma estaÃ§Ã£o de trabalho chamada Restore, que consistia de um software acompanhado de um computador exclusivo. Esse equipamento, fabricado pela empresa norte-americana Da Vinci Systems, pioneira na produÃ§Ã£o de equipamentos para pÃ³s-produÃ§Ã£o digital, teve um custo de 380 mil dÃ³lares (cerca de 760 mil reais Ã Ã©poca). A estaÃ§Ã£o nÃ£o tinha a capacidade de digitalizar, sendo que os materiais tinham que ser digitalizados previamente em outra mÃ¡quina, como, por exemplo, um telecine. Ainda assim, o custo era bem alto, se mostrando proibitivo para praticamente a totalidade dos arquivos audiovisuais brasileiros nesse momento. Por conta disso, os responsÃ¡veis pela introduÃ§Ã£o dessa tecnologia no Brasil foram as empresas de pÃ³s-produÃ§Ã£o e finalizaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual, que tinham que se adaptar rapidamente Ã s tendÃªncias de mercado, sobretudo ao lucrativo mercado publicitÃ¡rio.Â

â

A Teleimage iniciou seu Departamento de RestauraÃ§Ã£o com o filme PelÃ© eterno (AnÃ­bal Massaini Neto, 2004), para a correÃ§Ã£o digital de parte das imagens de arquivo que integram o documentÃ¡rio, que levou cerca de cinco anos para ser concluÃ­do por conta do volume do trabalho de pesquisa. ApÃ³s esse trabalho, a empresa decidiu expandir o setor com o projeto de restauraÃ§Ã£o digital da obra completa de Joaquim Pedro de Andrade.Â

O caso da Labocine foi um pouco diferente em alguns aspectos. Como os dois exemplos citados, o setor de RestauraÃ§Ã£o tambÃ©m se iniciou a partir dos serviÃ§os de intermediaÃ§Ã£o digital jÃ¡ oferecidos por essas empresas, que se utilizavam da estrutura existente para servir de base para a inclusÃ£o da tecnologia destinada para o restauro digital de filmes. Isto Ã©, softwares especÃ­ficos, computadores com maior capacidade de processamento e servidores com capacidade de armazenamento adequada. Entretanto, ao invÃ©s de renomados cineastas do Cinema Novo, cujos filmes foram realizados a partir da dÃ©cada de 1960, a Labocine decide investir na restauraÃ§Ã£o digital de Bonequinha de seda, obra realizada em 1936 por Oduvaldo Viana. O fato Ã© que o filme foi produzido pela CinÃ©dia, parceira de longa data do laboratÃ³rio, e este talvez tenha sido o motivo principal para que o laboratÃ³rio tenha assumido tal empreitada. AlÃ©m, Ã© claro, da possibilidade de adentrar em um mercado em expansÃ£o e com um diferencial em relaÃ§Ã£o Ã s outras empresas: ter como trabalho inaugural a restauraÃ§Ã£o de um filme realizado na dÃ©cada de 1930, ou seja, hÃ¡ quase 80 anos atrÃ¡s. Mas esse caso modelo levou muito mais tempo que se esperava. A restauraÃ§Ã£o do tÃ­tulo, que contou com uma etapa fotoquÃ­mica e outra digital, se iniciou em 2006 e levou cerca de sete anos para ser concluÃ­da, tanto por conta das interrupÃ§Ãµes provocadas pelas dificuldades tÃ©cnicas encontradas quanto pelo aporte de investimentos efetuados ao longo do processo.8 Diferente dos EstÃºdios Mega e da Teleimage, a Labocine nÃ£o contou com a garantia e o volume de recursos de um projeto de restauraÃ§Ã£o composto por vÃ¡rios tÃ­tulos ou de uma obra completa, como foi com a ColeÃ§Ã£o Glauber Rocha e com o projeto do Joaquim Pedro, mas sim o restauro de um Ãºnico tÃ­tulo, o que fez com que a empresa contasse com um montante de investimentos menor do que suas congÃªneres9 Â O que, por fim, representou menos profissionais exclusivamente dedicados ao projeto, menos equipamentos e, por conseguinte, menor velocidade na execuÃ§Ã£o do trabalho. Apesar dos inÃºmeros desafios enfrentados, o esforÃ§o foi em certa medida recompensado devido Ã inestimÃ¡vel experiÃªncia acumulada pelos tÃ©cnicos ao longo do processo.Â

AlÃ©m disso, uma questÃ£o importante merece ser ressaltada: o restauro de Bonequinha de seda acabou por revelar limitaÃ§Ãµes intrÃ­nsecas das ferramentas digitais em relaÃ§Ã£o a um dos grandes problemas apresentados pelos materiais remanescentes: a profusÃ£o de riscos e abrasÃµes incorporadas fotograficamente Ã imagem (conforme figura abaixo). A resposta diante das primeiras etapas de tratamento do material no software de restauraÃ§Ã£o Diamant, tanto na modalidade automÃ¡tica quanto semiautomÃ¡tica, foi mÃ­nima, visto que a ferramenta nÃ£o conseguia localizar os problemas pois jÃ¡ faziam parte da imagem, revelando uma limitaÃ§Ã£o inerente a estas formas de dano. Tentou-se interferir de maneira mais drÃ¡stica e o resultado foi ainda pior, com a criaÃ§Ã£o de inÃºmeros artefatos e a acentuaÃ§Ã£o de algumas deformaÃ§Ãµes na tentativa de estabilizaÃ§Ã£o geral ou parcial dos quadros.

Ou seja, no geral, a atuaÃ§Ã£o da ferramenta digital nÃ£o trouxe resultados significativos para os problemas considerados mais graves e de maior intensidade. ApÃ³s a exibiÃ§Ã£o de algumas amostras do trabalho e consultas a especialistas em eventos internacionais, comprovou-se que os procedimentos adotados estavam, a princÃ­pio, corretos, e que, infelizmente, a atuaÃ§Ã£o dos softwares de restauraÃ§Ã£o nos danos apresentados pelo filme nÃ£o teria a repercussÃ£o desejada, ao menos nÃ£o na versÃ£o em que se encontravam. Dada a particularidade dos danos, se estabeleceu um canal de comunicaÃ§Ã£o permanente entre o laboratÃ³rio e a empresa desenvolvedora do software, a HS-Art, o que viabilizou aperfeiÃ§oamentos especÃ­ficos para a limpeza dos riscos e arranhÃµes incorporados fotograficamente na imagem.10

O que podemos notar atravÃ©s desse exemplo Ã© que as ferramentas estrangeiras, mesmo as desenvolvidas especificamente para a restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes, como Ã© o caso do software austrÃ­aco Diamant, nÃ£o respondem de forma completamente satisfatÃ³ria, dada a especificidade dos problemas de deterioraÃ§Ã£o apresentados pelos filmes brasileiros, ainda que riscos e outros danos nÃ£o sejam exclusividade de nossos materiais.11 Por conta disso, parcerias com laboratÃ³rios de restauraÃ§Ã£o e fabricantes de softwares sÃ£o importantes, sobretudo para projetos de pequeno porte e com materiais que estejam bastante comprometidos. Neste sentido, a ideia de se investir em um laboratÃ³rio de restauraÃ§Ã£o de um arquivo de filmes (como o da Cinemateca Brasileira) Ã© uma opÃ§Ã£o estratÃ©gica, visto que a Ã³tica de um laboratÃ³rio comercial sempre serÃ¡ direcionada para projetos financeiramente lucrativos.Â

A consolidaÃ§Ã£o da intermediaÃ§Ã£o digital como etapa integrante da produÃ§Ã£o audiovisual em meados da primeira dÃ©cada do sÃ©culo XXI parecia trazer consequÃªncias bastante benÃ©ficas para a Ã¡rea de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes. Com o barateamento desse tipo de serviÃ§o, a tecnologia digital passou a ser adotada amplamente nos procedimentos de restauraÃ§Ã£o e proporcionou o desenvolvimento das ferramentas e da prÃ³pria Ã¡rea. Visto os projetos de restauro realizados desde a virada do milÃªnio, o Brasil aparentava seguir por um caminho de desenvolvimento semelhante ao restante do mundo. No entanto, infelizmente, o campo da restauraÃ§Ã£o digital de filmes no paÃ­s comeÃ§ou a regredir em 2010. Neste ano, por falta de financiamento para projetos de restauro, os departamentos de restauraÃ§Ã£o como o da Mega Studios comeÃ§aram a fechar. O que antes era considerado um mercado em expansÃ£o, com o inÃ­cio do fechamento de Departamentos de RestauraÃ§Ã£o nas empresas de finalizaÃ§Ã£o, logo se tornou um serviÃ§o de nicho.Â Â

A partir de meados de 2010, a ampla adoÃ§Ã£o da tecnologia digital em todas as etapas da cadeira audiovisual â produÃ§Ã£o, distribuiÃ§Ã£o e exibiÃ§Ã£o â fez com que uma grande entrada de recursos nos laboratÃ³rios cinematogrÃ¡ficos brasileiros, oriunda da confecÃ§Ã£o de cÃ³pias em pelÃ­cula de filmes estrangeiros distribuÃ­dos no paÃ­s, cessasse. Funcionava como uma reserva de mercado: era obrigatÃ³rio que os filmes estrangeiros lanÃ§ados nos cinemas brasileiros confeccionassem seus materiais de difusÃ£o em pelÃ­cula no paÃ­s. Apesar de empresas como Labocine, Teleimage e EstÃºdios Mega terem se mostrado parceiras importantes dos projetos de restauro citados, todas eram, afinal, empresas comerciais que visavam lucro. As que possuÃ­am laboratÃ³rios fÃ­lmicos, como a Labocine, reduziram bastante sua margem de lucro com a diminuiÃ§Ã£o e posterior interrupÃ§Ã£o de produÃ§Ã£o de cÃ³pias em pelÃ­cula 35mm ao longo de 2010.Â

â

O volume de investimentos pÃºblicos em restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes (e em preservaÃ§Ã£o audiovisual em geral) reduziu drasticamente a partir de 2011, o que gerou consequÃªncias nefastas para o campo. Uma das primeiras consequÃªncias mais notÃ¡veis aconteceu em 2015, com a extinÃ§Ã£o do NÃºcleo de RestauraÃ§Ã£o da Teleimage e a demissÃ£o da equipe do setor. Para completar o cenÃ¡rio de decadÃªncia, a consolidaÃ§Ã£o da projeÃ§Ã£o digital no circuito exibidor e a reduÃ§Ã£o substancial do volume de processamento de cÃ³pias 35mm, maior fonte de renda da Labocine, inviabilizou a continuidade da empresa a longo prazo, o que culminou com seu fechamento definitivo em marÃ§o de 2015. Desde entÃ£o, a Ã¡rea de restauraÃ§Ã£o de filmes no Brasil retraiu-se vertiginosamente, o que demonstra que apesar dos aportes iniciais realizados pelas empresas privadas, o setor era dependente dos recursos oriundos do Estado e de medidas de proteÃ§Ã£o de mercado. Com exceÃ§Ã£o do LaboratÃ³rio de RestauraÃ§Ã£o da Cinemateca Brasileira, que passou a operar sobretudo para demandas internas desde 2016, mas que estÃ¡ com suas atividades paralisadas desde marÃ§o de 2020,12 e a empresa Afinal Filmes, que passou a oferecer serviÃ§os de restauraÃ§Ã£o digital por volta de 2017, nÃ£o hÃ¡ outras opÃ§Ãµes.Â

â

LaboratÃ³rios CinematogrÃ¡ficos no Brasil

Introduction

My professional entry into the field of film preservation coincided with the emergence of digital restoration in Brazil. I began working within film archives in the year 2000. Being around archives at that time allowed me to witness the impact that digital technology was having on the still nascent field of digital film restoration. It was my desire to investigate my own early experiences as a film preservationist, systematize them, turn them into an object of study, and to contribute to a wider discussion on film restoration, that prompted me to begin doctoral research at the University of SÃ£o Paulo in 2016. I finished this research at the end of 2020,1 focusing my dissertation on film restoration in Brazil and the incorporation of digital restoration technology in the 21st century. The research I conducted had two dimensions: on one hand, it included my professional experiences, and on the other, my interest in considering the historical process of film restoration in Brazil from technical, aesthetic and ethical perspectives. A small excerpt from this work will be addressed in this article, where I will present, in general terms, a historical background of film restoration in Brazil, a brief overview on the trajectory of the digital restoration field since the year 2000 and highlight some historical milestones since its early beginnings.Â

Significance of the Year 2000

Over the last two decades, the field of audiovisual preservation has undergone profound changes. One of the evidences of this transformation can be found in the increasing amount of research being conducted on the topic of film preservation and its various aspects. The incorporation of digital technology within the film restoration process allowed the field to gain more prominence both in terms of practical skills and as an academic discipline. As a result, scholars have attempted to theoretically define it through deeper analysis of its many complex elements. The international bibliography on film preservation has also grown considerably since the 2000s, including welcome contributions from Brazilian researchers and scholars. Although in-depth film restoration research is still not very common in Brazil, the emergence of recent prominent writings on this topic and related issues proves that there is serious interest in the topic and in audiovisual preservation as an academic discipline.Â Â

â

From the late 1990s to the mid 2000s, digital film restoration tools were introduced and disseminated among major film archives, with financial support from big film production companies.2 Â At first, due to the prohibitive costs for most institutions and archives, these tools were only utilized occasionally. However, technological advancements allowed them to become more affordable for non-commercial projects and more widely adopted into the film restoration process along the first decade of 2000s.Â

â

Digital technology was incorporated into the restoration workflow in Brazil in the early 21st century, similar to what was taking place in some European countries and in the United States. Up until that point in time, each stage of the restoration process was photochemical. Film restorers were utilizing analog machines that had been used for years in commercial film laboratories and the technical staff behind most restoration projects were predominantly trained while working for these laboratories. With the arrival of digital tools, interventions into the restoration process began to be carried out by computers and professionals with new skills. These new restorers were well versed in digital restoration software and computer-based technology and had different professional backgrounds than the technicians who had only previously worked in film laboratories. Before providing a further analysis of the digital restoration field in Brazil, it is first necessary to present an overview of the history of Brazilian film laboratories.

Film Laboratories in Brazil

During the first few decades of filmmaking in Brazil, most of the small film production companies had their own laboratories. It is likely that these laboratories used similar tools to still photography laboratories. In the chain of processing photochemical material, the negative is first developed and then copied to a positive print, resulting in projection prints. In the 1910s, Alberto Botelhoâs film laboratory took the first steps toward standardizing these procedures with above-average results. Consequently, their lab managed to create better film prints than what had previously been possible in Brazil. There are references to other laboratories of the time. For example, companies such as JosÃ© and Victor del Picchiaâs IndependÃªncia Film and Paulo Benedetti Filmes had laboratories and processed titles such as Braza Dormida (Mauro, 1928), Barro Humano (Gonzaga, 1929) and Limite (Peixoto, 1931). A landmark moment for the film processing field occurred in the late 1920s, when Hungarian photographers and laboratory professionals Adalberto Kemeny and Rudolf Lustig relocated to Brazil.3 Kemeny and Lustig would go on to buy the IndependÃªncia Film Laboratory and turn it into Rex Laboratories, which remained active until the 1970s. The technical knowledge that these Hungarian immigrants brought to Brazil allowed greater general control of the necessary parameters for processing film, such as temperature and time control, being responsible for improvements in the technical quality of Brazilian materials.

â

The transition to sound cinema in the 1930s made laboratory processing even more complex and progressively caused the closure of small laboratories from the silent period. Regardless of these newfound challenges in film processing, the production company CinÃ©dia, founded in 1930 by Adhemar Gonzaga, built its own laboratory in that decade.Â

The CinÃ©dia laboratory operated with many setbacks until the end of the 1940s, a particularly difficult period for the company. The context of World War II only exacerbated CinÃ©dia's difficulties, even causing them to momentarily shut down their operations at the end of 1941. In March 1942, the CinÃ©dia studios reopened for the filming of Orson Wellesâs It's All True, but only fully resumed productions the following year. The disastrous effects caused by the war, such as the lack of film stock and chemicals for processing films, was felt by CinÃ©dia throughout the decade. The toll of the war on CinÃ©dia culminated in their dismantling in 1949, when Adhemar Gonzaga decided to dispose of the laboratory film equipment. In 1951, Gonzaga interrupted CinÃ©dia's activities and sold part of the studio grounds in order to liquidate all the company's financial commitments. The laboratory was subsequently disassembled and its productions halted.Â

â

A historical milestone for film restoration in Brazil particularly relevant to this discussion was the creation of the only existing restoration laboratory in a Brazilian film archive. The Cinemateca Brasileira Film Laboratory was created in 1976 from the acquisition of equipment and parts discarded by the formerly-named LÃ­der CinelaboratÃ³rios,4 a company from Rio de Janeiro that had recently acquired Rex Laboratories with the purpose of expanding its business to SÃ£o Paulo. This acquisition began after LÃ­der CinelaboratÃ³rios was convinced that the Cinemateca Brasileira would not be a market competitor for them given their non-profit cultural mission. From then on, an informal partnership was established, and LÃ­der began to periodically notify the archive whenever old equipment was discarded.Â

â

Carlos Augusto Calil, who was leading the Preservation Department of the Cinemateca Brasileira at the time, managed this acquisition process. His sense of opportunity was essential to the success of the undertaking. Calil had the insight to take advantage of a singular moment - the discarding of the old Rex laboratories machinery. Once the new owners of Rex laboratories began to modernize their lab with new technology, they decided to dispose of their older (but still functional) machinery. Calil was then able to purchase this machinery at discounted prices as a means of bolstering the infrastructure of the Cinemateca's laboratory.

While the old laboratory machinery was being implemented at the Cinemateca Brasileira, Calil had the opportunity to attend the second Summer course organized by FIAF (International Federation of Film Archives) at the Staatlichesfilmarchiv (Film Archive of the German Democratic Republic). This course mainly addressed issues related to the conservation and restoration of films and it was very important for Brazilian professionals. During this course, Calil had access to publications on film documentation and cataloguing which had not yet been published in Brazil, materials that he would go on to share with his colleagues at the Cinemateca Brasileira. This ensured that the knowledge of the film preservation methods being used in foreign institutions would be shared and applied by Brazilian film preservationists in their own work. However, one of the major lessons that Calil learned was that the solution to Brazilâs film preservation problems would have to be invented and developed by Brazilians. This newfound understanding came to Calil from what is now a well-known story in the Brazilian audiovisual preservation community. Calil recounts that Hans KarnstÃ¤dt, the person in charge of the conservation and restoration laboratory of Staatlichesfilmarchiv, was asked about proper treatment for nitrate films that have become sticky. KarnstÃ¤dt was surprised with the question and answered that he had never seen any material in such condition. There are reasons for this can be pointed out: as Germany has a cold climate, and because their cultural institutions are financially stable (allowing the maintenance of adequate levels of temperature and humidity in the vaults), they never had to worry about scenarios where a large portion of their collections had undergone severe stages of degradation. But in Brazil, due to the hot climate and the chronic financial instability, sticky nitrate and acetate films were (and still are) a far more common occurrence. Although this situation happened four decades ago, the problems faced by Brazilian film archives and film preservationists have not changed substantially. The conservation conditions of most of the country's audiovisual heritage pose specific problems that only preservationists who have experience working in Brazil can solve.

Digital Film Restoration in Brazil: The Birth and the Rapid Decay of a Field

It was effectively at the end of May 1977 that the Cinemateca Brasileira Restoration Laboratory began duplication and restoration activities. One of the central figures for this was JoÃ£o SÃ³crates de Oliveira,5 a trained architect who entered the institution without previous experience in cinema, who went on to become an internationally renowned film restorer.Â

â

Between the 1970s and 2000s, film restoration projects in Brazil were mainly headed by film archives and carried out in partnership with commercial laboratories or by the Cinemateca Brasileira laboratory. The 2000s represented the growth of public investments in film preservation and the realization of a significant number of Brazilian film restoration projects. During this period, specific emphasis was given to the restoration of the titles of Cinema Novo filmmakers through projects led by their heirs. A few years later, in 2007 and 2009, Petrobras invested in two public calls for restoration coordinated by the Cinemateca Brasileira, attesting, albeit fleetingly, a more active role of the State in promoting and sponsoring film preservation.

At the turn of the millennium, in 1996, digital technology was used for the first time in Brazil during the restoration process of O Ã©brio (Gilda de Abreu, 1946), a CinÃ©dia production. Despite the fact that O Ã©brio had its image photochemically restored, the restoration process included a hybrid procedure for sound, mixing photochemical and digital elements. The re-release of O Ã©brio had been considered since the mid-1990s, as 1996 marked the fifty-year anniversary of its first screening. In March of that year, CinÃ©dia proposed the restoration project of what would have been the original version of the film to Riofilme,6 including its commercial re-release at the end of the process. One of the priorities of this project was ensuring that the film would return to the cinemas, which may be why this restoration project was presented to a distributor. By establishing a process where a newly restored film would be attached to a distributor, the restoration and exhibition of O Ãbrio would impact other restoration projects that followed a similar path. In 2002, Riofilme also carried out the digital reformatting and the re-release of another classic Brazilian title, Black God, White Devil (Rocha, 1964).

It was in 2003 that a project which can effectively be considered a milestone for digital film restoration in Brazil began: the restoration of the complete works of Joaquim Pedro de Andrade. This restoration project was realized by his daughters Alice and Maria, and his son Antonio de Andrade. The restoration of Joaquim Pedro de Andradeâs complete filmography was a pioneering initiative in the use of 2K digital resolution technology in Brazil. At that time, this kind of technology was mainly being used for the digital intermediation stages performed during post-production for contemporary films. Therefore, this was the first time that a Brazilian restoration project employed this tool. The restoration of Andradeâs filmography represents a definitive milestone for the preservation field in Brazil, as it led to a major technological update for the Restoration Laboratory of the Cinemateca Brasileira. In addition to this update of the Cinemateca lab, the Joaquim Pedro project led to the creation of the Restoration Center at Teleimage, an audiovisual post-production company in SÃ£o Paulo.

The pioneering initiative of using 2K resolution, and the scope of the project (to digitally restore the complete works of a filmmaker), made it possible for film restoration methodology to be practiced and improved by the archivists and technicians who were working on the project. As it was still an emerging field, the need for preservationists to gain experience with digital restoration tools was essential. After all, making a 2K digital restoration in Brazil was new for everyone involved, so this project represented a great challenge. It was around this time, precisely because of projects like Joaquim Pedro's, that many departments inside commercial post-production and finishing companies were created to exclusively focus on digitally restoring films. Mega Studios and Teleimage, both in SÃ£o Paulo, and Labocine in Rio de Janeiro were the major companies that were concentrating on digital restoration during that time.Â

Since 2000, Mega Studios7 has been investing in technological machinery, focusing on the acquisition of digital intermediation equipment. In 2001, they acquired a workstation called Restore, which consisted of a film restoration software built into an exclusive computer for the restoration process. This equipment, manufactured by the North-American company Da Vinci Systems (a pioneer in digital post-production equipment), cost $ 380,000 (about R$ 760,000 at the time). The station did not have the capacity to digitize. Instead, the materials had to be previously digitized by another machine (such as a telecine) in order to be used at the station. Because of this need for previous digitization, the cost of the entire restoration process was very high for Brazilian film archives at that time, leading to a situation where the post-production companies with larger budgets became primarily responsible for introducing restoration technology in Brazil.Â

â

Teleimage debuted its Restoration Department with the film PelÃ© Eterno (AnÃ­bal Massaini Neto, 2004), digitally correcting part of the archival footage in the documentary. This project took about five years to be completed and demanded a lot of work from the restorers. It was only after completing their first restoration that Teleimage decided to expand their restoration division with the digital restoration of Joaquim Pedro de Andrade's films.

â

Overall, Labocineâs experience with digital preservation was different to that of Teleimage and Mega Studios. However, it was similar in the sense that its restoration sector began by offering digital intermediation services. Labocine, Teleimage and Mega Studios used their existing structure as a basis for the inclusion of technology destined for the digital restoration of films. That is, they bought specific restoration software, computers with greater processing capacity, and servers with adequate storage capacity. However, instead of investing its time in restoring the works of renowned Cinema Novo filmmakers, Labocine decided to digitally restore Bonequinha de seda, a film made in 1936 by Oduvaldo Viana. Bonequinha de seda was produced by CinÃ©dia, a long-time partner of Labocine, which may have been the main reason why Labocine was interested in restoring the film. Restoring Bonequinha de seda presented the opportunity for Labocine to join an expanding national film restoration market. Also, restoring Bonequinha de seda as their first project, a work made almost 80 years ago, would allow them to stand out from other companies. However, the Bonequinha de seda restoration took much more time than what was initially expected. The restoration of the film, which included photochemical and digital tools, began in 2006 and took about seven years to be completed. The protracted length of the process was due to work interruptions which were caused by technical difficulties and the limited amount of funds available for the project.8 Unlike Mega Studios and Teleimage, Labocine did not have the volume of financial resources that a restoration project composed of several titles would have.9 While the restorations of the Glauber Rocha Collection and Joaquim Pedroâs filmography were well funded, the restoration of a single title made Labocine count on smaller investments. This meant that there were fewer professionals who were exclusively dedicated to the project, less equipment, and slower speed in the execution of the work. Despite the many challenges that this project faced, the effort to restore Bonequinha de seda was worthwhile due to the invaluable digital restoration experience that the technicians accumulated throughout the process.Â

â

The restoration of Bonequinha de seda ended up revealing the intrinsic limitations of new digital tools when dealing with scratches and abrasions that were incorporated photographically into the image (as shown below). The effectiveness of the Diamant restoration software (used in this process) during the first stages of digital treatment was minimal. This was because the tool could not locate the photographically incorporated scratches and abrasions that had become part of the image. Therefore, the first stages of digitally treating Bonequinha de seda revealed the inherent limitations of digital tools in fixing this type of damage. Also, after an attempt to use these digital tools to partially stabilize frames, the end product was even worse. The resulting creation presented numerous artifacts and the worsening of some of the photographically incorporated deformations.

Exhibiting samples of the work and consulting with specialists at international events revealed that the initially adopted procedures by the technicians in digitally restoring Bonequinha de seda were correct. However, the ability of the restoration software to deal with the damage presented on the film was not satisfactory. As a result, permanent communication was established between Labocine and the Diamant software developer company, HS-Art. Communicating the problems experienced in the Bonequinha de seda restoration made it possible for HS-Art to develop specific improvements to the software that would allow it to clean up the scratches and abrasions on the digital images.10

This story11 demonstrates that foreign digital restoration tools such as Diamant cannot completely respond to the specificity of the deterioration problems presented within Brazilian films.12 Because of this, establishing partnerships with restoration laboratories and software manufacturers is especially important for small projects that deal with materials in advanced stages of deterioration. In this sense, the idea of having a restoration laboratory in a film archive (such as at the Cinemateca Brasileira) is a strategic option, since a commercial laboratory will always aim at projects that are financially profitable.

â

The global incorporation of digital intermediation as part of the audiovisual post-production process in the mid-2000s seemed to bring enormous benefits for the field of film restoration. As digital intermediation became less expensive, it was widely adopted in the restoration procedures and subsequently lead to the development of new digital restoration tools and the area itself. Given the restoration projects that were being carried out since the turn of the millennium, Brazil appeared to be following a similar path of development in the restoration field to the rest of the world. However, unfortunately, the field of digital film restoration started to regress in 2010. In that year, due to a lack of funding to restoration projects, restoration departments such as the one at Mega Studios began to close. What was once considered a widening market soon became a niche service.Â

â

From mid-2010, the widespread adoption of digital technology in film production, distribution, and exhibition has led to a decrease of financial resources being invested into Brazilian film laboratories. Prior to that point, the major sources of income for these film laboratories had been making prints of foreign films to be distributed throughout Brazil. This is because it was mandatory that foreign films being released in Brazilian movie theaters produced their 35mm projection prints in Brazil. There is no denying that companies such as Labocine, Teleimage and Mega Studios have shown to be important partners of the previously mentioned restoration projects. But they were also commercial companies, primarily interested in maintaining a profit. The companies which had film laboratories, such as Labocine, severely diminished its profit margins with the decrease and later interruption in the production of 35mm film prints throughout the 2010s.Â

â

The volume of public investments in film restoration (and in audiovisual preservation in general) drastically reduced from 2011 onwards, and this has generated harmful consequences for the field. The first notable consequence occurred in 2015 after the Teleimage Restoration Center closed and the company dismissed its staff. Further, the consolidation of digital projection in the commercial exhibition circuit and the substantial reduction in the processing of 35mm prints (Labocineâs largest source of income) made it impossible for the company to continue in the long term. Since the closure of the Teleimage Restoration Center and Labocine in 2015, the film restoration field in Brazil has shrunk vertiginously, revealing that despite the initial contributions made by private companies, the sector was dependent on State resources and measures of market protection. With the exception of the Cinemateca Brasileira Restoration Laboratory, which has mainly focused on its own internal needs since 201613, the only option to digitally restore a film in Brazil today is the company Afinal Filmes, which started offering digital restoration services in 2017.Â There are projects and films to be restored, but there are no resources or public funding policies for this type of work. In fact, today, there are almost no public policies for film preservation (or for the audiovisual sector at large) in Brazil: the cultural field, in general, has been greatly affected by the government. However, in an area such as the audiovisual heritage field in Brazil, which has been historically ignored in terms of investments and marked by instability, the repercussions have been even worse. From a promising market to a struggling one in just over a decade, such is the current state of film restoration in Brazil.
