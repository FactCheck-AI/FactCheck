One album from Cariocas..

Yes a bit in the Freshmen style but more the brazillian Bossa than the Freshman program.

The FF had one album "Voices In Latin" which might be on that line.

An album I really like

"The Chico Hamilton Quintert: Ellington Suite" World Pacific Records WP-1258 - Reissued by King Record Co., Japan in 1983

in the series PACIFIC - UA Jazz Masterpieces (Vol 1) - not metioned on the cover "STEREO"

Original recorded January 9 & 12, 1959 - Original cover painting by Su√®o Serisawa in the series "West Coast artists"

Yeah, bossa nova style, but the four part harmonies are inspired on FF into a bossa sound!

Are you absolutely sure about that? I don't think it looks like her at all. (But, I've never seen a photo of her making a similar expression so I could be mistaken)

My favorite June Christy album is "Gone for the Day" I have all of them.

It's definitely June Christy on the Coop! album.

How do you know for real that the girl on that album is June Christy?. I would like to know why you are so sure that she is June, because I do not have that record and perhaps it is written on the back cover somewhere!. Thanks in advance!

I read it in a book, but I'm no longer sure which one. Still, consider the eyebrows.

I agree my guy, I recently did a June Christy purge and I found myself dropping a sizable chunk of her capitol era, BUT KEPT THIS ONE-
