Aikido is a Japanese martial art that was developed in the early 20th century by Morihei Ueshiba. Ueshiba was a martial artist who studied various martial arts, including Daito-ryu Aiki-jujutsu, and combined them to create Aikido. Ueshiba’s goal was to create a martial art that could be used to defend oneself without causing injury to the attacker.

Aikido is based on the principles of non-resistance and harmony. It emphasizes circular movements and the use of joint locks and throws to control an attacker. Aikido practitioners strive to use the attacker’s energy against them, rather than relying on strength or aggression.

Aikido has become popular around the world, and is practiced by millions of people. It is often used in self-defense classes, and is also used in law enforcement and military training. Aikido is also used in sports, such as judo and mixed martial arts.
