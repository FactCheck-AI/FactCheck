Love Jones co-stars Nia Long and Larenz Tate will have reoccurring roles on the second season of Showtime’s newest comedy House of Lies, which also stars Oscar-nominated actor Don Cheadle.

According to IndieWire, Tate will play Cheadle’s younger, less ambitious, activist brother while Long plays a fellow consultant to Cheadle’s character, Marty.

Based on the book, House of Lies: How Management Consultants Steal Your Watch and Tell You the Time, the show takes a gritty look at a self-loathing management company from a top-tier firm in which Cheadle plays a highly successful, cutthroat consultant who will do just about anything or anyone to get what he wants.

Shooting begins next month in Los Angeles. Check out this new spot promoting season two…
