This includes a new state-of-the-art seven acre site to be known as City Campus East, adjacent to the main campus, which will house the Schools of Law, Design and the Newcastle Business School.

Improvements to the City Campus West are also ongoing, and include a new footbridge timelapse linking the East and West Campuses across the central motorway, pedestrianisation and greening of the integrated teaching environment. The first phase of the expansion is due to be completed by September 2007.

The development project suffered a setback when, on the 9th April 2007, a building that was to be student flats burned to the ground during the night. The nearby School of Design also suffered minor heat damage before the blaze was brought under control. [1]

History

Northumbria University has its origins in three regional colleges: Rutherford College of Technology, the College of Art & Industrial Design and the Municipal College of Commerce. An amalgamation of these three institutions formed the Newcastle Polytechnic in 1969, which became the major regional centre for the training of teachers with the incorporation of the City College of Education in 1974, and the Northern Counties College of Education in 1976.

Northumbria was inaugurated as a university in 1992, under the name University of Northumbria at Newcastle. The trading name was simplified to Northumbria University in 2002.
