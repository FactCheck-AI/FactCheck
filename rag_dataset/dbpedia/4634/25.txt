Well, he had to trace their Ki in order to find them. But what he mimicked was Kai Kai as said by Goku himself. He copied the technique right after Kibitoshin performed it. He never saw Instant Transmission. You don't need any Ki signature to teleport with Kai Kai.

i just reread it, youre right goku said it was kibitoshins move

Kid Buu was using it to teleport from planet to planet destroying everyone where he couldn't find Goku. Kid Buu went to the Other World and was about to kill all the dead spirits so Goku and Vegeta charged their ki so Kid Buu could home in on it. He still used instant transmision though

dont use filler to try to explain yourself

Kid Buu has instant transmission. Gotenks doesn't. Kid Buu can breathe in space. Gotenks can. Kid Buu can instant transmission to space and blow up the planet from space and theres nothing Gotenks can do about it.

Considering how far gotenks was from the planet when he circled it, he really wouldn't be able to do that without being able to breathe in space.

Although that feat probably isn't taken that way.

Kid Buu can try to teleport but he gets speedblitzed, not sure he can teleport when immobilised. He's never been able to do it in battle, infact any character who can teleport in battle does'nt do it unless the opponent is standing still. Goku was already charging his Kamehameha while Cell was standing still panicking of Earth going boom. Goku could'nt IT either against Vegeta and Kid Buu could'nt do it either against the Spirit Bomb.

Even with Super Buu is enough to hand this to Gotenks.

you mean after they said he got weaker. but it doesnt matter, it obviously wasnt enough to terrify goku like super boos ki did

Nah, not that. Right after they ripped Fat Buu from Shin Buu, Goku said Majin Buu's Ki was rising as he was increasingly becoming bigger. Kibitoshin then said that was the form he took after absorbing South Kaioshin. Thing is, Kaio's don't make Majin Buu stronger.

1. Babidi said they couldn't use East Kaioshin's energy to fill Buu's cocoon.

2. Dai Kaioshin made Majin Buu weaker

With that, it'd be contradictory to think absorbing South Kaioshin would boost his power. At best it doesn't make him any stronger. At worst it weakens him.

Try again.

Where did you get that SSJ Gotenks was stronger than SSJ3 Goku? Especially that much stronger.

Strawman much?

Super Saiyan Gotenks was giving Super Buu problems.

Use some common sense. Also the multipler for power levels with Super Saiyan transformations in the Daizenshuus and Super Exciting Guide corrobates what was shown in the manga during said fight. And then there's also fusion dance also increasing power levels on its own anyways.

well the only problem is that east kaioshin is the weakest of the kais, im pretty sure he admitted this himself. and as seen with all of boo's fights he only absorbs people that would boost his power. Dai kaioshin didnt make boo weaker it just made boo not use the full extent of his powers ( or maybe his good ki canceled out some of the negative ki, so maybe it did make him weaker)

No he wasn't. Gotenks resorted to SSJ3 in order to compete with Majin Buu.

Japanese and French version have it clearly stated that Dai Kaioshin tamed Buu AND made him weaker. Contrary to the popular belief that it only made him gentler, the original says something different.

Don't use a filler to try and explain myself? Was the filler not created by the same person who made the manga? It doesn't matter. It took Buu only a matter of seconds to destroy the earth. Now I ask one more time, what is stopping Kid Buu from teleporting into space and destroying it again?. A speed blitz? The teleporting technique takes no prep.

No 99/100 times filler was made by completely different people. whats stopping him from doing it is he obviously cant do it mid fight.

So he is able to do something out of fight that he can do mid-fight? That doesn't make the least bit of sense. Goku did it mid-fight against Cell with the instant transmission kamahameha. So what's stopping Kid Buu from doing it mid-fight?

goku did it when cell was at least 200 feet away from him and standing still. he never did it against a moving opponent. and thats due to the fact that he didnt do it against goku.

So just because they didn't do it, that does not mean they couldn't do it? You're basing that with your own opinion. So someone doesn't shoot a gun at a tiger from a feet a way doesn't mean they can't.

no, every time someone teleported they didnt do it mid fight. the burden of proof is on you.

So when Gohan, Piccolo, and Krillin was fighting Freeza and they were trying to attack him but he kept dodging, but then he appeared behind them. Is that or is that not teleporting. And I'm still waiting on proof for you where it says they couldn't teleport.
