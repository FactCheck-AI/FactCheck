Burnout Dominator is best thought of as a "Greatest Hits, but Not All of Them" from the Burnout series. The racing is just as adrenaline pumping as it's ever been, and possibly even more so than what we saw in Burnout Revenge as you need to be afraid of traffic once again. However, the lack of standard features and modes like Crash are a rather big disappointment. It's more worthy of a pickup on the PSP than the PS2 however as its simply more impressive as a handheld game and the multiplayer features are much more robust.

This game is a simplified Burnout 3. Having an almost-identical gameplay as Burnout 3 (Compared to Burnout Revenge), this game still keeps the essence of Burnout. They ditched Crash Mode but at the same time they added more daredevil modes where you dash through traffic and gets rewarded with dangerous driving. They are too similar to each other, however (Near Miss, Drift and Burnout Challenge, with Maniac being a mix of all three), so there isn't very much of a variety. Also, they merged shortcuts with signature takedowns, and some of them are pretty annoying.

One of the best racing games on PSP. It's fun and addictive, making you want to get gold in every course. Gameplay's also great, with a nice sense of speed. Good graphics, even for PSP. Overall, a good game to play and forget your worries.
