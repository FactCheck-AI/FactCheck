After attending boarding school and receiving private tutoring, Madison attended what is now Princeton University in New Jersey. He returned to his family’s home, Montpelier, in 1772. He became a colonel in the Virginia militia, and he represented Orange County in the Virginia Convention of 1776. He befriended Thomas Jefferson soon after, and he worked with George Mason to draft the constitution of Virginia. He became a member of the Continental Congress in 1780. He returned to Virginia several years later, serving in the state legislature. There, he aided in the passing of a document written by Jefferson, Virginia’s Statute of Religious Freedom.

He later attended the Constitution Convention, representing Virginia. This was followed by his election to the House of Representatives in 1789. Madison was instrumental in the writing of the Bill of Rights. He is often referred to as the Father of the Constitution because of his work on the United States Constitution.
