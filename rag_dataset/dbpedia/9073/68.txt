Top 3 thriving countries in eyelash extension manufacturing

The United States, China, and Vietnam are the top three countries in wholesale eyelash extension manufacturing. This section will highlight the unique characteristics of bulk lash providers in these three manufacturing countries.

The United States

The United States is a key player in the global eyelash extension supply chain. This country has a large population of bulk lash production in the North American region. Below are some characteristics of wholesale lash providers in this country.

Influenced by beauty trends and grooming culture: Bulk eyelash suppliers in the United States can quickly adopt the latest fashion and beauty trends in their production facility. This country also has a strong history of beauty and grooming, with many beauty salons and spas offering lash extension services for various customer bases. This country’s lash and beauty industry is also influenced by influencers and celebrities on social media channels.

Being innovative in lash products and services: Most bulk lash suppliers in the United States have high consumer awareness. These suppliers apply the latest technological inventions to their products and services. For example, LUUM Lashes has revolutionized the global lash industry by using machine learning and robotics to lash applications.

Well-known eyelash suppliers: Some of the best eyelash suppliers in the United States provide eyelashes and related products to beauty salons, spas, and individual lash technicians. Xtreme Lashes, Bella Lash, and Lash FX are a few of these.

The United States is a pioneer in the global lash extension industry. Many reputable wholesale lash suppliers in this North American country are highly recommended for domestic and foreign clients by adopting new trends in fashion and beauty and technological advancements.

China

China is the global leader in eyelash extensions. It also holds the largest revenue in the eyelash extension industry, with over 80% of lashes made in this country.

The fast-growing market for lash extension production: The Chinese eyelashes market size was USD 1.26 billion in 2021. This market will continue to broaden due to the rising demand for eyelash extensions and the improved income of Chinese people.

Major industrial hubs: Qingdao in Shandong Province, or the “Eyelash Capital,” is the primary production hub for lash extension manufacturing in China and globally. This region accounts for approximately 70% of global lash production, with various best eyelash suppliers. Beyond Qingdao, some clusters like Jixi City in Liaoning Province, some cities in Guangdong Province (Dongguan, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou), etc.

Numerous eyelash options: Chinese eyelash suppliers have expansive production facilities, allowing them to provide various eyelash options for their clients. For instance, they provide many lash material options, from synthetic ones (like PBT) to natural ones like mink or silk. These production plants also have different lashproperties (lengths, thicknesses, colors, and curls). Most are open to pre-made fans for faster application or private-labeling options for your custom lash branding identities.

Large production capability: Wholesale lash suppliers in China have large-scale production facilities and experience, allowing them to handle bulk orders of lashes with relatively low MOQs (from 5 trays). For example, Qingdao Xizi Lashes can make 0.8-1 million pairs per month, offering over 800 types of eyelash strips and extensions. Alternatively, Qingdao T-integrity Lash Factory has a significant output capacity, producing around 36 million pairs annually.

China is a dominant player in the competitive lash extension industry, handling over 80% of lashes globally. This country is still the market leader, thanks to its years of experience in bulk lash production, a highly skilled workforce, and modern production facilities. However, this trend is changing in other Asian countries like Vietnam due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in the income of Chinese workers.

Vietnam

Vietnam is a new emerging player in the global wholesale eyelash extension market. After the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a major shift in bulk lash production from China to Vietnam. Some characteristics of wholesale Vietnamese lash suppliers:

Promising key exporter: Vietnam is a promising key global eyelash exporter to Southeast Asia and beyond. This growth trend results from factors such as the rising awareness of eyelash extensions, the flourishing beauty industry with domestic demand for eyelash extensions, and the solid focus on lash product quality. In the meantime, the rising labor costs in China have increased product prices from Chinese bulk suppliers, making Vietnam a great alternative to China.

Experience in bulk production for the global market: Vietnam has a skilled workforce with competitive labor costs compared to China or other countries. Most of the best eyelash suppliers in this country require low MOQs and modern technological advancements, perfectly catering to the international demands of wholesale clients.

Vietnam is a promising dreamland for Southeast Asia and global wholesale lash production. Eyelash suppliers in this country have extended experience and a skilled workforce, catering to bulk orders of foreign clients with the latest technological advancements, high affordability, and a customer-centric mindset.
