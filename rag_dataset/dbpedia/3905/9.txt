Ghosts and the Afterlife is the first truly scientific investigation into ghosts and the hereafter. The film features James Van Praagh (creator and executive producer of "Ghost Whisperer"), Dr. Vernon Sylvest, M.D. (pathologist), Dr. Kenneth Rose (Harvard Ph.D. in philosophy and world religions), Psychics Eddie Conner, Justin Terry and Reverend F. Reed Brown, Dr. Jeffrey Rediger, M.D. (Harvard Professor and researcher into the phenomena of life-after-death experiences and spiritual healing), Dr. Norm Shealy, M.D., Ph.D., Raymond A. Moody Jr. (author of the best-selling book Life After Life), Captain Frederick "Skip" Atwater (the Operations Officer in charge of the top-secret military Star Gate program that investigated consciousness beyond the physical mind) and many others.

The program is narrated on-camera by Kelsey Bohlen with special guest appearances by the late EmmyÂ® award-winning Jay Thomas (Murphy Brown, Cheers, Mr. Holland's Opus); this was Thomas' last film project.

Lise Romanoff, Managing Director/CEO of Vision Films says, "This is a fascinating look at the consistently reported encounters people have experienced with near, after-death and ghost encounters throughout time. Whether one believes in ghosts or not, you will find the research and firsthand stories undeniably mesmerizing."

Director Steve Sayre, who has experienced two after-death experiences after suffering serious injury in the military, has this to say about the film's findings, "After having experienced life after death myself on two occasions, and considering the volumes of scientific and experiential evidence uncovered during the 12 years the film has been in production, there is no doubt that life continues after what we refer to as death."
