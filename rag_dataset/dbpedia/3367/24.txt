About Louisville City FC

Since its launch in 2014, Louisville City FC has been committed to serving the community of Louisville as the city’s lone professional soccer team. The 2017 season marked the third year of play for LouCity in the United Soccer League (USL), a professional soccer league based in the United States and Canada. On October 26, the Louisville Metro Council voted overwhelmingly in favor of a new soccer-specific stadium in the Butchertown neighborhood with a projected opening slated for March 2020.
