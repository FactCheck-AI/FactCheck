EXCLUSIVE: Gotham and Shameless actor Cameron Monaghan is set to star in supernatural thriller The White Devil, directed by South African filmmaker Jahmil Qubeka.

Roberi Media and Spier Films will finance and produce the title, which begins shooting in Cape Town, South Africa, in the spring. Qubeka will direct from a script he adapted with Julian Paul Stein from Justin Evans’ 2011 novel.

The story sees a young American high school senior, who hopes to put his past behind him when he is enrolled by his father into a prestigious British boys’ academy. Soon he learns that the school has a past as well – one haunted by a vengeful former student who quickly forms an unhealthy attachment to him.

Robert L. Stein and Michael Auret will produce with Morris Ruskin as exec producer. Shoreline Entertainment is handling foreign sales for the title, which will be shopped to buyers at the American Film Market.

Monaghan is best known for his work on Showtime’s hit series Shameless, which kicked off its seventh season this month. He’s worked on feature films such as Phillip Noyce-directed The Giver and upcoming Amityville Horror.

Roberi Media financed and produced suspense thriller The Call, starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin; The Road Within, starring Dev Patel, Zoe Kravitz and Robert Sheehan; and Careful What You Wish For, starring Nick Jonas, Isabel Lucas and Dermot Mulroney. Recent titles from Spier Films include the Mads Mikkelsen-Eva Green starrer The Salvation and Young Ones, a sci-fi Western starring Michael Shannon, Nicholas Hoult and Elle Fanning. Morris Ruskin’s credits include Glengarry Glen Ross and The Man From Elysian Fields.

Monaghan is repped by Industry Entertainment, UTA and Chad Christopher.
