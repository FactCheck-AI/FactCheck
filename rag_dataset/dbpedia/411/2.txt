Archers from around the world will let their nocked arrows fly toward the targets at the 2024 Paris Olympics starting one day before the Opening Ceremony. The competition begins on Thursday, July 25 and runs through Sunday, Aug. 4.

The competition schedule includes individual and team events for both men and women as well as a mixed team event. Each day of the archery competition will be broken out into two sessions per day.

Three-time American Olympic medalist Brady Ellison will compete in the men’s individual at what will be his fifth Olympic Games. Entering the Tokyo Games, Ellison was the top-ranked men’s archer in the world, but had an early exit from the tournament after he lost to Gazoz in the quarterfinals. Ellison also failed to reach the quarterfinals at the 2023 World Championships and will likely have an outside chance to win a medal in Paris.

In the women's individual competition, Casey Kaufhold will give the U.S. its best chance of winning a medal in Olympic archery. She made her Olympic debut at age 17 during the 2020 Tokyo Games. Kaufhold also finished second at the 2021 World Championships and fourth at the 2023 Worlds in the women’s individual event.
