What is Agile?

Agile is an approach to project management that centers around incremental and iterative steps to completing projects. The incremental parts of a project are carried out in short-term development cycles. The approach prioritizes quick delivery, adapting to change, and collaboration rather than top-down management and following a set plan.

In the Agile process, there is continuous feedback, allowing team members to adjust to challenges as they arise and stakeholders an opportunity to communicate consistently. Though originally created for software development, the Agile approach is now widely used in executing many different types of projects and in running organizations.

Contrast this with any traditional method of project management. Traditional project management generally progresses linearly through planning, designing, implementation, and closing stages. One stage must be completed before moving to the next one. Â Â

If you're considering learning Agile to advance your project management career, you might consider boosting your resume with a certificate. You can earn a career certificate from Google by completing their Agile Project Management course or complete the entire course series to earn the Google Project Management Professional Certificate.

Agile pros and cons

Although Agile is gaining in popularity and has a host of advantages, itâs not without its challenges. Below are some of the benefits and drawbacks Agile users faced, according to Digital.aiâs 2024 State of Agile Survey [1].

When should you use Agile project management?

The tenets of Agileâadaptability, iteration, continuous delivery, and short time frames, among othersâmake it a project management style thatâs better suited for ongoing projects and projects where certain details arenât known from the outset. That means if a project doesnât have clear constraints, timelines, or available resources, itâs a good candidate for an Agile approach.

For example, designing and launching new products might push project teams against several unforeseen challenges. Having an Agile approach can mean projects already have the methodology to test products as often as needed, iterate quickly, and communicate changes with project stakeholders.

Traditional project management approaches like Waterfall can be easier to plan out and progress easier to measure. This can make projects with clearly demarcated constraints (like a strict budget or timeline), or projects where teams are expected to work independently of stakeholders better suited for traditional approaches.

Industries that use Agile methods

Agile grew from the minds of a group of software development project managers. Since then, it has continued to be popular in software development, but has expanded to many other industries as well. These include finance, IT, business, fashion, biotechnology, and even constructionâamong many others.

Using both Agile methods and Waterfall methods

Not all projects fit neatly into one category or the other. For projects that might benefit from elements of both a traditional approach and iterative approach, an Agile-Waterfall hybrid approach can make sense. This could mean, for example, that planning and design are done in Waterfall, but development is carried out in short development cycles, Agile-style.

Agile methodologies and frameworks

There are several Agile methodologies and frameworks, each with its own pros and cons. Some are hybrids of multiple methodologies. Scrum is the most commonly used Agile methodology. Digital.ai found that 63 percent of Agile adopters use Scrum [1].

Popular Agile methodologies include:

Scrum

Kanban

Lean

Crystal

Extreme Programming (XP)

Feature-Driven Development (FDD)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)

ScrumBan

Agile-Waterfall/Hybrid Agile

Scrum XP Hybrid

Scaling methods

Agile scaling methods are used to implement Agile practices across multiple teams, or entire organizations. There are several scaling methods, including the following:

Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe)

Scrum of Scrums

Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD)

Large Scale Scrum (LSS or LeSS)

Enterprise Scrum

Lean Management

Agile Portfolio Management (APM)

Nexus

Agile values and principles

Agile project management was established on four values and twelve principles. These values and principles are rooted in the Agile Manifesto, which was created in 2001 by seventeen managers of software development [2]. Much of the philosophy that underpins the Agile Manifesto came about in reaction to what people perceived as the bottlenecks of software development processes at the time.

Agile Values

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools: While tools and processes are important, the Agile Manifesto prioritizes the people behind them. Having the right people in place and empowering them to interact smoothly with each other can lead to successes that tools by themselves wonât be able to.

Working software over comprehensive documentation: The creators of Agile believed that it was more important to get stuff done than get bogged down in the planning and documentation stages.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation: Instead of siloing stakeholders off from the project, Agile aims to maintain contact with them throughout the creation process.

Responding to change over following a plan: Following a plan that doesnât make sense to follow anymore can be counterproductive. Adaptation is central to the Agile philosophy.

The twelve principles define early and frequent delivery, simplicity, constant feedback, the collaboration of interested parties, and individual support, among other principles, as the pillars of Agile project management [3].

Agile certifications

Certifications in Agile project management can verify your knowledge of Agile as a whole, or in specific Agile methodologies. Think about what skills youâll likely use in your workplace and career before deciding on which certification to get.

Common Agile certifications include:

PMI-Agile Certified Practitioner (PMI-ACP)

ICAgile Certified Professional (ICP)

AgilePM Foundation - APMG

You can also consider a certification in a specific framework. Scrum is the most commonly used Agile method, so a Scrum certification could be a good place to start. These include:

Certified ScrumMaster (CSM)

Professional Scrum Master (PSM)

Certified Scrum Product Owner (CSPO)
