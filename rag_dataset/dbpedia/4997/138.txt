Looks like another 'own goal' for GMG. With stats on the slide since the Saga rebranding this will ailenaite more local listeners and probably gift more listeners to BBC Radio 2 and Clyde 2.

When the Ofcom proposals re formats arrive in 2008 I suspect there may be many more shows networked. Not a great prospect for listeners and Ofcom research shows that daytime programming is the most valued by local audiences. Perhaps GMG simply dont care!

I think its yet another case of GMG buying a station and then not knowing what to with it. The other Saga stations make a fit with the Real stations but this doesn't apply in Glasgow where Real Scotland already ruled the airwaves.

I still think EMAP should have snapped up the Saga stations and put Clyde2/ Magic on fm.

Perhaps the thread title is a bit prusumptious...

Is Dave Marshall confirmed as leaving Smooth Glasgow?

He could be moving to an alternative time slot, however he may have decided that he no longer wants to play the GMG game and has chosen to leave a station that is now quite different from the one he left Clyde for.

It'll be interesting to see the eventual outcome but whatever materialises I doubt that Mark Goodier will improve the fortunes of the Glasgow station.

Bit of a stupid idea isn't it when you're competing with Radio 2 at that time and Ken Bruce is on there.I would think they'd want to sound more local.If they are going to carry London programmes in daytime i should think most evening and night programmes plus weekends will soon go the same way.

They can only do 3 hours in daytime even under the new rules. 7pm-3am could also be networked though.

I don't understand the suggestion that replacing a local jock with a top DJ like Mark Goodier (whose show will still have local news and drop-ins) will gift listeners to BBC Radio 2, where there is no local content whatsoever.

Didn't Goodier use to present the same slot on Radio 2 (as relief for Ken Bruce)?

I would have thought Glasgow was a special case for not networking!.You have to appreciate that the Scots like and should expect a better local service than other parts of the UK,they should not be having to have a network programme from London.I was only making the Radio 2 reference as there will be a Scottish presenter on there while Mark Goodier is on Smooth and i would have thought given the choice between those two national shows Glasgow listeners would prefer Ken.I actually think more people would tune instead to Radio Scotland or Real.GMG's strategy for Glasgow Smooth seems to be seriously flawed,they seem to want to lose listeners,don't know why they don't sell it off if they can't provide a genuine alternative to Real..

Burke is staying as Head of Presentation.

Remember, he wasn't on air regularly for the first two years of SAGA

Ignorning the 'newbie's' obvious distasteful flaming.....

Interesting, but a bit of a luxury perhaps. I suppose he will go back to being the relief jock when any of the daytime line-up goes off.

Can't imagine that a full time head of presentation role is justified for a station like Smooth Glasgow unless GMG indend to make it far more autonomous, which might not be a bad idea bearing in mind how the new service has performed compared with the one it replaced.

It'll never work in Glasgow & i'm sure the feeling is the same with the other Smooths in the Midlands. What's going to happen to local content, news stories, etc. will the studio phone just ring off the wall for 3 hours every day?

surely that can't be good. Glad Dave isn't leaving as he is probably the most likeable jock in the city.

Also heard a rumour that alex dickson is going to Smooth - anyone know anything about that?

Apparently EMAP decided that the book review show had run it's course and it was dropped in favour of music shows.

Alex Dickson will present the show on Smooth Glasgow in what is probably more of a coup for radio insiders benefit than a popular feature for listeners.

Blatent opportunisim and personal retribution that probably won't remain on Smooth Glasgow for long....but the symbolisim is significant, a major endorrssment, so it needent.

While I agree that the book programme had run its course I am disappointed that Clyde 2 has become just like most other am stations recently. One of its strengths previously was the wide range of music combined with specialist programming. The changes have resulted in a sharp drop in listeners.

Can't help feeling that If GMG want to plug a gap in the market and also win back some of the ex Saga listeners in Glasgow and the West then a Clyde 2 type offering on fm may just be the way forward.

One piece of good news....I understand that Mike Marwick's rock and roll show will return on Smooth, Saturday tea time 5 - 8.

He has been doing a soul show at that time since the demise of Saga but it will be great to see/hear him back presenting his real love.
