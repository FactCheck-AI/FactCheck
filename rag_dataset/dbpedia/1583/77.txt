Ever since I can remember, I’ve been singing this song about George Fox, a man who is widely regarded as the founder of The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

When I became a singer-songwriter and started sharing some of my music with Quakers, I started getting a lot of requests for it. Though I was never a “singalong” musician (I have my own song that I wrote about Fox), I loosened up and learned the chords. If you’re looking to learn how to play the George Fox Song, I’ll post the chords and lyrics just below this video.

Lyrics

There’s a Light that is shining in the Heart of a man

It’s the Light that was shining when the world began

There’s a Light that is shining in the Turk and the Jew

There’s a Light that is shining, friend, in me and in you.

*chorus*

Walk in the Light, wherever you may be

Walk in the Light, wherever you may be

With my old leather britches and my shaggy, shaggy locks

I am walking in the glory of the Light, said Fox

With a book and a steeple and a bell and a key

Well they’ll bind you forever, but they can’t, said he

For the book, it will perish and the steeple will fall

And the Light will be shining at the end of it all.

(chorus)

If we give you a pistol, will you fight for the Lord?

But you can’t kill the devil with a gun or a sword.

Will you swear on the Bible? “I will not!” said he,

“For the Truth is more holy than the book to me.”

(chorus)

There’s an ocean of darkness and I drown in the night

Til I come through the darkness to the ocean of Light

and the Light is forever, and the Light it is free

And I walk in the glory of the Light, said he.
