Jeweller Joyalukkas’ latest collection, unveiled in Singapore on April 20, is a tribute to the love and devotion immortalised in the epic Ramayana.

The Sita Kalyanam bridal collection is a celebration of the union of Lord Rama and his soulmate Sita.

The painstakingly crafted ornaments capture the essence of traditional temple jewellery, as each piece is designed to be an integral part of a bride’s trousseau. Made by expert Indian craftsmen, the collection is the epitome of meticulous workmanship and uncompromising attention to detail.

“We are celebrating our rich Indian heritage and paying tribute to the mythical divinity of one of the world’s epic bonds of love with the Sita Kalyanam bridal collection,” said Joyalukkas Group’s managing director John Paul Alukkas.

“This unique collection is designed for the modern bride who cherishes traditional Indian values. At Joyalukkas, we strive to create jewellery that exemplifies style and signifies superior value. The Sita Kalyanam bridal collection too is inspired by this philosophy.”

During the launch at Joyalukka’s main showroom on Serangoon Road, four pieces from the Sita Kalyanam collection were presented, each illustrating a different wedding ritual.

“The Indian community in Singapore is emotionally connected to their roots, and the Sita Kalyanam collection depicts just that – pure tradition,” said Joyalukkas’ regional manager Freddy Paul. “What we have produced is something very special, each piece tells its own unique story. The jewellery is exquisitively carved and moulded. The face, the eyes, everything has been captured in detail.”

The Sita Kalyanam collection is available at all three Joyalukkas showrooms in Little India and across its outlets in 11 countries.

“In Singapore, we always have a demand for traditional jewellery,” said Joyalukkas’ marketing manager (international operations) Dileep P. Nair. “We mostly cater to wedding ceremonies, anniversaries and birthdays.”
