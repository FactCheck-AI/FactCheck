My iPad / iPhone already has a GPS - why do I need this?

The iPhone and the 3G models of the iPad include an internal GPS, however the internal GPS is made for use on the ground and is not very reliable in the air. You will find that you experience intermittent outages from the internal GPS while flying. The Dual XGPS160 is a WAAS-enabled, GLONASS capable, super reliable and accurate, GPS receiver that you can count on both on the ground and in the air.
