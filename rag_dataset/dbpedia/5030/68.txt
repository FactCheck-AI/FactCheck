On the weekend of 28-29 November 2020, a remote EUROLOCKING interlocking system was successfully put into operation for the first time at Transports Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) in Vuadens.

It is especially characterised since it only has an object controller for signals, points and axle counters, but does not have its own computer unit. The interlocking computer is shared by the system in Vuadens with the EUROLOCKING in Châtel-Saint-Denis. Due to its system design structure with three powerful and highly available interlocking computers in a 1 of 3 system, EUROLOCKING has a very solid basis for a cost-effective and economical system design structure with a main interlocking and various remote interlockings at other stations.

In addition to the remote EUROLOCKING, a further innovation was put into operation. A remote relay line block to the neighbouring interlocking in Bulle (type SIMIS W), which is completely housed in the interlocking room in Bulle and connected via fibre optic cable to the EUROLOCKING interlocking computer in Châtel-Saint-Denis, controls the train traffic between the stations of Vuadens and Bulle. This significantly reduced the need for copper cable and bypassed the limitation of the range via fibre optic connection.

Having already commissioned a new EUROLOCKING in Villars-sous-Mont three weeks earlier, Vuadens is the sixth installation with EUROLOCKING. The next installation will follow in January 2021. At this point, EUROLOCKING will be debut another achievement: It is the first application on a standard gauge railway and thus, the first application with ETCS.
