Sir Michael Caine attended this school up to his 16th birthday

Location: Mollison Drive, Wallington, SM6 9JW

Description: The 'Legend'... 'Michaet Caine' was born Maurice Joseph Micklewhite in Rotherhithe, South East London, the son of Ellen Frances Marie (nee Burchell), a cook and charlady, and Maurice Joseph Micklewhite, a fish market porter.

Now Sir Michael Caine, CBE (born 14 March, 1933), Caine has appeared in more than 100 films and is one of only two actors to have been nominated for an Academy Award for acting (leading or supporting) in every decade since the 1960s (Jack Nicholson being the other).

And so to this school 'Wilson's Grammar School' (now Wilson's School) in Wallington, South London, which Michael once attended.

He left at sixteen after gaining a School Certificate in six subjects - and the rest they say is history.
