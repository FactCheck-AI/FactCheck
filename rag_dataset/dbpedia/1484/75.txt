HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- As fall approaches, so does Houston's November general election.

Houstonians will elect a new mayor in addition to voting for city councilmembers and the city controller.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner is term-limited after serving as mayor since 2016. So no matter who wins, Houston will elect a new mayor for the first time in eight years.

Here's everything you need to know before you go to the polls.

When is the November election?

The 2023 general election will be held on Tuesday, Nov. 7 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at voting sites throughout the city.

The winners of the election will begin their terms of office on Jan. 2, 2024.

Sample ballots will be available approximately 45 days before the election.

When is the deadline to register to vote?

The deadline to register to vote in the November general election is Oct. 10, 2023.

You can register to vote by visiting harrisvotes.org.

When is early voting?

Early voting will run from Oct. 23 through Nov. 3., from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at select polling locations across the city.

When is the deadline to vote by mail?

The last day to apply for a ballot by mail -- received, not postmarked -- is Oct. 27.

Mail-in ballots must be filled out and received by Nov. 7 at 7 p.m. if the carrier envelope is not postmarked. If the carrier envelope is postmarked by 7 p.m. on Election Day, it must be received by 5 p.m. the next business day after the election, Nov. 8.

Has my district changed? What district am I in?

Your district for voting for your city councilmember may have changed since the last election. The city council approved new district boundaries on Oct. 12, 2022 as part of the redistricting process after the 2020 federal census.

Houstonians can visit the city's redistricting website to view maps and determine which council district they reside in.

If needed, when is the runoff election?

A date has not yet been set, but should a runoff election be necessary, it is typically held on a Saturday in December.
