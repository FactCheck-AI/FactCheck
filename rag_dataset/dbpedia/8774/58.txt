About Greater Giyani

Known as the 'land of the friendly people' and the 'place where the people dance', was officially established in 1969. It is the administrative and commercial centre of the Mopani district and also the former capital of Gazankulu.

Giyani's Central Business District is a lively informal business sector which should not be missed. Traditional African Cuisine such as matomani (mopani worms), tihove (samp), muroho, teepe, leroto and vuswa (mealie meal) are on the menu all day long for visitors to experience.

We believe that our lives are meant for more than just routine 9-5, that our crushing resentment of habituation need not be the beginning and the end. We believe that travel is good for the soul as it rejuvenates, offers perspective, creates excitement and offers a chance to discover new meaning and purpose.

We are passionate travelers who have designed the ultimate single platform to rid the stress, complication and effort of travel planning.

We present an evolving digital space for you to gain inspiration, research, plan and book your next travel experience with ease and vigor. We are an online travel agency here to make your next travel experience better and better.
