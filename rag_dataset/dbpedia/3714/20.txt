Nice and Jazzy 5

Iam a big fan of Mika's. I think that she is so beautiful and so is her voice. I kinda liked her NANA music, though. I thought that she might continue it. But, she went back to her roots. I was a little disappointed. Then, I got this single. It is really good. Her vocals are just amazing. "Cry No More" is a soft jazzy number that is soothing to listen to. "Black and Blue" is a funner jazz song. I think I like it more than the first.
