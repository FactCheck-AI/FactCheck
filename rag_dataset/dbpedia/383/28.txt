Ricardo Bofill Lev√≠ ( 5 December 1939) is a Spanish architect, who, since 1963, continues to lead the international architectural and urban design practice Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura. Ricardo Bofill was born into a family of builders in 1939 in Barcelona. He studied at the Barcelona University School of Architecture and graduated from the School of Geneva. At the age of 17, Ricardo Bofill designed his first project, a summer home in Ibiza, and by 23, became lead architect of el Taller. Fifty years later, Bofill still leads Ricardo Bofill Taller de Arquitectura, with over 1000 projects to date in over 50 countries.( source: Wikipedia ). I photographed 3 of his projects during an architecture trip through France and Spain, where his name repeatedly appeared, but where I made the choice to limit myself to these projects in Paris and Montpellier.
