Abstract

We efficiently combine unpredictability and verifiability by extending the Goldreich-Goldwasser-Micali construction of pseudorandom functions fs from a secret seed s, so that knowledge of s not only enables one to evaluate fs at any point x, but also to provide an NP-proof that the value fs(x) is indeed correct without compromising the unpredictability of fs at any other point for which no such a proof was provided.

A new signature scheme without random oracles

Digital signature is commonly used for authentication of a user or data. In order to ensure the security of a signature scheme, it is important to design a signature scheme with a security proof. In 1999, Gennaro et al. and Cramer et al. respectively ...

Verifiable Random Functions: Relations to Identity-Based Key Encapsulation and New Constructions

In this paper we show a relation between the notions of verifiable random functions (VRFs) and identity-based key encapsulation mechanisms (IB-KEMs). In particular, we propose a class of IB-KEMs that we call VRF-suitable, and we propose a direct ...

Concurrently-secure credential ownership proofs

ASIACCS '07: Proceedings of the 2nd ACM symposium on Information, computer and communications security

We address the case in credential systems where a credential owner wants to show her credential to a verifier without taking the risk that the ability to prove ownership of the same (and any other) credential is transferred to the verifier. We define ...
