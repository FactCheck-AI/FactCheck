About

RSVP to secure your spot and receive event notifications! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This session is focussed on neuro symptomology surrounding "Headache" and "Collapse" and will include anatomy teaching and case presentations on neurology. We will do a recap of core knowledge from Year 1 and apply this to symptoms, investigations and treatments, allowing a deeper understanding of the clinical relevance of the anatomy of neuroscience. Tutors are Functional and Clinical Anatomy graduates who are in Year 4. Bring your anatomy booklet or any questions, and we can also help to fill in gaps and prepare you for your anatomy session on Monday/Tuesday! Look forward to seeing you there :))
