We know you're not prepared for Once Upon a Time ending, but the series finale draws ever closer â€” and we just learned that the show has officially wrapped production on its final season.

The news was confirmed by series star Jennifer Morrison, who departed the show at the end of season six but returned this spring to film scenes for the two-night series finale event airing in May.

In a message to fans, Morrison writes, "What a journey. Thank you to everyone in the cast and on the crew for making my last day so special. #emmaswan will live in my heart for ever. And I will be forever changed by #onceuponatime ... it really meant a lot to me. Cheers to spreading the magic!"

The show recently revealed that Morrison and her on-screen parents, Ginnifer Goodwin and Josh Dallas, would all be returning for the series finale along with Emilie de Ravin as Belle and a whole host of other supporting characters. Jared Gilmore will also make one last appearance as young Henry for some flashback scenes in episode 20, which is the last new episode before the two-part series finale.

There are no episode descriptions yet for the final five Once Upon a Time episodes, but we do know the titles. The final five episodes are called "The Guardian," "Flower Child," "Is This Henry Mills?", "Homecoming" and "Leaving Storybrooke." Those last three sound particularly emotional, so we're definitely stocking up on Kleenex already.
