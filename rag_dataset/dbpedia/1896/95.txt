Disney's Once Upon a Time came to an end last year, and now star Jennifer Morrison is ready to make her TV comeback.

The actress, who played Emma Swan in the fantasy adventure series, will play a "substantial" role in season four of This is Us, as reported by TVLine.

Details are scarce at the moment, but there are plenty of theories and predictions floating around. Some think she could be playing Rebecca Pearson's (Mandy Moore) sister, or perhaps a love interest for Kevin (we don't know who the mother of his son is, remember) or even Tess.

She could also play someone who knows one of the characters through work rather than a romantic interest, but we'll just have to wait and see.

Jennifer Morrison appeared in the first six seasons of Once Upon a Time before she quit the show ahead of the seventh season, although she did return for two appearances in the final run.

As the show wrapped up, the actress posted a heartfelt message to Instagram, writing: "What a journey. Thank you to everyone in the cast and on the crew for making my last day so special. Emma Swan will live in my heart forever. And I will be forever changed by Once Upon a Time.

"Thank you to Steve Pearlman for the very, very kind words at wrap today. It really meant a lot to me. Cheers to spreading the magic!"

This is Us airs on NBC in the US, and will return later this year.
