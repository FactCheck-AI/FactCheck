Once Upon a Time star Jennifer Morrison has confirmed she won't be back as a series regular in the event ABC renews the series for a seventh season.

"As I reached the end of my 6 year contract on Once Upon a Time, I was faced with a significant decision. ABC, Eddy Kitsis, and Adam Horowitz very generously invited me to continue as a series regular. After very careful consideration, I have decided that creatively and personally, it is time for me to move on," Morrison said in a post on Instagram.

While Morrison will no longer be involved as a series regular, she went on to note that she's agreed to appear as Emma Swan in one episode in the event ABC does order a Season 7, which looks likely.

Showrunners Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis released a joint statement regarding Morrison's exit, which you can read below, courtesy of Entertainment Weekly:

The past six years of collaborating with Jennifer as Emma Swan have been truly magical. Watching her breathe life into Emma, she accomplished more than we could have dreamed possible — she gave life to a brand-new Disney Princess, filled with strength and intelligence and an incredible closet full of red leather jackets. We'll miss seeing her every day, but her imprint upon Once Upon a Time is indelible. She will always be a part of the show and its heart and soul. That said, just because Jennifer won’t be back every week doesn’t mean we won’t see our savior again.

Morrison is one of four original cast members, the other three being Lana Parilla, Colin O'Donoghue and Robert Carlyle, who were invited to renew their contract. Two new members of the cast will be introduced in next week's Season 6 finale that will kick off the series' narrative reset.
