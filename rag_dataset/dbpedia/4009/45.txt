Carlisle Cathedral is one of the jewels of North West England and, after standing on the border with Scotland for almost 900 years, it has a lively story to tell.

Worship is offered here every day of the year, with sung Evensong in term time every day except Saturday. Visitors of all traditions and faiths are always welcome to join the congregation at these services. When visiting you can enjoy the beauty of the Cathedral and its precinct. There are fascinating stories of faith, hope and love to discover there.

Carlisle Cathedral has some amazing features that must be seen, such as:

The Ceiling of the Choir

The Treasury

The Bishops Throne

The East Window

The Tait Memorial Window

The Regimental Chapel

And more!

From earliest times, the Cathedral has been a source of sharing the good news of God’s love, and the advancement of learning. Christians believe mission, outreaching love; is at the heart of God’s nature and activity in the world.

Although Carlisle Cathedral is more than just a Cathedral, there’s always something on from services, to the gift shop and even music from the choirs.

So whatever your age or interest, hopefully you’ll find something in this beautiful building which will capture your imagination.
