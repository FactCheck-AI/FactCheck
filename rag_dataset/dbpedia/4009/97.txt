Carlisle Cathedral is one of the jewels of North West England and, after standing on the border with Scotland for almost 900 years, it has a lively story to tell. It may not be the best known medieval Cathedral in England, it is certainly not the biggest, but it delights its many visitors.

Worship is offered here every day of the year, with sung Evensong in term time every day except Saturday. Visitors of all traditions and faiths are always welcome to join the congregation at these services. We hope you will come to visit us and enjoy the beauty of the Cathedral and its precinct. There are fascinating stories of faith, hope and love to discover here.
