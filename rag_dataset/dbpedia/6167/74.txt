Certus Psychiatry now offers PrTMS® developed by PeakLogic® of San Diego.

This revolutionary therapy addresses brainwave “arrhythmias,” and is a non-invasive, drug-free, low grade brain stimulation treatment that may restore neuronal harmony.

PrTMS® is a drug-free alternative or addition to medication that can improve brain functioning and reduce or eliminate many symptoms associated with:

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. Personalized repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (PrTMS®) features a proprietary, patented technique that develops personalized treatment plans for each patient’s unique need.

Where traditional TMS provides magnetic pulses that stimulate activity in neurons in a specific part of the brain, PrTMS® provides recommendations for the delivery of low amplitude, non-invasive magnetic energy pulses to multiple areas of the brain, guided by in-office, painless brain mapping EEG process.

The first step of PrTMS® involves analyzing a patient’s unique brainwaves based on EEG data and constructing a map of the activity. This brain map, as seen on the right under Brain Arrythmia, is used to create a personalized patient-tailored rTMS treatment plan, which is verified and approved by Dr. Kohl.

PrTMS® allows for a dynamic approach called neuromodulation and is designed to restore balance and harmony by reducing brainwave disruptions that may contribute to a variety of conditions, as seen on the far right.

PrTMS® therapy is performed according to your custom treatment plan. During treatment, you will relax in a comfortable chair while the TMS device is positioned near your head and energy is applied. You can drive yourself to and from your appointment, and typically you will not experience many, if any side effects.
