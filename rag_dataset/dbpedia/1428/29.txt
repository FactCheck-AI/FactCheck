Inspiration: Vanille Fatale by Tom Ford.

Rich and robust. Intelligible yet enigmatic. Defiant yet understanding. Fatal Vanilla juxtaposes the desired essentials of our times while reminding us of the yin and yang that create an icon of a fragrance. Fatal Vanilla features the smooth warmness of Madagascan vanilla by contrasting it to the edgy profile of roasted coffee absolute. Velvety suede becomes interdependent with a squall of spiciness from saffron and coriander. Roasted barley offsets the familiar to create a novel olfactory event. Each twist and turn conceals a new element to be discovered. Where will Fatal Vanilla take you? Make sure to make a bottle of this new extrait de parfum yours while supplies last!
