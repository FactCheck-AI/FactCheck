A U.S. website is selling what it claims is a BMW 750iL that belonged to Tupac Shakur, for US$1.5 million.

Shakur, also known as 2Pac, was fatally shot in a BMW at the age of 25 while leaving a boxing match in Las Vegas in 1996, in a crime that has never been solved.

Memorabilia site Moments in Time is listing the BMW as “Tupac’s car - an extraordinary relic.” Several photographs of the refurbished car are displayed, with a document claiming it was registered to Shakur’s label Death Row Records in 1996. It lists the original dealer as “Nick Alexander Impor.”

Shakur was named as one of Rolling Stone magazine’s greatest artists of all time in 2010, with fellow rapper 50 Cent writing on its website: “Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac… Now that he’s not here, he’s bigger than ever.”

Shakur will be posthumously inducted to the 2017 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on April 7. Artists are eligible for inclusion 25 years from the release of their first recording.

A new BMW 7-series sedan costs from US$81,500, according to the company’s U.S. website.
