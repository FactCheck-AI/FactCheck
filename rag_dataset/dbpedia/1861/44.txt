Blepharoplasty

Blepharoplasty is a very common surgery. In simple terms, Blepharoplasty is a cosmetic surgery that alters the appearance of the eyelids. This type of surgery can be used to correct drooping upper eyelids or puffy bags under the eyes. It is important to note that Blepharoplasty is not just a vanity procedure – it can also improve vision in some cases. If you are considering this type of surgery, be sure to consult with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss your options.

Otoplasty

Otoplasty is a surgical procedure often used to correct structural abnormalities of the ear. Angular or protruding ears can be brought closer to the head, and skin defects can also be corrected. This procedure can be performed on children as young as five, and the results are usually permanent.

Rhinoplasty

Rhinoplasty, or a "nose job," is a surgical procedure to change the shape of your nose. This can be done for aesthetic reasons, or to improve breathing function. Rhinoplasty can involve changing the size and shape of the nose bone, as well as the soft tissues.

Bichectomy

Bichectomy is typically performed to correct facial asymmetry. The surgery involves making incisions in the buccal fat pads. These fat pads are located in the cheek area. The surgery is performed under general anesthesia.

MiniLifting

MiniLifting is the perfect way to refreshen your appearance without surgery or needles. It's a quick and easy procedure that can be done in the comfort of your own home.

Lipofilling

Lipofilling is a minimally invasive, minimally tissue-reactive autologous fat grafting procedure in which fat is extracted from one area of the body using gentle liposuction, purified, and then injected into another area to fill in wrinkles, lines, or creases. This innovative technique can help improve the appearance of problem areas on the face and body without the need for more drastic measures like surgery.

High Definition Lipo

High Definition Lipo is a cutting-edge cosmetic procedure that can help you achieve the perfectly sculpted body you've always wanted. High Definition Lipo uses state-of-the-art technology to target and remove unwanted fat cells from specific areas of the body. By targeting problem areas and providing targeted sculpting and contouring, High Definition Lipo can give you the results you desire with minimal downtime.

Breast Surgery

Many women choose to have breast surgery to improve their appearance. Breast surgery can be used to augment the bust or reduce its size.
