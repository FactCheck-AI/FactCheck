Things are set to get spooky this week as ghosts, zombies and evil creatures invade the Wii Shop Channel and Nintendo DSi Shop! You'll need nerves of steel to negotiate your way cleverly through a haunted high school in the horror puzzle game LIT, and fearless families can band together to drive the ghosts from Fazzy's mansion in Ghost Mansion Party, both on WiiWare this week.

And that's not all! Hordes of the undead and other hideous creatures are attacking the neighbourhood in the Super Nintendo classic Zombies on Virtual Console. And on Nintendo DSiWare a famous fairy tale gets an unexpected twist in supernatural shooter Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ!
