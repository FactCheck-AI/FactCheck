Londa Schiebinger is the John L. Hinds Professor of History of Science at Stanford University. She currently directs the EU/US Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment project. She is a leading international expert on gender in science and technology. Over the past thirty years, Schiebingerâs work has been devoted to teasing apart three analytically distinct but interlocking pieces of the gender and science puzzle: the history of womenâs participation in science; the structure of scientific institutions; and the gendering of human knowledge. She is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Schiebinger addressed the United Nations on the topic of âGender, Science, and Technologyâ in 2011 and again in 2014. She is the recipient of numerous prizes and awards, including the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize and Guggenheim Fellowship.

Her prize-winning books include: The Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science (Harvard University Press, 1989); Natureâs Body: Gender in the Making of Modern Science (Beacon Press, 1993; Rutgers University Press, 2004); Has Feminism Changed Science? (Harvard University Press, 1999); Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World (Harvard University Press, 2004); Gendered Innovations: How Gender Analysis Contributes to Research (European Commission, 2013); with Claudia Swan, Colonial Botany: Science, Commerce, and Politics in the Early Modern World (University of Pennsylvania, 2005), and with Robert N. Proctor, Agnotology: The Making and Unmaking of Ignorance (Stanford University Press, 2008). She is also author of Dual Career Couples: What Universities Need to Know (with Andrea Davies and Shannon Gilmartin). These and other of her books have been translated into numerous languages.
