The Godfather: Part II traces two generations of crime starting with the beginning of a gangster family in Sicily and early 1920s New York life of a young “godfather” Vito Corleone (played by Robert de Niro). It also focuses on his son Michael’s (Al Pacino) budding life of crime as he takes control over their crime syndicate stretching from Nevada to Cuba in the late 1950s. The Godfather films set the tone for a new wave of gangster films and this one is rightly considered an American classic; oh, and quite possibly cinema’s greatest sequel.
