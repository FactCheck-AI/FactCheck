Fraternities and sororities play an important role both on campus and throughout the community. Scholarship, service, friendship, brotherhood/sisterhood are the common principles founded by each of our Greek lettered organizations.

There are 14 Interfraternity Council, or IFC, fraternities at the University of Arkansas including Alpha Gamma Rho, Beta Theta Pi, Farmhouse, Kappa Alpha Order, Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha, Sigma Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Pi, and Sigma Nu.

We have eleven Panhellenic sororities here at the U of A, they are Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Delta Pi, Alpha Omicron Pi, Chi Omega, Delta Delta Delta, Delta Gamma, Kappa Delta, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Phi Mu, Pi Beta Phi, and Zeta Tau Alpha. Panhellenic Greek life is expanding; Delta Gamma is coming to campus Fall 2016 and Alpha Gamma Delta is expected to come Fall 2017.

The National Pan-Hellenic Council is composed of the nine historically black fraternities and sororities: Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc., Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc., Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc., Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., and Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.

Our United Greek Council includes Alpha Lambda Chapter of Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity Inc., a Latino fraternity, and Hermandad de Sigma Iota Alpha Inc., a Latina sorority.

Being involved in a Greek organization will provide many opportunities for your student to participate in activities that will enhance their personal development, promote academics, and advance their leadership skills. No matter what council your student decides to join, they will certainly find a welcoming community!
