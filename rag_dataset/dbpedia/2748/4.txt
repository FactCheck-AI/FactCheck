Generation No. 2

2. CHRISTIAN2 HOFFMAN (ANDREAS1) was born 1796 in Krolikow, Poland (see note), and died 12 May 1879 in Romansdorf (Grunwald), Kiev, Russia2. He married ANNA ROSINE HAHN 18 Feb 1819 in Stanislawow Holendry near Rawa, Poland3, daughter of SAMUEL HAHN and ANNA HEYN. She was born 1799 in Nekla, Poland then in Prussia (see note)3, and died 01 Dec 1870 in Romansdorf, Kiev, Russia4.

Notes for CHRISTIAN HOFFMAN:

As per Eric's Hoffman Family History, the Hoffman Family Patriarch Christian Hoffman was born in 1796 in Gorditz (or Grevitz), Silesia according to the Lutheran Church of Romansdorf, Kiev, Russia's record of Christian's 1879 death. Christian Hoffman's son Samuel Hoffman was born in 1832 in Stanislowow near Rawa, Poland (which is not far from Lodz, Poland) according to the record of his 1878 death at age 46 preserved in the Lutheran Church records of Romansdorf, Kiev, Russia. The church records of Volhynia tell us that Christian was married to Anna Rosine (nee Hahn)

There have been many areas of Germany referred to as Saxony. Our Hoffman's Saxony is located along the southern part of German/Poland border; Saxony contains the cities of Dresden and Leipzig. In this smallish state, Martin Luther lived, taught, and instigated the Reformation. Saxony became a bastion of God fearing, hard working Germans (like our Hoffmans - and the many other Hoffmans in Saxony). But the land was poor so perhaps the Hoffmans moved to Poland to obtain better farm land.

Not long after Christian's birth, Napoleon invaded Germany and Saxony became a tributory state. Men were drafted from Saxony for the army of Napoleon. Perhaps the Hoffmans left Saxony for Poland in the midst of the political turmoil or to avoid the draft.

Christian's birth place was established by looking at the copies of the Rawa Court records where he on 9 Feb 1819 had witnesses state that they knew him and that he resident in the Stanislowow. This had to be done after one moved into a new administrative district in Poland. These records were in the local archives and have not been filmed by the Mormons.

Or the Hoffmans may have left for economic reasons. After a lot of Poland was incorporated into Russia in 1792 by Catherine the Great, merchants in the Lodz, Poland area begin to recruit cloth makers from Silesia and weavers from Saxony to make their products in cottage industries in and around Lodz. Since Lodz was now inside Russia those products would be duty-free unlike cloth from Germany (Albert Bryer, The German Settlements in Central Poland, 1935 reprinted in Wandering Volhynians 1991, 4(4)). This could explain the Hoffman's move from Saxony to the Lodz area assuming they were weavers or cloth makers from Saxony. (See the appendix for Eric's description of cloth making.)

Then the Hoffmans moved onward to Volhynia. In the Pastor's Notes of mid-September 1835 for Friedensdorf, Volhynia, we find this listing for the apparently newly arrived Christian Hoffman Family: "Christian Hoffman 38 with wife Anna Rosine 37 and Daniel 14(?), Gottfried Friedrich 10, Anna Helena 8, Anna Rosine 5 and Samuel 3." Samuel's birth record and the above Pastor's note tell us that the Christian Hoffman family was in Poland in 1832 and that they left Poland no later than 1835. Also Christian and Anna Rosine must have been married no later than 1821 (assuming they were Lutherans of the old school). The first record a child of theirs being born in Russia is that of Caroline Hoffman born May 05, 1836 in Justinowka, Volhynia, Russia. Justinowka is near Friedensdorf, their initial arrival point.

That arrival date tells us Christian was one of the earliest Germans in Volhynia, Russia since the major migrations there occurred after the major Polish uprising of 1863. But why did he go from Saxony to Poland and then onward to Volhynia?

There was a major Polish rebellion in 1832. The Russians crushed the rebellion but Germans felt unsafe. As a punishment for the revolution, cloth made in Poland was no longer duty-free when sold in Russia; thus, a lot of jobs were in jeopardy. Meanwhile, Volhynian noblemen wished to set up cloth making industries on their lands and invited the cloth makers and weavers from the Lodz area. Thus, the Hoffmans may have been home-based cloth makers that moved to Volhynia for economic and safety reasons.

It is not clear when or why the Hoffman's moved from Volhynia, Russia to Romansdorf (the slavic name is Doliwa), in Kiev Parish, Russia in 1855. Perhaps, as the families of the villagers like the Hoffmans grew, they may have needed to move to where more land was available. Also in 1845 Christian's son Daniel married Henriette Gitzmann who was born near Kiev. This gave the Hoffmans good knowledge of and contacts in the Kiev area. Also Eric Hoffman notes the land around Romansdorf was excellent for farming so it might have just been the quality of the land.

Eric and other often talk about places like Grunwald (Dubrowa/Dibrova) and Ludwigsdorf. These were villages near Romansdorf and Romansdorf was often used on the church records for those living in the nearby villages.

Notes for ANNA ROSINE HAHN:

Rosine's family name is Hahn (hen in German). In the Czerniewice Catholic Church Book records her family name was listed as Kurowski (Polish hen Kura plus owski).

Anna Rosine's birth place was established by looking at the copies of the Rawa Court records where she on 9 Feb 1819 had witnesses state that they knew her and that she resident in the Stanislowow. This had to be done after one moved into a new administrative district in Poland. These records were in the local archives and have not been filmed by the Mormons.

Notes for JONATHAN SPRINGER:

Artur Pohl notes, "Julianne Gesswein married Jonathan Springer. They had a daughter, Adina. Nothing is known about more kids. Adina, born in 1901 in Gruenwald, Ukraine, apparently married August, the brother of her mother. They had one daughter, Olga, who got lost during WWII. Olga was born in 1924 and is missed since the deportations of Germans of the Warthegau (Poland) in 1939 or 1940. Adina escaped the Red Army and lived with the daughter of Samuel Gesswein, Lydia Gesswein-Herold in West-Germany, where she died in 1973."

Springer may well be Johan Ludwig Spranger born 13 nov 1867 to Carl Ludwig Spranger and his wife Pauline Krenke in Kiev.

Notes for R

UDOLPH PODJAN:

Phone call with Isabelle Podjan 1/1/1

Apparently Roy was born in Altona MB and went down to Benton Harbor in the twenties. His friends from MB the Arndt brothers were there and introduced him to Olga. They were married and lived the rest of their lives in Benton Harbor.

Roy's father and mother migrated directly from Germany (not Russia) to MB on the same boat as August Remus - the Polynesian. And possibly on the same date.

Notes for A

GNES DOROTHEA LEHMAN:

For future use, if you are interested (this isn't really your family but just to set the record straight), Agnes D. Lehman Kraft died October 14, 2001 (age 94 1/2) in Houston, Texas. She and Paul were not married at St. Paul's Lutheran church -- they were married secretly by a Baptist minister in DeWitt, AR (your date was correct). Mother had helped her mother put on those big 3-day weddings they used to have and since she was the youngest girl, she wanted no part of all that work anymore. She and Dad were married for 6-mos before they told anyone. That allowed them to gather money together to buy furniture, etc. to start housekkeeping. from descendent Gerry Barbeau <r-gbarbo@worldnet.att.net>
