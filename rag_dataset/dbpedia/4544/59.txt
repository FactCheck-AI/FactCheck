Little Island's The Oyster Radio Hour has added some Broadway talent to its cast list, namely Amber Gray and Amber Iman.

Both will be part of the live, three-act radio show, a family-friendly affair that will celebrate the resilience of oysters and their ecological importance. Performances run July 31–August 4, all at 8 PM. Keenan Tyler Oliphant is directing the show, which is written by Miller & Harlow. The performance features audio interviews with Dr. Matthew Hare, Elliott Ma, Ayasha Guerin, Moody Harney, and Alan Michelson.

But the oyster fun doesn't stop with the performance. During the run, visit Little Island's Play Ground 6:30-10 PM to find a bespoke oyster market, which will offer food and beverages curated by New Amsterdam Market founder Robert LaValva. Visitors can see live oyster shucking and sample oysters from 10 local vendors, all designed to pair perfectly with the live performance.

The Oyster Radio Hour is a collaboration between RR Sigel, Ana González, Angélica Negrón, and Mark Sonnenblick. The performance is being given in partnership with Yo-Yo Ma's Our Common Nature.

Tony honoree Jason Michael Webb is music directing and has penned arrangements, with the music team also including Negrón on water synth and accordion, Matt Evans on percussion, and Darian Donovan Thomas on electric violin and fiddle. The production will also feature lighting and video design by Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew and sound design by Beth Lake. Beatrice Perez-Arche is stage managing.
