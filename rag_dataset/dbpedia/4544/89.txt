Newly released production shots offer a first look at Little Island's The Oyster Radio Hour, performing through August 4. Take a look at the production in the gallery below.

Host Susan Sarandon seems to have channeled another theatrical culinary artist, Mrs. Lovett, as she leads the celebration of all things oysters. The cast also includes Broadway favorites Amber Gray and Amber Iman.

The family-friendly performance is presented as a three-act radio show, celebrating the resilience of oysters and their ecological importance. Keenan Tyler Oliphant is directing the show, which is written by Miller & Harlow. The performance features audio interviews with Dr. Matthew Hare, Elliot Ma, Ayasha Guerin, Moody Harney, and Alan Michelson.

But the oyster fun doesn't stop with the performance. During the run, visit Little Island's Play Ground 6:30-10 PM to find a bespoke oyster market, which features food and beverages curated by New Amsterdam Market founder Robert LaValva. Visitors can see live oyster shucking and sample oysters from 10 local vendors, all designed to pair perfectly with the live performance.

The Oyster Radio Hour is a collaboration between RR Sigel, Ana González, Angélica Negrón, and Mark Sonnenblick. The performance is being given in partnership with Yo-Yo Ma's Our Common Nature.

Tony honoree Jason Michael Webb is music directing and has penned arrangements, with the music team also including Negrón on water synth and accordion, Matt Evans on percussion, and Darian Donovan Thomas on electric violin and fiddle. The production also has lighting and video design by Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew and sound design by Beth Lake. Beatrice Perez-Arche is stage managing.
