When Queen Victoria, the Empress of British India, passed away in 1901, the then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, suggested the construction of a grand memorial in her honour. Its foundation was laid in 1906 by the Prince of Charles, who later became King George V, and the building was formally opened to the public in 1921.

Victoria Memorial showcases Indo-Saracenic revivalist architectural style with clear Mughal, Egyptian, Islamic, Venetian, Deccani and British elements. Made of gorgeous white Markana marble, the structure soars to 56 metres.
