Why Republic titled this "Zorro's Black Whip" is a mystery except perhaps for name recognition. The studio did produce several Zorro serials. There is nothing Zorro here. Name is never mentioned and setting is Idaho not California. The black garbed hero is known as "The Black Whip." There is a gender bender as Linda Stirling is quickly revealed the Black Whip. The heavy lifting (meaning fisticuffs and shooting) is performed by top billed George J. Lewis as an undercover federal agent.

Cast is packed with familiar faces from Republic's stock company of character actors and stuntmen. Locations are those same distinct rock formations at the Simi Valley movie ranch that Republic used over and over. Western fans will recognize those well worn trails and even the cave. Solidly made entertaining serial as you would expect from Republic.
