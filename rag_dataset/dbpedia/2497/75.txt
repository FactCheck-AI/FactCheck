Today, Wednesday October 21, Álvaro Morte will premiere one of his first main roles away from the show which granted him international acclaim.

Morte will star as Ramón as part of a group of scientists in Antarctica in new Spanish thriller, The Head.

Created and co-written by David Pastor, Àlex Pastor and David Troncoso, the six-episode series follows a small expedition known as ‘the Winterers’, who continue their studies in the South Pole throughout its bleak, six-month winter.

The ten-strong team carry out innovative tests at the Polaris VI Antarctic Research Station, conducting crucial research for the fight against climate change.

Morte will also feature alongside Rosamund Pike in a major role for Amazon’s Wheel of Time series, based on Robert Jordan’s sprawling fantasy work.

He is set to portray Logan Ablar, and is expected to play a pivotal part in the epic saga as the adaptation continues.

While Money Heist is hurtling towards its devastating conclusion next year, this is by no means the end of Álvaro Morte’s time in the spotlight.

Money Heist season 4 is available to stream on Netflix.
