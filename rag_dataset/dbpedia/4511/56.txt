In the early 2000s, a new wave of bands emerged in the UK that drew inspiration from the post-punk sound of the late 70s and early 80s. This genre, known as UK post-punk revival, features angular guitar riffs, driving rhythms, and introspective lyrics. Bands like Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines, and Arctic Monkeys are considered key players in this movement.
