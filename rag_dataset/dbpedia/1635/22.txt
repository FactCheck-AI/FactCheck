Description: A single player mappack/mod for HalfLife featuring the Daleks from the cult TV show Doctor Who.

Story: You are assigned to investigate a situation taking place in a junk yard in Totters Lane, London. It is believed that a small group of militia are held up in this area, possibly protecting some form of transmat device which is to be used as a launch pad for a planned invasion. It is hoped that you can infiltrate the junk yard, use the transmat to board an orbiting battleship and finally destroy it.
