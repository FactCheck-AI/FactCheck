History & History Related Items

Lompoc is well-known for flower seed growing.

Lompoc is pronounced as "Lom-Poke". Not "Lom-Pock". The establishment of La Purisima Mission brought the first European settlers to the Lompoc Valley. But the very first known settlers were the Chumash Indians. Lompoc is a Chumash word which means little lake or lagoon. Lompoc was incorporated as a city on August 13, 1888. The city was once a temperance colony in the 19th century. There are many stories surrounding that period of time. The city was also mainly an agricultural one. As time went on, the economy began to grow as did the city. One of the main factors in Lompoc growing economically and becoming so diversified is that Camp Cooke was established. Camp Cooke is now known as Vandenberg Air Force Base.
