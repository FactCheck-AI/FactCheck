Amanda Solloway MP is the new Minister for Intellectual Property (IP), in a more focused portfolio than previous incumbents.

Ms Solloway, the MP for Derby North, takes up the IP role as part of her portfolio as the new Minister for Science, Research and Innovation

Since 2016 IP has been part of the Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation’s responsibilities. The latest government reshuffle has seen universities split off leaving science, research and innovation.

Tania Clark, President of CITMA, said: “A Minister for IP with a more focused portfolio will be beneficial to the profession. 2020 will be crucial for the future of IP in the UK, therefore it is important to have someone who can work closely with the IP professions to tackle the challenges we face.

“We are looking forward to working with Ms Solloway. It is vital that full consideration is given to IP during trade negotiations between the UK and EU and will we be impressing on her the importance of IP in supporting business and innovation.”

Ms Solloway is the tenth Minister for IP in as many years.
