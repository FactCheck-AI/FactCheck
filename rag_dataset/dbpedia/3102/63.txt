First appearing as a novel by Patrick Dennis in 1955, then adapted for the stage, Morton DaCosta’s Auntie Mame follows an orphan in the care of his vivacious and free-wheeling aunt, Mame, portrayed by Rosalind Russell. The rollicking comedy flows with Mame’s ethos that “life is a banquet,” even as mid-century class and social norms seek to tamp down her uproarious energy.
