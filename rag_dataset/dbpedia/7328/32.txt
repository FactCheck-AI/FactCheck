Answer:

The Aspect button allows you to change the shape of the television image depending on the format of the received signal, and your viewing performance.

For example, standard analog (4:3) images with black side bars can be stretched to fill your TV's wide (16:9) aspect. However, high definition signals (720P/1080i) which originated as 4:3 images with side bars and are up-converted by broadcaster to 16:9 can not be changed on some models.

The following models employ a new "H-FILL" mode or "4:3 Full" mode which allows you to change the aspect on high definition signals (720P/1080i). Please contact the shop you purchase or the Global Service Center Network for further information.
