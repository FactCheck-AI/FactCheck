"Girlfriend"

[Omarion singing:]

I've got everything I want in my life except a girlfreind

[Verse1]

Just copped a Bently and it's parked in my garage

A two o'clock appointment for my massage

And everywhere we go they know just who we are

There they go it's them ghetto superstars

The latet grow backs are the ones on my feet

Get off the Benz and them I'm off up in the Jeep

Take ya fix with chicks that look like Licia Keys

All of that I'm still missin' one thing

[Chorus:]

A Girlfriend, Girlfriend

I need a girlfriend, girlfriend

A girlfriend, girlfriend

Would you be my girlfriend, Girlfriend

[Verse 2]

We hit the mall buyin' up all the Nike suits

I'm being pebbled while I'm chillin by the pool

From the shore to the limo to the club

Hands in the air showin' nothin' but some love

Got plenty clothes, plenty ice plenty cash

A pretty swope plenty abs plenty shhh

I got every single thing that I need

Except for a main squeeze

[Chorus:]

A Girlfriend, Girlfriend

I need a girlfriend, girlfriend

A girlfriend, girlfriend

Would you be my girlfriend, Girlfriend

[Hook:]

Alright Alright

We got B2K up in this piece

(Tell me who's gonna be my girlfriend)

And we need all the ladies out there lookin' for a nice fella to get up out yo seat c'mon!

(And who I bet needs a real man)

Put yall hand up Put yall hands up

(And who's gonna ride or die with me)

Yeah who's gonna be that ride or die chick for me tonight

(Who's gonna give B2K what they need)

[Fizz's Rap:]

I need a thick with big hips that's just my motivation

No more game preperation, This is pimperation

She must be ready and steady for a romance session

I'm talkin' willin' to learn, A Lil Fizz lesson

Now she playin' at it again and now we arguin'

Talkin' girls talk mess and tellin' all her friends

When I seen this new chick tonight

"WHY I LOVE YOU"

LYRICS

From day one you and I've been friends.

Hangin out, havin fun, chillin.

Now I know at times I got crazy, silly ways and actin shady.

You peep things in me no one sees.

You hold it down fo shizzy.

Now I have friends I thought were true but no one more true

than you.

So what am I gonna do.

It took a while for me to see how special you treated me.

Maybe thats the reason why I love you.

You're my heart girl.

And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here.

No one else can make me feel like you do.

You've shared my world.

Baby that's the reason why I love you.

No other girl is quite like you.

And no one has my back like you do.

Girl you're one of a kind, and you blow my mind.

And I'm glad to say you're mine.

Girl you're the one that changed me from a boy into a man.

Maybe that's the reason why I love you.

Your my heart girl.

And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here.

No one else can make me feel like you do.

You've shared my world.

Baby that's the reason why I love you.

It took a while for me to see how you treated me.

Maybe that's the reason why I love you.

You're my heart girl.

And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here.

No one else can make me feel like you do.

You've shared my world.

Baby that's the reason why I love you.

Maybe that's the reason why I love you.

You're my heart girl.

And wit all the crazy things that I do, you're still here.

No one else can make me feel like you do.

You've shared my world.

Baby that's the reason why I love you.
