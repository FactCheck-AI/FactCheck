REFLECTIONS FROM ATHENA

Dear Corps Members, Alumni, Students, Families, Partners, Supporters, and Staff,

It’s incredible to think back to that blisteringly hot summer day when Teach For America – Memphis officially

launched in June 2006. We began with 48 charter corps members, a handful of local alumni, and a staff of four.

We had been welcomed to this community by bold, visionary folks like then Memphis City Schools’ superintendent

Dr. Carol Johnson, and local philanthropists Barbara and Pitt Hyde. While there may have been little momentum

city-wide for education at the time, this daring and forward-thinking collective was committed to proving what we

already believed to be true: students in low-income schools across Memphis can achieve at high academic levels

and will flourish when given the opportunities they deserve to attain happiness and success in life.

Fast forward to today, when nearly 300 corps members are following in the footsteps of the 1,500 Teach For

America alumni who have contributed to improving public education in Memphis over the past ten years. Not only

have we inspired hundreds of talented individuals to commit to careers in the classroom, we now count 23 school

leaders and 4 school system leaders among our local alumni. More than 80% of our local alumni work full-time in

education. Many others continue to advocate for equity as they pursue careers in law, healthcare, and business.

Several have even started their own organizations to serve our students’ needs directly. Though a disparity in

academic achievement persists between students in our city’s low-income communities and those with greater

advantages, Memphis was nationally recognized in a study that found that, between 2011 and 2014, the city had

closed this gap by nearly 20 percent1. Memphis students now have multiple educational options including Shelby

County Schools, the Achievement School District, and the expanding constellation of charter schools across the

region. Shelby County Schools has been recognized across the country for its progressive approach to improving

educational outcomes for all students thanks to the creation of its Innovation Zone (iZone) schools. Freedom

Preparatory Academy’s first class of sixth-graders just graduated high school, and the Soulsville Charter School

has boasted a 100% college acceptance rate for graduating seniors since it was founded in 2005. These are just

some of the stories that make us proud of our role in recruiting, training, and developing incredible leaders who

have helped so many local institutions accomplish so much in the past decade.

As we reflect on all that Teach For America has helped contribute to the dramatic improvements not just in

Memphis, but in the state of Tennessee, we’re humbled by our integral role and even more determined to see

these efforts through to fruition. We invite you to join us in celebrating what you have helped make possible and

hope you enjoy reading our “Decade in Review”.

One day, all kids in Memphis will have the opportunity to attain an excellent education. We could not have come

this far without your support and commitment, and we are counting on you to continue the fight for educational

equity.

With gratitude,

STARTING STRONG

Beginning with our charter corps in 2006, TFA corps members have helped Memphis emerge as one of the most

progressive and collaborative public education landscapes in the country. Our earliest years in this community

focused on proving what could be possible for kids when the energy, talent, and determination of exceptional

leaders was nurtured and unleashed.

GROWING THE MOVEMENT

GROWING THE MOVEMENT FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY

During our initial years of remarkable progress in classrooms across the city, corps members showed how much

students in low-income communities could achieve when led by adults who believed deeply in their potential and

held a high bar for academic excellence no matter how challenging the circumstances. Given these undeniable

results, the local demand for corps members dramatically increased. Teach For America responded with greater

numbers of increasingly diverse talent, and we aspired to replicate our early success in as many classrooms

across the city as possible. At this moment in time, our charge was clear: scale up to build an unstoppable force

of leaders oriented toward educational equity, and do it as quickly as possible!

WE GRIND HERE

Our local movement evolved as the education environment in Memphis became increasingly oriented toward

both excellence and equity for all kids. While it was clear that academic achievement would remain critical to our

students’ success, we also knew strong test scores and high-performing classrooms were not enough to truly

transform educational outcomes in low-income communities. Understanding that the path to a different reality

would require the concerted effort of a broad and diverse coalition, we evolved our program to encompass the

skills required to build just that. We placed an even greater emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion across

our programming spectrum. We prioritized building our corps members’ cultural competence and engaged them

more deeply in the way racism, classism, and privilege have shaped our society. We pushed them to reflect on how

their identities impact the way they experience the world and heightened their awareness of how they interact

with others. This shift has greatly strengthened our corps members’ ability to build deep relationships with their

students, various stakeholders in their students’ lives, Teach For America staff, and each other.

In 2013, after years of sending our incoming corps Beyond the classroom,

CORPS MEMBERS

Over the past decade, Teach For America - Memphis has welcomed

over 30 second-generation corps members, who are Teach For

America corps members that were taught by corps members

themselves growing up. While there are many factors that led

these new teachers to the classroom, some specifically point

to their relationship with a Teach For America teacher as their

inspiration to pursue careers in education.

FOCUSED ON THE FUTURE

Teach For America has become a critical source of diverse leaders who are helping rewrite the narrative about

educational excellence and equity in Memphis. We recognize that, in addition to excellent academic results and

cultural competence, success in the 21st century requires a sophisticated understanding of our increasingly

complex world. For this reason, we are shifting our program in important ways. While we’ve always disrupted

the status quo in the interest of kids, our alumni and corps members continue to grow and refuse to become

complacent. We’re focused on ensuring that our schools and systems are set up to support students entering a

digital, global economy through personalized learning, creativity, critical thinking, and language acquisition. All

kids in Memphis deserve the opportunity to pursue their dreams and realize their potential, and Teach For America

develops the kind of leaders who will help them chart a course toward a more promising future.

The 2016 corps heralded the tenth anniversary of our operation in Memphis. Now in their second year, they will

soon join the ranks of the outstanding alumni who have come before them. Also teaching this year is Emily Abeles,

a member of our charter corps who has chosen to remain in the classroom since 2006.

Emily Abeles (Memphis ‘06) began her journey In an address to the 2016 corps at the conclusion

After coming to Tennessee to help found the Achievement

role as superintendent. Building upon his legacy as its founding

leader, the state of Tennessee continues to pursue its ambitious

plan to dramatically improve outcomes for children in schools

OUR HOME AT CROSSTOWN

Teach For America kicked off the 2017-2018 school year by joining

the diverse array of local organizations and businesses located at

Crosstown Concourse. Our new Self + Tucker designed space promotes

community and collaboration in a welcoming environment reflective of

our core values, commitment to diversity, and Memphis pride. Featuring

original murals by Jamond Bullock, 45% of our budget for this move

was contracted with MWBE businesses, the highest proportion for any

tenant in the building. Our office was intentionally designed to serve

as a home base to facilitate collaboration among all of our participants
