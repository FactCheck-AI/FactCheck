We have compiled a complete list of new marine molluscan taxa introduced by Tommaso Allery Di Maria, Marquis of Monterosato (1841–1927). The dates of publication of every single work have been checked against available evidence, and an updated bibliography is also presented. Finally, the type material of all marine taxa expected to be in the collection Monterosato (presently preserved in the Museo Civico di Zoologia in Rome) has been searched in the main collection, and all retrieved specimens have been catalogued. A large majority of the material has been found, representative specimens of each taxon have been illustrated, and remarks on nomenclature and taxonomy have been provided yielding 42 new synonymies, 46 nominal taxa rediscovered, and 6 new combinations.

Some taxonomically troublesome nominal taxa of the rissoid genus Alvania Risso, 1826 are examined: Alvania disparilis Monterosato, 1890, A. peloritana (Aradas & Benoit, 1874), A. perversa F. Nordsieck, 1972 and A. dorbignyi (Audouin, 1826). The four species are here considered as valid, and for the sake of nomenclatural stability lectotypes of Alvania disparilis, Rissoa peloritana and Alvania perversa are designated. The holotype of Alvania dorbignyi is refigured and redescribed, and all Mediterranean records of this species are reassigned to A. perversa. Alvania schwartziana Brusina, 1866 is reported for the first time in Italian waters. Three new species are herein described: Alvania bartolinorum n. sp., Alvania unica n. sp. and Alvania zaraensis n. sp.

Herein we revise several Recent Mediterranean species of the rissoid genus Alvania Risso, 1826: Alvania scabra (Philippi, 1844), Alvania sculptilis (Monterosato, 1877), Alvania sororcula Granata-Grillo, 1877, Alvania lucinae Oberling, 1970, Alvania josefoi Oliver & Templado, 2009 and Alvania scuderii Villari, 2017. They represent a rather homogeneous group of morphologically similar species, referred to as the Alvania scabra complex, which includes also some other species from the northeastern Atlantic. We designate a neotype for Rissoa scabra Philippi, 1844 and a lectotype for Rissoa oranica Pallary, 1900 to stabilize the use of the names. Alvania oranica (Pallary, 1900) is confirmed as a synonym of Alvania scabra (Philippi, 1844), and Alvania asperella (Granata-Grillo, 1877) is proposed as a synonym of Alvania sororcula (Granata-Grillo, 1877) [new synonymy]. Finally, we describe one new Mediterranean species: Alvania pizzinii Amati, Smriglio & Oliverio n. sp. from Levanzo Is., Sicily.
