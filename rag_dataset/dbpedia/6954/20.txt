9 Jun â€“ It was reported that the wife of former Choc7 member, Xiao Ma had recently committed suicide after finding out about the Taiwanese singer's extramarital affair.

As reported on Groove Asia website, the heartbroken wife, Ye Ling Han committed suicide by jumping off a building in Macau, just slightly after a quarrel with Xiao Ma regarding his affair.

Sources claimed that the singer has been involved in an extramarital affair with a colleague since a year ago while his wife was still pregnant.

Xiao Ma, who has been keeping low profile ever since the news of her suicide broke out, finally showed up at the Macau airport recently to send his wife's body back to Taiwan.

When asked by reporters regarding the suicide, Xiao Ma, who was looking haggard, expressed, "I just wish to settle my wife's funeral properly. Thanks everyone for your concern."

Meanwhile, Ling Han's family demands an apology from the third party who has yet to appear in public, and added that they are unable to forgive Xiao Ma and the third party for causing Ling Han's death.

Ling Han's former boss who turned up at the funeral to pay his last respects stated, "Ling Han was seeking advice from her colleagues from the legal department one day before her suicide. She wanted to hire a private investigator to expose her husband's extramarital affair and catch them in the act."

The former Choc7 member had a shotgun marriage with his late wife last year due to her pregnancy. The couple moved to Macau when Xiao was hired to work as a public relations officer at the Sands Macao Hotel and gave birth to their daughter the same year.
