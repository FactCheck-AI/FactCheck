Tributes are pouring in for Sunrise Radio’s founder Avtar Lit who was pronounced dead this morning.

The news was announced via a statement from his family this morning.

Avtar Lit, who initiated Britain’s first full-time Asian radio station, Sunrise Radio, departed from this world on 27 June at the age of 73, leaving behind a rich legacy and countless memories that will continue to resonate for generations to come.

Avtar launched Sunrise Radio in 1989, the first 24-hour independent commercial Asian radio station.

In July 2013, Lit was one of the forty radio professionals honoured by the Radio Centre for their significant contribution to the growth and success of the industry.

A statement released by Sunrise Radio said, “On behalf of the Lit family, it is with deep sorrow that we inform you of the passing of the radio and broadcasting pioneer Avtar Singh Lit.”

Broadcaster and journalist Anila Dhami paid tribute to the late founder:

“Sad news. Avtar Lit was a pioneer for Asian media in Britain. When I was starting out, he believed in me and got me training”.

Avtar Lit touched many hearts during his lifetime and will be remembered for his efforts he invested to make radio broadcast a successful medium.
