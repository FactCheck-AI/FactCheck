Barcelona will wear the logo of international pop star Rosalía on their shirts for el Clásico this weekend.

Sunday’s meeting with Real Madrid at the Camp Nou sees the current LaLiga leaders bidding to extend a nine-point advantage over their arch-rivals.

As part of their multi-year sponsorship deal with Spotify, Xavi Hernández’s side are set to step out with the ‘Motomami’ logo of Rosalía, who hails from Catalonia, adorning their shirt.

Barça previously wore the logo of rapper Drake’s OVO Sound Label in October’s 3-1 defeat at the Santiago Bernabéu to commemorate him becoming the first musician to surpass 50 million streams on Spotify.
