Nick Boles is to continue to serve as Skills Minister, Prime Minister David Cameron has announced.

The newly-re-elected MP for Grantham and Stamford was called to Number 10 Downing Street a short while ago and joked with journalists on his way in.

Mr Boles took over as Skills Minister last July when the previous minister Matthew Hancock was promoted to attend cabinet as a business and energy minister.

The role will continue to be split between the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Department for Education and will include additional responsibilities for trade union and employment law.

Mr Hancock has now been appointed as Minister for the Cabinet Office, and will take charge of civil service reform.

It was confirmed earlier that Nicky Morgan will continue her work as Education Secretary and Sajid Javid will take on the role of Business Secretary in Mr Cameron’s majority Conservative government.

Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna and Shadow Education Secretary Tristram Hunt remain in their jobs following a partial reshuffle of the shadow cabinet by acting Labour leader Harriet Harman.
