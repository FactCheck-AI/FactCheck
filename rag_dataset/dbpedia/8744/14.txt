Britain’s minister for culture, communications and creative industries Ed Vaizey is the latest to leave the government as new prime minister Theresa May, of the Conservative Party, continues to reshuffle the cabinet after taking over from David Cameron.

Matthew Hancock is replacing Vaizey, it was revealed Monday. Hancock was paymaster general, the minister at the head of the treasury department responsible for payments, and has been one of the key people working on the potential privatization of U.K. broadcaster Channel 4.

Last week, May named Karen Bradley secretary of state for culture, media and sport. In her new role, she has overall responsibility for the work of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport and the digital economy.

In his new minister of state role, Hancock will oversee broadband, spectrum and telecoms, as well as culture and heritage issues, in addition to the internet and creative industries, libraries, media and museums and galleries.

In a reference to the Brexit, his departure and his last name, Vaizey tweeted: “Looking forward to supporting the government from the backbenches #vexit.”

Hancock tweeted: “Sad to see #Vexit – big tributes to my friend @edvaizey’s amazing work over 6 years to build UK as tech & cultural leader.”
