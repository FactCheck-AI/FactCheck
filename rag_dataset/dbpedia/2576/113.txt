UFC, meet D.U.S.T.

Viral sensation Commander Dale Brown, founder of Detroit Urban Survival Training (D.U.S.T), will bring his expertise to the cage Saturday. UFC middleweight Joaquin Buckley has enlisted Brown as a cornerman for his UFC Fight Night 201 bout at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, he confirmed in an Instagram post Thursday after an initial report by TMZ.

Brown became increasingly popular over the past year for his “survival” videos in which he quickly escapes out of simulated life-threatening situations using unusual maneuvers with relative ease. A subject of numerous memes and spoof videos, Brown hosted Buckley at D.U.S.T. headquarters earlier this year.

According to the official Detroit D.U.S.T. website, Brown “used his knowledge of martial arts, firearms training from the military as an Airborne Paratrooper, and experience as a private investigator to create a modern survival tactical training system” and has taught it to others since 1994.

The system is described as a blend of “Kyokushin, Japanese Karate, Hapkido Korean Karate, Aikido Japanese Martial Art, Japanese Jujutsu, Japanese Judo, JKD, and Chinese Qinna/Chin Na.”

It is unclear what specific role Brown will serve in the corner of Buckley (13-4 MMA, 3-2 UFC), who battles Abdul Razak Alhassan (11-4 MMA, 5-4 UFC) on the main card. Regardless, his presence is a rare “celebrity” cornering during a UFC event.

UFC Fight Night 201 takes place Saturday at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas and streams on ESPN+.
