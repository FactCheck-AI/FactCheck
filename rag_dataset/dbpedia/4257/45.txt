Hollywood actor Bob Hoskins passed away earlier today. Some of his most memorable performances were on the big screen (I am sure most of us will remember him in Who Framed Roger Rabbit,) but he spent a lot of time on the stage as well. His stage debut was in 1969, playing Peter in a Victoria Theatre production of Romeo and Juliet.

Bob went on to have a lengthy career on stage, television and in film in both America and the UK. Let’s remember this great actor and the entertainment he provided us over the years. Here is a link to the BBC TV movie version of Othello from 1981 where he played Iago, alongside Anthony Hopkins in the titular role.

“Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt,

And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.

Do you go back dismayed? ’tis a lost fear.”

-Othello, Act V Scene 2
