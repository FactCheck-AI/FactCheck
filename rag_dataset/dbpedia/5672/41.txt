Terence Mordaunt is an entrepreneur and Chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation. He is the co-owner of The Bristol Port Company, where he has a controlling interest. For the last three decades, he has spearheaded the transformation and rejuvenation of Bristol Port into one of the UK’s largest, most successful marine hubs.

Terence is also the Chairman of Pendennis Shipyard, Founder of The Mordaunt Foundation, and Trustee of The Outward Bound Trust.

In 1991, Terence founded The Bristol Port Company with his business partner Sir David Ord, following their purchase of a majority stake in Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Docks from Bristol City Council. After their acquisition, Terence and Sir David led The Bristol Port Company through a period of heavy investment, which had not been seen for generations. The company made a pre-tax profit of £3 million in the first year of their ownership – the only time the Port had made a profit for two decades. It has since turned a profit every year under their ownership.

The Bristol Port is now one of the largest marine hubs in the UK and the largest in the South West. It is one of the few that maintains a permanent workforce and directly employs over 500 people, with over 20,000 jobs across the UK depending on the Port.

As Chairman, Terence remains a continued advocate for innovation, investment and the uptake of new technology. This strategy ensures the Port remains a vital feature of the South West economy, contributing £1 billion to UK GDP.

Terence founded The Mordaunt Foundation in 2016, which provides grants to a number of regional, national and international organisations. He has previously donated over £3 million to charitable causes in the South West. Since 2006, Terence has also been Chairman and a minority shareholder of Pendennis Shipyard Ltd, an award-winning superyacht firm that employs over 400 people.
