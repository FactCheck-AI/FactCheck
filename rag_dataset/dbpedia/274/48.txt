DEBUT 7” ‘FORECAST’ AVAILABLE OCTOBER 8, 2013 VIA FILE UNDER: MUSIC

LISTEN TO LEAD SINGLE “WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR MIND”. BANDANNOUNCE CANADIAN TOUR DATES THIS FALL

“Ari Shine and Adrienne Pierce have been recording music for years, working separately as solo artists before carving out The Royal Oui’s hazy, swooning sound together… The EP is called Forecast. And things are looking bright.” – American Songwriter

(September 4, 2013 – Toronto, ON) The Royal Oui could be the soundtrack to a Wes Anderson love story starring Jason Schwartzman and Michelle Williams. Quirky, slightly whimsical, with beautifully arranged harmonies, The Royal Oui craft songs with warmth and honesty, sharing their engaging perspective on love and life.

Comprised of Vancouver-based husband-and-wife duo Adrienne Pierce and Ari Shine, The Royal Oui will release their debut EP Forecast digitally and as a limited edition 7” on October 8, 2013 through File Under: Music (Bend Sinister, Kathryn Calder, Blackie & The Rodeo Kings) in Canada. The 2-song EP which features the playfully endearing single “When you Lose Your Mind” and beat-driven ethereal pop track “Actual Size”, serves as a teaser for the duo’s forthcoming full-length debut, which is slated for release in early 2014.

Before coming together to write with a shared voice as The Royal Oui, both Pierce and Shine were individually successful songwriters. Shine made his name as the co-winner of the John Lennon Song of The Year award in 2006. He was then shortlisted at the Grammy’s in 2012 for “Americana album of the year “ and was handpicked to tour alongside Foo Fighter’s lead guitarist Chris Shifflet. Pierce came into renown as the West Coast songstress who toured with the likes of Jane Siberry and Damien Rice, while having her songs exposed to millions through TV (Grey’s Anatomy), soundtrack albums (Veronica Mars), and commercial placements (FIAT).

The Royal Oui have just announced a slew of tour dates in support of their new EP. The duo will play their first show together on October 8th in Vancouver for a special EP release party at the Biltmore Cabaret. For full tour details see below.
