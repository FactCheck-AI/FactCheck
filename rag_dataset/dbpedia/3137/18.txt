Gameplay

The game is a top-scrolling rail shooter where the player may move left and right into one of seven spaces, touching the character will cause them to crouch while using the stylus to aim. Players may choose to be either Little Red Riding Hood, who specializes in guns, or Momotarō, who specializes in ninja stars, although the difference is merely aesthetic. The action of the game consists entirely of shooting and dodging incoming attacks with increasingly difficult obstacles as the game progresses.

Plot

The game takes place in Storyland with areas representing a number of classic fairy tales, such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and the Three Little Pigs. Little Red Riding Hood and Momotarō are the two playable characters. Little "READY TO ROCK" Riding Hood grew up in the forest, spending her time visiting her grandmother and hunting for food. She loves automatic firearms, citing "collecting weapons" as one of her hobbies. Momotarō is Little Red Riding Hood's friend, who was born from a giant peach. He has had over one thousand and one adventures including fighting off demons, finding lost treasures, and repelling threats from the underworld.

Little Red Riding Hood finds that something has gone wrong with Storyland soon after saving her grandmother from another wolf attack. Along with Momotarō, she decides to fight through the invading armies of zombies to find the source of the plague and destroy it.
