Visionary painter, wood engraver, translator and poet, who grew up in the Suffolk countryside and whose work was inspired by a boyhood visit to San Marco Convent, Florence, Italy, and the work of Fra Angelico. After gaining a first-class honours degree in English literature at Lincoln College, Oxford, Wagner was a guest student of Peter Greenham at the Royal Academy Schools, 1978â81. His pictures, which followed a study of the classic themes of Renaissance painting, stemmed from a strong Christian faith. William Blake, Samuel Palmer and the English pastoral tradition, Paul Nash and Stanley Spencer were exemplars. Wagner took part in many group exhibitions, latterly including Blakeâs Heaven, Scolar Fine Art, 2001; Roads to Damascus, The Brewhouse Gallery, Eton College, 2002; and Presence, St Paulâs Cathedral, 2004.
