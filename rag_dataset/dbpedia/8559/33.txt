Tania Bruguera is a Cuban performance and installation artist based in the United States. She has established a significant career through provocative works that address power and control themes, often engaging directly with political realities. Bruguera's art revolves around complex issues such as immigration, capitalism, and authoritarianism, using the concept of Arte Útil (Useful Art) to challenge the traditional boundaries and roles of art and audience.Her notable projects include the long-term initiative "Immigrant Movement International," a community-based art project in Queens, New York, and the politically charged "Tatlin’s Whisper #5," which was exhibited at the Tate Modern. This latter work is famous for its live performance element that invited participants to experience a moment of free speech, highlighting the censorship and suppression prevalent in many societies. Her works have been displayed in prestigious venues worldwide, including the Venice Biennale and the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York.
