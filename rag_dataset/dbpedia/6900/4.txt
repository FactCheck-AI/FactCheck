The Norman Borlaug lecture series began in 2002 and is named for the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize winner and founder of the World Food Prize. Dr. Norman Borlaug (1914-2009) was a Cresco, Iowa, native whose discoveries sparked the Green Revolution. He received the Nobel Peace Prize for his contribution to world peace through his wheat research and production that saved millions of lives worldwide. He founded the World Food Prize in 1986 to recognize the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world.

The annual lecture coincides with the World Food Prize International Symposium and features a speaker who is a leader in areas related to World Food Prize themes.

Prior to the lecture, Iowa State University students take part in the Norman Borlaug Lectureship Poster Competition for Graduate and Undergraduate Students. The public is invited to view the students' posters in the hour prior to the start of the lecture.

The fall 2023 Norman Borlaug Lecture took place Oct. 23, in the Great Hall of the Memorial Union, presented by 2023 World Food Prize Laureate Heidi Kühn.
