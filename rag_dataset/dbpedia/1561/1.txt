The California Digital Newspaper Collection is a project of the Center for Bibliographical Studies and Research (CBSR) at the University of California, Riverside.

The CDNC is supported in whole or in part by funding provided by the State of California, administered by the California State Library.

The CBSR has received five grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities to digitize California newspapers for the National Digital Newspaper Program. Titles digitized as part of the NDNP are available both here and at the Library of Congress Chronicling America website.

We are eager to know what users think of this site. Please email your comments to cbsrinfo@ucr.edu.
