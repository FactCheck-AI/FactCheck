A mistaken pedigree for him was published by professional genealogist, Gary Boyd Roberts, in which he confused 2 similarily sounding names, Ulysses Selden Young and Ulysses Anson Young who share no common relatives. [1] [2]

There is no evidence substantiating a marriage or even relationship beyond friends, with Meryl Streep. [3]
