Never before have the world's many wonders been quite as accessible as they are in this stunning nature series. In the filming process, many shots and events were captured on camera for the first time; viewers will marvel at a glimpse of the rare snow leopard (one of only 40 surviving in the wild) hunting in the Himalayas, the blue bird of paradise strutting his stuff to woo a mate, and grizzly bears bringing their newborns out into the light.

Planet Earth also uses flawless time-lapse photography to show climate and seasonal changes -- like a sandstorm in the Sahara Desert or the transformation of parched desert land in Africa into a lush feeding ground for species of all shapes and sizes. Satellite photos of Earth and high-speed cameras that preserve animals' motion round out this truly unprecedented package. Narrated by actress/conservationist Sigourney Weaver, Planet Earth will educate and inspire the whole family. Just take care to explain the basics of animal behavior to young viewers, because some scenes of creatures hunting and killing prey could upset them.
