ABC is bringing back a classic and they're enlisting a bunch of TV stars to help them out.

The competition series Battle of the Network Stars is getting the revival treatment, EW reports. The original show ran from 1976 to 1985 and featured celebs from the Big Three Networks like Good Times' Jimmie Walker and One Day at a Time's Mackenzie Phillips, who will both be competing in the reboot.

This time around, the roster has expanded to include additional networks and categories. Competitors include Buffy the Vampire Slayer alumni Julie Benz and Charisma Carpenter, O.C. star Mischa Barton, NSYNC's Joey Fatone and Lance Bass, actors Taye Diggs and Vivica A. Fox, former child stars Joey Lawrence and Kim Fields, and many more. Like, so many -- there will be 100 competitors in total.
