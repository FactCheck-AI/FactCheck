White label refers to a business practice where a product or service is produced by one company (the producer or manufacturer) and is then rebranded and sold by another company (the retailer or reseller) under their own brand name. Essentially, the end product appears as if the retailer itself had produced it, with no visible indication of the original manufacturer. This strategy is particularly common in industries where creating or maintaining a product from scratch may be costly or time-consuming for the reselling entity.
