What do you consider to be a "dead" game?

I realize that this is going to be largely subjective, but I'm curious what your "metrics" are for determining whether a game is dead or not.

Some might say that as long as it has at least 1 player, it cannot be dead.

Others, like myself, believe that it's a bit more complicated, and it includes but not limited to:

player drop %

current # of players

how decreased player count has impacted mp play if it is mp

lack of developer communication/news

lack of updates or continued development

lack of community activity.

Both seem to be on opposite sides of the spectrum though. One being rather simplistic (requires 0 players to be "dead), the other uses several different metrics.

How do YOU define whether or not a game is "dead"?
