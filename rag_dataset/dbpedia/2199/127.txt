Mayday Parade have released a video for their new single Miracle.

“Miracle is a song I started working on during our Sunnyland record (2018) and didn’t fully complete until after we finished recording our What It Means To Fall Apart record in 2021,” says vocalist/drummer Jake Bundrick. “I was in a darker place in life during that span and was silently fighting for air. I felt alone and scared to talk about my feelings with anyone else including the people closest to me. Life was happening way too fast for me and I wasn’t ready for it or able to accept what was happening. I felt alone and knew I needed to talk about it but didn’t know how. Organically the song just came together and was the culmination of that entire span of time. Life moves faster than you can imagine and as much as you think you’re ready for what it throws at you, it can catch you off guard. It definitely did for me.”
