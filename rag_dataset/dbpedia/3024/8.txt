INDIANAPOLIS â€“ The Texas A&M baseball team earned its fourth top-eight national seed all-time Monday morning as the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship Selection Committee named the Aggies as the No. 3 overall seed, the highest in program history.

The top-eight national seed marks the second of the Jim Schlossnagle era and first since 2022, when the Maroon & White served as the No. 5 overall seed. With the national seed, the Aggies will host their 13th NCAA Regional at Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park.

Texas A&M earned an at-large bid after compiling a 43-13 record, including a 19-11 mark in SEC play. The selection marks the third straight for the Aggies and 38th in program history. Outside of SEC play this season, the Maroon & White were a perfect 25-0 for the first time since 2015.

The Aggies will serve as the No. 1 seed in the Bryan-College Station Regional and will face No. 4 seed Grambling on Friday May 31 at 12 p.m. No. 2 seed Louisiana and No. 3 seed Texas make up the remainder of the regional at Blue Bell Park.

The winner of the Bryan-College Station Regional will face the winner of the UC Santa Barbara Regional for a trip to the 2024 College World Series.
