Dell Technologies, a multinational technology company, has a history that dates back to its founding by Michael Dell in 1984. The company began as PC's Limited, initially selling IBM-compatible computers built from stock components. Dell was known for its direct-to-consumer sales model, allowing customers to customize their computer configurations. Dell has become a prominent player in the technology industry, offering a wide range of products and services, including personal computers, servers, storage devices, and IT consulting. The company's logo and brand are well-recognized in the computing and technology sectors. DELL was first registered as a trademark on December 24, 1984.

Dell has been involved in a number of trademark disputes in the past years. In March 2001, Dell Computer discovered that Dell Technologies, an India-based firm involved in computer leasing, assembly, and sales, was using the DELL mark in its trade name. After issuing a cease-and-desist notice and receiving no response, Dell Computer initiated legal proceedings in February 2002. Dell argued that its trade name derived from the surname of its founder, Michael Dell, and that Dell Technologies' use of the DELL mark constituted trademark infringement. The Delhi High Court ruled in favor of Dell Computer, stating that Dell Technologies' use of the DELL mark could lead to consumer confusion and misappropriate Dell's goodwill.
