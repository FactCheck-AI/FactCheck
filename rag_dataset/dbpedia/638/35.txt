A belated sequel to 1944’s National Velvet, which was the story of how Velvet Brown entered her beloved horse in the Grand National. Now Velvet is all grown up (as played by Nanette Newman, wife of the movie’s director, Bryan Forbes) and has a niece named Sarah (O’Neal) who wants to be an Olympic horsewoman with the help of trainer Captain Johnson (Anthony Hopkins).

The plot here is pretty weak, but there are a few classy British actors (as well as Hopkins, there’s Peter Barkworth, Stephanie Cole and a handful of recognisable character actors) to spur things along until the climactic end. Watch out for Newman and Forbes’s daughter Emma Forbes (now a TV presenter) in a small role. One for horsey fans only.

Is International Velvet suitable for kids? Here are our parents’ notes...

None.
