EDITORS COMMENTS

Bryan Forbes, the renowned director, is captured in this heartwarming print alongside his wife Nanette Newman and their daughters Sarah and Emma. The year is 1979, as they embark on a much-needed Caribbean holiday from Heathrow Airport. However, this family vacation holds a bittersweet twist as young Emma finds herself confined to a wheelchair due to a broken leg sustained during an unfortunate tobogganing accident. Despite the setback, the Forbes family radiates love and resilience in this snapshot frozen in time. Bryan's success in the entertainment industry has not overshadowed his role as a devoted husband and father. Nanette, an accomplished actress herself, stands by his side with unwavering support. Sarah, aged 19 at the time of this photograph, exudes maturity beyond her years while caring for her younger sister. Emma's vibrant spirit shines through despite her temporary physical limitation – she embraces life with unyielding determination. As they prepare to board their flight amidst bustling airport activity typical of that era, one can only imagine the anticipation building within them for what lies ahead on their tropical getaway. This image serves as a reminder that even amidst challenges and setbacks, familial bonds remain unbreakable.
