You can check our video guide on how to point your domain to SiteGround or follow the instructions below the video:

In order to point your website to SiteGround, you need to use SiteGround’s name servers:

ns1.siteground.net ns2.siteground.net

Go to your domain Registrar’s management panel (this might be your previous hosting provider or else) and find the corresponding domain management forms to update the name servers.

See how you can do that with Bluehost, GoDaddy, HostGator, DreamHost, Namecheap, and Google Domains.

You can see this information from your Client Area > Websites. From the list of your websites, locate the one you want to check and click the kebab menu, then press the Website Settings button.

Then click on the kebab menu and select Server Details.

The light-box which will appear on the screen will display the IP address of the website, and its Name Servers (NS 1 and NS 2).

To see IPs of the nameservers, go to Website Settings > click on the kebab menu and select Server Details. Then click the Show IP Addresses button.

When you point your name servers to SiteGround, your domain DNS records (A record, MX records, CNAME record, and all) and emails will be managed from your SiteGround account from thereon.

If you have any custom DNS records you need to keep, you can use the DNS Zone Editor in your Client Area to set them before you change the name servers.
