Research

My program of research focuses on brainwave entrainment for the management of hyper-arousal related health conditions such as insomnia and hypertension. I am currently conducting research to evaluate the effectiveness of the slow brainwave light-sound stimulation for sleep promotion in people with chronic pain. My general research interest is in the area of non-pharmacological approaches that empower self-regulation for health promotion.

Teaching: I have taught in both undergraduate and graduate programs. My main teaching role is in the psychiatry and mental health track. I believe in educating the whole person, with an emphasis on developing life-long learners and socially responsible health professionals.

Practice, Service, Community Involvement: Clinically, I am an Adult Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner. My practice philosophy embraces interdisciplinary collaboration model. I believe the patient-provider partnership is the core for the optimal care outcome.
