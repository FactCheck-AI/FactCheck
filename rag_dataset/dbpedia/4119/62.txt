Turkey national team coach Fatih Terim has left his job two weeks after he was involved in a brawl in a west coast holiday town, the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) said in a statement on Wednesday.

The 63-year-old former Fiorentina, AC Milan and Galatasaray boss, was seen in television footage fighting with a restaurant owner.

Turkish media said he and his sons-in-law left five men injured after the incident.

'Some non-football issues have been wearing out our football director Fatih Terim and the management of Turkish football federation,' TFF said on Wednesday.

'The two sides agreed that it would be more healthy for both parties to part ways,' it added.

Video from the incident shows a fracas involving Terim, who is then pictured walking away.

People are seen running towards the entrance of the restaurant, however the incident itself is obscured by a parasol and some trees.

Terim took over the Turkey job back in August 2013, first failing to qualify for the World Cup before eventually managing to secure a place at Euro 2016.
