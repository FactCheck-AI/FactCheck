Sha Na Na Is Here to Stay is a compilation album by revival/nostalgia musical group Sha Na Na, released by Buddah Records in 1977.

On the front cover, the band’s name and album title are variants of Seymour Chwast’s Push Pin Myopic, with the Open C variant used for “Sha Na Na” and the solid variant used for “Is Here to Stay”. Both are set in all caps with the album title styled as a faux-italic.

On the back cover, the track titles are set in various weights of Hermann Zapf’s Optima.

Formed in New York City in 1969, Sha Na Na gained notoriety after appearing as the counter-counterculture doo-wop group at the Woodstock Music Festival, performing before Jimi Hendrix, who, according to Wikipedia, recommended Sha Na Na for the gig.

Wikipedia also credits their appearance in the 1970 Woodstock documentary with inspiring the 1950s musical revival that was popular during the 1970s:

Subsequently, the inclusion of their performance of “At the Hop” in Michael Wadleigh’s award-winning documentary film of the [Woodstock] festival made Sha Na Na nationally famous and helped spark a 1950s nostalgia craze that inspired similar groups (Flash Cadillac, Showaddywaddy, Big Daddy), as well as the Broadway musical Grease (and its feature film adaptation), the feature film American Graffiti and the TV show Happy Days.
