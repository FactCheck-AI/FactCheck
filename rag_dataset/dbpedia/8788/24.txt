Sha Na Na is an American Rock & Roll cover band that features singers who also dance on stage. Even for 1969, they were anachronistic focusing on '50s music and outfits. The group was founded in 1968 and didn't have an album contract by the time they played at Woodstock[1][2][3]. Sha Na Na was the next to last act of Woodstock succeeded by Jimi Hendrix. They performed at 7:30 PM on the morning of Monday, August 18th.

Details[]

As the movie shows the audience was left amazed with Sha Na Na's music. The people who were still at the festival site were waiting for the final act, Jimi Hendrix. Instead they were treated with some Rock & Roll dancing act. Rob Leonard[4] and David Garrett[5] claimed that they were asked to play the Woodstock Festival based upon Jimi Hendrix's recommendation to the Woodstock producers after Hendrix saw Sha Na Na at Steve Paul's The Scene Club during the summer of 1969.

But Sha Na Na wasn't bad at all. In fact they were quite entertaining playing some old-fashioned Rock & Roll in the vein of Teen Pop and Doo Wop. At times they even break out with a short, fifties-style guitar solo for instance in the song "At the Hop".

Since Woodstock, they've continued to perform and have had many group members over the years. They even had their own TV show from 1977-1981, and appeared in the movie "Grease" as Johnny Casino & The Gamblers.

Availability[]

Only about 15 minutes of recordings - which are already seven songs - are available. Mostly they can be found on film outtakes. "At the Hop", which ends with the "Na Na Theme", is included in the movie and on the box-set. "Teen Angel" is available on the Woodstock 40th Anniversary DVD. "Duke of Earl" is available on Woodstock Diaries.
