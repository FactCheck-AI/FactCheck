Turkish footballers Ismail Yuksek, Ferdi Kadioglu, and Çaglar Soyuncu, players from Fenerbahçe, will miss their national team's debut against Georgia in Euro 2024 due to not being in full fitness, as announced by the Turkish Football Federation.

Yuksek and Kadioglu, midfielder and defender respectively, "are in good condition but not at 100%," stated Hamit Altıntop, a director of the Turkish Federation, to local media.

The director mentioned that by resting them, they may be fully fit for the subsequent group stage matches, against Portugal on the 22nd and the Czech Republic on the 26th.

Turkey will also be without defender Çaglar Soyuncu, who is injured. Soyuncu, a player for Atlético de Madrid currently on loan to Fenerbahçe, will be unavailable.

Additionally, midfielder İrfan Can Kahveci is doubtful for the Georgia match after sustaining an injury in a friendly on June 10, where Turkey lost 2-1 to Poland.
