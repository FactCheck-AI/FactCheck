His Majesty King Faisal II bin Ghazi, may God bless his soul, was born in 1935. He was the third king of Iraq from the Hashemite family. He ascended the throne in 1939 following the death of his father, King Ghazi, and became king under the regency of his uncle, Prince Abdul Ilah bin Ali, until he reached the legal age for ruling and was crowned king on May 2, 1953.

The coronation of His Majesty King Faisal II as the King of Iraq coincided with the coronation of his cousin, His Majesty King Hussein bin Talal, as the King of Jordan.

In 1958, an Arab Hashemite union was established between the Hashemite Kingdoms of Jordan and Iraq during the reign of His Majesty King Hussein bin Talal and His Majesty King Faisal II bin Ghazi, may God have mercy on them. This union was proposed by King Hussein and was known as 'The Arab Hashemite Union.'
