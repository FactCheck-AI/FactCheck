Erling Aastad was a track and field athlete who competed for Norway. He competed at the 1920, 1924, and 1928 Summer Olympic Games. He passed away on 30 June 1963, at the age of 65.

At his first appearance in the long jump competition at the Olympic Games in Antwerp in 1920, he was the best of three Norwegian athletes, and the only one of the three to advance to the final. He took the last qualification spot by jumping a distance of 6.62 metres, only 2 centimetres better than the American champion Sol Butler. In this final, he was joined by three Swedish athletes and two Americans. With a jump of 6.885 metres, he was able to finish fifth. According to reports, he was also the first reserve for the relay team that was disqualified in their semifinal.

Four years later, the format of the competition was slightly different. Instead of the 6 athletes with the best performance in a qualification round advancing to the final, the competitors were divided into four groups. Aastad finished fourth in the third group, finishing thirteenth in total and failing to qualify for the final.

He would participate at his third Olympic Games four years later, and just like in Paris, he failed to qualify for the final. He finished fourth in the first group, despite his farthest Olympic jump in eight years. The athletes in front of him in his group were Ed Hamm and Silvio Cator, who won gold and silver, and Erich Kochermann, who finished fifth.
