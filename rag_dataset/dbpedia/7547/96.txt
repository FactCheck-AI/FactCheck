The Republic of Seychelles is an arcipelago of 155 islands situated in the Indian Ocean, southeast of mainland Eastern Africa. With a territory of 177 square miles and a population of 92000, the Seychelles is the smallest African country. The country gained independence from the British in 1976. It is now a presidential republic. Since independence, its economy has grown seven-fold, from a near-subsistence level to being part of the upper-middle income group. Most of its economic growth depends on tourism.
