There will be a new manny on Modern Family when the ABC sitcom returns for its fifth season next month. Fans of Rico Rodriguez’s old soul Manny Delgado need not worry, though: The second manny is actually a male nanny, and Vulture has learned that he will be played by Workaholics co-creator and Pitch Perfect co-star Adam DeVine. Modern Family co-creator Christopher Lloyd told Vulture that DeVine’s character will will be hired by Jay (Ed O’Neill) and Gloria (Sofia Vegara) to help with little Joe, the bundle of joy the couple welcomed last season. The role will be recurring, with DeVine making several appearances. No word yet on whether DeVine’s manny will be as sensitive as the manny Freddie Prinze Jr. played on Friends.

Meanwhile, after telling reporters in June that nuptials for Cam and Mitch were a “real possibility” following the Supreme Court’s landmark DOMA decision, Lloyd confirmed that the idea of the two men getting hitched is “definitely something that will come up in their world” during season five. “There will be a lot of discussion in Mitch and Cam’s household [about marriage],” he added. The producer also told us viewers can expect another family vacation episode of the show next season, shot on location at what he called an “exotic locale” outside the United States (he wouldn’t confirm the spot just yet). And, after skipping a Christmas episode last year, there will “probably” be one in December (though it’s also possible producers will choose a Thanksgiving-themed half hour). Finally, one more bit of possible casting news: Lloyd says he and fellow exec producer Steve Levitan have already approached Kevin Hart about making a third visit to Modern Family.
