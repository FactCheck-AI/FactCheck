Pitch Perfect's TV spin-off, Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin, has released its first teaser and some new images of its cast.

The streaming series follow-up to the movies sees Adam DeVine and Flula Borg reprise their movie roles of Bumper Allen and Pieter Krämer, respectively.

Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law and The Good Place's Jameela Jamil, and model-turned-actress Lera Abova are joining the franchise as new characters Heidi, Gisela and DJ Das Boot, respectively.

As we can see in the photos, Jamil's Gisela is quite the extravagantly dressed performer, while Hyland's Heidi is a bit more low-key, although we're not sure if we're getting more 'best friend' or 'love interest' vibes yet.

The teaser sees Bumper re-introducing himself to the camera against a humorously over-blurred background, before singing a medley of songs including A-ha's 'Take on Me' and Nena's '99 Luftballoons'.

The premise of the series follows Bumper as he tries to revive his music career by travelling to Germany after one of his songs inexplicably becomes popular there. Krämer, now a music manager, takes Bumper on as his only client. What could go wrong?

Pitch Perfect: Bumper in Berlin premieres on November 23 on in the US. The streamer is available via Sky and NOW in the UK, but there isn't a premiere date for the show just yet.
