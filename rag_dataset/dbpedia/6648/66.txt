Boxing video games allow players to experience the thrill of the ring without risk of injury. Since the 1980s, developers have tried to digitally recreate the sweet science of pugilism, with varying degrees of success.

While boxing games are not as prevalent as they once were, there are still great options for PC gamers in 2023. Whether you want a hardcore simulation, arcade-style action, or an intense VR workout, the current crop of boxing titles deliver.

In this guide, we highlight the 7 best boxing games you can play on PC right now.

1. Undisputed (Early Access)

Best For: Hardcore boxing simulation

Still in early access, Undisputed aims to be the most realistic digital boxing experience ever created. Developed by Sheffield, UK-based Steel City Interactive, Undisputed utilizes the Unreal Engine to power its lifelike visuals and physics-based gameplay.

The striking mechanics are incredibly nuanced, with over 70 possible punch combinations accessible via the control scheme. Slipping, bobbing, weaving, parrying, clinching, and applying effective footwork are all critical to winning matches. No boxing game has captured the sweet science more authentically.

Undisputed’s roster features over 50 licensed boxers, including greats like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Roberto Duran, and Julio Cesar Chavez. You can take control of these legends in their primes, or create your own custom fighter and take them from amateur events to world title glory. Promoter, manager, and training modes round out the experience.

Despite some expected early access bugs, Undisputed shows tremendous promise. Developer Steel City Interactive actively incorporates community feedback to make enhancements. If you want the closest thing to lacing up the gloves and stepping into the ring, Undisputed is a knockout.

Pros

Incredibly realistic boxing mechanics

Massive roster of licensed legends

Visually stunning with smooth animations

Cons

Still in development so has some issues

Can be punishingly difficult for casual players

2. Creed: Rise to Glory

Best For: VR boxing experience

Creed: Rise to Glory brings sweat-inducing, heart-pumping boxing action to room-scale VR. As the name suggests, the game is set in the cinematic universe of the Rocky/Creed films. You can train with Rocky Balboa himself, or go toe-to-toe with famous faces like Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, and Apollo Creed.

Gameplay revolves around dodging and parrying incoming blows while tactically exploiting openings in your opponent‘s guard. Punches are thrown by realistically jabbing, hooking, and uppercutting with the Touch controllers. Duck under haymakers or dance around the ring, and you’ll quickly work up a sweat.

The campaign puts you in the gloves of underdog Adonis Creed, fighting your way from amateur bouts all the way to the world championship. Beyond career mode, there are several multiplayer options to test your skills against human opponents. Customization lets you decorate your virtual gym and boxers.

While the VR visuals are somewhat basic, the responsive controls and adrenaline-fueled action make Creed: Rise to Glory the most immersive and athletic boxing game around. Just be ready for some sore muscles the next day!

Pros

Great VR implementation with motion controls

Faithful to Rocky universe with iconic fighters

Workout-worthy physical intensity

Cons

Multiplayer can suffer from lag

Basic visuals don’t fully impress

3. Fight Night Champion

Best For: Legacy boxing gameplay

First released in 2011, Fight Night Champion still stands as the high point of EA Sports‘ boxing series. Although it‘s over a decade old, the gameplay, graphics, modes, and overall presentation hold up remarkably well, especially after applying community patches.

Unlike the ultra-complex Undisputed, Fight Night Champion features more accessible controls that still provide a great balance between offense and defense. The analog stick mimics your boxer‘s fists to jab, hook, and uppercut with ease. The roster contains past and present pros, including Manny Pacquiao, Miguel Cotto, and Andre Ward.

Fight Night impresses out of the ring too. An in-depth career mode sees your created boxer rise up the ranks, training and participating in press conferences along the way. The underrated Champion mode delivers an engrossing story campaign. And the graphics, animations, and damage modeling still look great.

While the online components no longer function, Fight Night Champion remains the best single-player boxing experience on PC. From sweat-flying ring action to training minigames to legacy appeal, it‘s a knockout.

Pros

Excellent gameplay balance

In-depth career and story modes

Visuals hold up incredibly well

Cons

No multiplayer options

DLC no longer available

4. Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions

Best For: Arcade-style action

A spiritual successor to the Punch-Out series, Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions delivers over-the-top arcade boxing action. Featuring a cel-shaded comic book style, Creed Champions lets you play as Rocky Balboa, Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed, Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, and more.

Gameplay revolves around stringing together combos while making effective use of rolls, blocks, and perfectly-timed punches. Opponents telegraph their attacks, so pattern recognition and quick reflexes are rewarded. Matches are fast-paced, frantic battles filled with slow-mo close-ups of knockout blows.

In addition to exhibition bouts, there are 30 challenging story fights that recreate iconic moments from the films. Up to 4 players can Duke it out locally or online. Visually, Creed Champions nicely captures the look and spirit of the movie franchise.

Those seeking a realistic boxing simulation should look elsewhere. But if you grew up with arcade classics like Punch-Out!! and Ready 2 Rumble, Creed Champions will satisfy your appetite for over-the-top pugilistic action.

Pros

Perfect for quick pick-up-and-play sessions

Fun combat system with special moves

Local and online multiplayer

Cons

Very little depth compared to sims

Story mode completion unlocks could be better

5. The Thrill of the Fight (VR)

Best For: VR fitness

Looking to burn some calories and work up a serious sweat? Lace up your virtual gloves and enter The Thrill of the Fight. This VR boxing game prioritizes tiring, physical gameplay over fancy graphics and modes. And the resulting workout experience is incredible.

Holding Touch controllers in a tight boxer‘s guard, you‘ll be slipping punches, bobbing your head, and throwing combos at a rapid pace. With limited stamina, the pacing demands constant movement and tactical shot selection. Opponents hit hard and fast, so keeping your guard up and managing distance is imperative.

Matches take place in a simple virtual gym with no bells and whistles. But compelling gameplay makes The Thrill of the Fight endlessly replayable. Attempting to climb the leaderboards against more challenging opponents will leave your arms burning.

If you want to elevate your heart rate in VR while having fun, The Thrill of the Fight is your best bet. Just make sure there‘s nothing breakable nearby, as dodging often necessitates real lateral movement!

Pros

Amazing VR workout experience

Requires true boxing technique

Addictive progression system

Cons

Very basic visually

Won‘t appeal to non-fitness focused players

6. eSports Boxing Club (Early Access)

Best For: Multiplayer focus

The newcomer eSports Boxing Club aims to be the premier competitive online boxing game. Still in early access, the game‘s rounded visuals and slick animations already impress. The physics-based gameplay delivers complex mechanics with an accessible control scheme.

ESBC contains licensed fighters from multiple weight classes, including Tyson Fury, but focuses on creating your own pro and taking them into the competitive ranks online. Options like Custom Championships and Fight Now ease matchmaking, while in-depth training prepares you for heated exchanges.

Since it‘s built as an eSport from day one, online play is silky smooth. Quick jabs and explosive counters feel satisfying to land against human opponents. Stat-tracking and future ranked modes should up the stakes.

While solo offerings feel light currently, the foundation for greatness is here. Once ESBC gets more modes, boxers, and progression systems, it could become a top contender. Even in early access, the multiplayer competition is highly engaging.

Pros

Super smooth online with great netcode

Accessible but deep mechanics

Visually impressive models and animations

Cons

Career mode needs more depth

Small fighter roster currently

7. Real Boxing 2

Best For: Mobile gaming

Among surprisingly few quality mobile boxing options, Real Boxing 2 stands out. With intuitive touchscreen controls and plenty of gameplay variety, it‘s one of the better sports titles on Android and iOS.

Real Boxing 2 contains different control schemes tailored to touch devices. The virtual buttons and swipes work well for dodging, blocking, and punching. Arcade, career, and multiplayer modes offer diverse ways to play, with RP progression incentivizing fights.

Developer Vivid Games made sure Real Boxing 2 looks great on mobile. The boxers and environments showcase plenty of details. Matches attempt to mimic TV broadcasts with replays and audio commentary. There‘s even a "dynamic wounds" system where bruises, cuts, and swelling will appear on fighters.

For a mobile game, Real Boxing 2 has impressive depth. Fans of fight night looking for quality action on the go would do well to lace up and enter the ring.

Pros

Excellent production values

Good variety of modes

Intuitive touchscreen controls

Cons

Improved opponent AI would be nice

Can feel repetitive over time

Wrapping Up

Thanks to refined mechanics and new platforms like VR, there are great options for digital pugilists in 2023. Whether you’re looking for complex simulations, explosive arcade action, or an intense workout, quality boxing games are available for PC gamers.

For the best overall package, Undisputed currently leads the way with its uncompromising realism and extensive legacy roster. But Creed: Rise to Glory and The Thrill of the Fight make great use of VR, while Fight Night Champion holds up strong as a beloved classic.

Now grab your favorite set of virtual gloves and start training for your next bout! Just watch out for tko-inducing body blows and make sure to keep that guard hand glued to your chin.
