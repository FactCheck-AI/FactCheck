Prescott is a city in as well as the county seat of Yavapai County, Arizona, and is currently home to over 41,000 people. Prescott was the first territorial capital of the Arizona Territory when it was created, until it was moved to Tucson in 1867, then moved back to Prescott ten years later, and finally settling in Phoenix in 1889.

The city is actually situated just over a mile above sea level, giving the city much cooler temperatures than the rest of the cities in Arizona due to the higher altitude, and yet it does not receive the harsher winters that cities at high altitudes are known for.

The city was founded just after the Arizona Territory was organized, with then-governor John Goodwin picking out where the city was to be founded. It was actually founded some 20 miles south of present-day Prescott, and was moved a few years later to the new site with Fort Whipple, the first capital of the Arizona Territory.

After several major fires in the early part of the 20th century, the entire downtown was rebuilt with brick to prevent other catastrophes. It is the home to over 525 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places, and the city is chock-full of Victorian-styles buildings.

With the city being over a mile above sea level, itâ€™s no doubt that temperatures are much lower than most other cities in the state. Its average high in the summer is a lean 86 degrees, while the average low is a mere 56; in the winter, lows average around 25 degrees with highs around 55. The city is known for its many museums, art houses, zoos and other sites of attraction, which many people have remarked on.
