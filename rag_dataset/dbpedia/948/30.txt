The Summer 2024 edition of Northumbria University’s newspaper is available to collect on campus or read online now.

Packed with the latest news, features and interviews, the newspaper is the perfect way to keep up to date with the exciting developments taking place across the University.

In this issue we highlight Northumbria’s growing reputation as the home of space research, in the North of England and beyond. Our front-page story sets out plans for the new North East Space Skills and Technology centre (NESST) – a £50 million development on Northumbria’s city centre campus, established in collaboration with the UK Space Agency and global aerospace company Lockheed Martin UK Space.

Inside, a special four-page pull-out highlights the wide variety of space-related research taking place at Northumbria by academics working across a diverse range of disciplines, including arts, geography, mathematics, law, physiology, humanities and engineering.

Included with this issue you will also find our supplement Born of Ambition – a special publication setting out Northumbria’s vision for the future. It explores the University’s interlocking ambitions – to carry out research which tackles the big regional, national and global challenges we face; to empower students to achieve their career and life ambitions beyond graduation; and to maintain a clear social mobility mission, helping students from all backgrounds to reach their potential. With interviews from Northumbria staff, students, graduates and key regional partners, the publication focuses on the ways Northumbria is driving change, inspiring potential and changing lives.
