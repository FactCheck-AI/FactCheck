Unintentionally funny eco-horror film from director Bert I. Gordon about super intelligent, giant ants on the loose in the Florida everglades. Based on a short story by H.G. Wells, EMPIRE OF THE ANTS is a typical Gordon disaster, full of cheap special effects and ham acting. The man must have really had an infatuation with size, as he had already enlarged rats, wasps, grasshoppers, spiders and even man in previous film efforts.

Itâ€™s no picnic!
