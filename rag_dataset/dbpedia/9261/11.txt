Puerto de la Bah√≠a de Algeciras (Port of the Bay of Algeciras') is the largest Spanish seaport. The port is located on the Bay of Gibraltar on the Mediterranean Sea, in the town of Algeciras and a number of neighboring municipalities, in the Andalusia region. The port falls under the maritime province of Algeciras. Its strategic location on the Strait of Gibraltar between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, and its proximity to North Africa (particularly Morocco), make it an important international port.
