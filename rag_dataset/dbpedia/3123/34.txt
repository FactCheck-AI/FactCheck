For the 2006 game, see Scarface: The World is Yours.

Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a video game for the PlayStation Portable and Windows Mobile released in October 2006, based on the film starring Al Pacino.

While the Scarface: The World Is Yours game for the PC, Xbox, PlayStation 2, and Wii was developed by Radical Entertainment; Scarface: Money. Power. Respect was developed by FarSight Studios. Unlike The World Is Yours, which is an open-world third-person action game, Scarface: Money. Power. Respect. is a turn-based strategy game featuring both single and multiplayer modes. Only a couple of the voice actors from the console version reprise their roles in this game, with Robert Loggia actually reprising his role as Frank Lopez.

Gameplay[]

The game challenges the player to make strategic decisions to rise to power and to direct an army of gunmen while fighting. In single-player story mode the player will direct strategic citywide commands to dominate street-level real time combat. The game challenges the player to handle large territory, adversaries and profit-making opportunities through drug trafficking. In multiplayer mode it pits four players as criminal cartels in a race to gain money and turf. Through turn based showdowns and real time combat each player will manage production and distribution of drugs, build up enough cartel strength to overpower adversaries, conquer turf and rule the Miami drug scene.
