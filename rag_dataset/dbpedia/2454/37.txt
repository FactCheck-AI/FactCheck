Han Rewrites CSUB History in Closing Eagle Invite

SPOKANE, Wash. â€“ Freshman Iris Han started the Eagle Invitational by tying a CSU Bakersfield record on Monday and she closed out the tournament on Wednesday by breaking another Roadrunner record. Wrapping up the week with 220 strokes (+4) on her scorecard, Han reset the all-time CSUB record for 54-hole tournament score while placing in the Top 10 at Indian Canyon Golf Course.

Quotes from Head Coach Tiffanie Yabut

"I am extremely impressed with the performance from Iris. To be in contention to win a tournament and break school records as a freshman is an incredible feat and she did it with such a calm yet dominant demeanor."

"Iris kept putting herself in good position to score and played solid, steady golf all week...It's great to have a local pave the way in changing the direction of the program."

"We left a lot of shots out there, so while there's feelings of disappointment, there is a lot to be proud of and build off of going forward. It's a learning experience trying to put three solid rounds together."

Notables

Playing in just her second collegiate tournament, Han overtook former `Runner greats Tori Peers and Ariel Lee, who combined to rewrite the CSUB record books before graduating in 2018.

Peers and Lee were co-leaders in the category before as each recorded tournament scores of 221 (+5) in the 2017-18 season.

As a team, Bakersfield finished the tournament with 921 strokes, the second-best three-round total in program history.
