No. The LISST-Tau is offered only with a 15 cm (0.15 m) path length.

Theoretically, a long path length transmissometer (say, 1 m) would enable measurements of transmission values >> 0.999. However, Sequoia has found that the practical implementation of a long path length transmissometer is hampered by mechanical issues, e.g., difficulties in keeping the instrument aligned under pressure. By and large, these mechanical issues offset the theoretical advantage one would expect from the longer path length.

If you want to measure beam attenuation in waters where a path length < 15 cm is required, Sequoia recommends the LISST-200X or LISST-Glider.

LISST was originally an acronym for our laser particle sizing sensors. LISST now is just a Sequoia trade mark.

Tau is the name of the Greek letter τ. In marine optics, τ has traditionally been used to denote optical transmission, the fundamental measurement made by the LISST-Tau.

Beam attenuation, c, is related to optical transmission, τ, thus:

c = (1/r) · ln(τ), where r is the optical path length in m (0.15 m for LISST-Tau).

The LISST-Tau has no internal power or memory of any kind. So it can in fact ONLY be used with an external power and datalogging system:

Either a PC running the LISST-Tau software (this setup is really only suitable for lab use) OR

a dedicated data logger OR

integrated into a larger system that provides power and logging (e.g., a CTD, tow body, float, glider etc.).

The LISST-Tau outputs data in either analog or RS-232 format, so any datalogger or system that can handle this will suffice. The LISST-Tau manual (see Software & Downloads tab) describes this.

Sequoia does not recommend a particular logger or system for the LISST-Tau. The best logger solution depends on the exact application – discuss with a datalogger manufacturer / supplier / system integrator, e.g.:
