A Champing church run by the Churches Conservation Trust.

Not technically a Sanctuary, but we have included as a great stop for Sanctuary Users on the Old Way. The small and welcoming church of St Maryâs in Fordwich is just 3 miles from Canterbury and has been offering rest to weary pilgrims for centuries. As a "Champing" church (short for church glamping) St Mary's provides beds and all the creature comforts to tourists and pilgrims with private access in return for a fixed charge. Booking in advance is essential.

The church itself is mellow and unspoilt, with seventeenth-century fittings and wall paintings. It is home to a strange carved stone, dating from around 1100. There are two pubs nearby, and a short walk takes you to nearby village Sturry for access to a village shop, trains and buses. Â
