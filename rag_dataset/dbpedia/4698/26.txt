The Fianna Fáil ethics committee is expected to discuss the fate of the beleaguered North Dublin TD, Mr GV Wright, either this evening or tomorrow.

Mr Wright has been accused by Mr Frank Dunlop of conspiring with him to mislead the Mahon tribunal.

Mr Dunlop also alleges he gave the former Senator £2,000 in 1993 to support a planning motion at Dublin County Council.

Mr Wright, who denies Mr Dunlop's allegations, is expected to give evidence to the tribunal next month.

He is also facing a drink-driving charge after he knocked down a woman pedestrian in Dublin on his way home from the Dáil.
