New York's arty, jazz-inflected rock five-piece New Wet Kojak formed in 1995, when Girls Against Boys members Scott McCloud and Johnny Temple recruited guitarist/engineer Geoff Turner (formerly of Grey Matter), drummer Nick Pelleciotto (a former member of Edsel) and saxophonist Charles Bennington, all of whom hailed from GVSB's hometown, Washington D.C. That year the group released their self-titled debut album on Touch & Go Records, and despite infrequent gigging and McCloud and Temple's commitment to Girls Against Boys, New Wet Kojak released their follow-up, International Nasty, in 1997. The group switched to Beggars Banquet for their third album, Do Things, which arrived in spring 2000.
