The world of film changed forever on May 16, 1929, when the first Oscars were awarded â€” and, fun fact, they weren't even called Oscars back then (the name was officially adopted in 1934). Today, many years later, we still look to the Oscars, or Academy Awards, to point us towards the very best films each year.

Have you ever wondered which Oscar Best Picture winner from our list landed the prestigious title the year you were born? We've compiled a list of every winner in that category from the past 95 years! Honestly, we want to watch them all.
