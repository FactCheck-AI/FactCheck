Early Origins of the Grose family

The surname Grose was first found in Cornwall where the first record of the family was found in "Trescobays, or Triscobays, [which] was formerly inherited by the family of Grosse; after which it was purchased by Sir Peter Killigrew, together with the barton of Howard as a parcel of Tregangy." 2

"During [the reign of Elizabeth] four-fifths [of the manor of Rosmoddris] was granted to St. George Carye, and sold by him to Ezekiel Grosse, Esq. whose family had an ancient seat at Triclodevas in this parish." 2

"Leah or Leigh, [in the parish of St. Buryan, Cornwall] now occupied by a farmer, was anciently a seat of the Grosse family, and afterwards of the Usticks." 2

Not withstanding the Cornish origin of the name, some of the family may have originated elsewhere. By example, Willelmus filius grosse was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 in Suffolk. The same source also lists Willelmus Grossus in Norfolk. 3

Later in Yorkshire, Geraldus filius Grossi was listed there in the Pipe Rolls of 1176. Adam le Gros was listed at Holme in Norfolk 1186-1210 and Wiliam le Groos was listed in the Feet of Fines for Essex in 1314. 1
