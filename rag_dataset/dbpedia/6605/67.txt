Nightfall Games announce the StokerVerse RPG -

Nightfall Games is very pleased to announce that we have acquired the rights to produce and publish the ‘The StokerVerse RPG’ from Stoker & McAuley [...]

Nightfall Games is very pleased to announce that we have acquired the rights to produce and publish the 'The StokerVerse RPG' from Stoker & McAuley LLC

The StokerVerse is the exciting brainchild of international bestselling author Dacre Stoker, the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker and Chris McAuley, award winning artist, acclaimed writer and gaming expert. Stoker & McAuley LLC has set out last year to re-energise the Stoker Dracula IP and show the world the true, authentic depiction of what Bram, the creator of Dracula, had intended for his universe of horror through various modern interactive media.

The StokerVerse RPG will be launched on Kickstarter in 2022. Over the coming months, the writing and art teams at both Nightfall Games and Stoker & McAuley will be working closely together to bring this brilliant IP to the roleplaying table in the form of a 240 page tome. The game will feature Nightfall Games' S5S system (also seen in SLA Industries and The Terminator RPG) tailored specifically for the game and its nature. The book will be another example of Nightfall Games' core values of Quality Writing, Quality Art and Quality Production Values.

But before the Kickstarter, the free to download (from DrivethruRPG) Quickstart, Dracula's Revenge will be released. This will be the direct sequel to Bram Stoker's Dracula novel.

More at the link.

I've never heard it referred to as the 'StokerVerse' before this. It makes me think of the aborted Universal monster universe they tried to bring to the cinema.

I wonder what else is in the StokerVerse, besides Dracula. It sounds like something potentially worth checking out.

Can anyone here tell me anything about this S5S system?

The Stokerverse sounds a bit silly as a concept but I do love the original Dracula novel and Ken Russell's gonzo adaptation of The Lair of the White Worm.

The Jewel of Seven Stars also sounded fun enough that I picked up a copy to read.

Dacre Stoker seems like a fairly prolific author.

But uh, as with anything Nightfall do, my worry is whether they have the time and money to support this game line. They're still a fairly small company, they already have two fairly chunky lines in active development, and they've never exactly been fast. Hope they haven't bitten (Pun not intended) off more than they could chew here.

actually i'd buy a game or sourcebook based on Bit pretty much straight away. even if it was an s5s game.

Don't forget Bram Stoker's Burial of the Rats, brought to all it's skinemax glory in the 90's Roger Corman adaption with Adrienne Barbeau...

Unimpressed with their choice of system and their setting pitch.

Definitely impressed with the Roger Corman film featuring a scantily clad Adrienne Barbeau, which I should be viewing posthaste. For research purposes, of course.

It's the same system used in the new SLA Industries and Terminator. You can download a quick start at DTRPG

The only thing (I hesitate to call it a novel) I have read by Dacre Stoker (so distantly related to 'Bram that I think I'm closer), is Dracula the Un-dead.

It is the worst published book I have ever read. Just... Fucking... Shit.

While I can see Nightfall viewing this as an early buy-in to a potentially popular franchise (like Palladium Books lucked into TMNT before it shot right out of their price range), I can't fathom why anyone would buy the rights to publish public domain characters. I can absolutely see Wordforge/Nightfall wanting to broaden the company's range of products, but no way would I spend a half-penny on steampunk Dracula.

It would be like me writing an RPG about British colonial military campaigns in Africa and using the fact that I'm very, very, very distantly related to General Gordon of Khartoum as a selling point (true story - on about the same level as Dacre Stoker being the great grand nephew or whatever of the more famous Stoker).

This just seems like such a bizarre licence that absolutely nobody was crying out for. And I love this review quote from the Wiki page on Dacre Stoker ""tempting enough to read and bad enough to be controversial, striking a balance between sensationalism and mediocrity". That's cutting.

My uncle was Jeff Torrington (a faintly popular author from the Scottish side of my family), doesn't mean I should be following in his footsteps. My online posts prove that.

I love SLA Industries, and like the Nightfall guys who have been nothing but accommodating whenever I've spoken to them, but this holds no interest for me. I mean, I hope it works out... But man, who pays to make steampunk Dracula the role-playing game?

Same. When we talk about Nightfall in this context, we're talking about the company. Not really sure where the company Nightfall was detailed in Apocacthulhu? Even writing out that sentence makes no sense...

Steampunk? OK I'm out.

Yep, that was kind of my reaction as well.

Of Swing, Hammer, Swing fame? My grandmother loved that book, as she grew up in the Gorbals.

Yes indeed. He spent decades writing it. As a cheeky teenager I'd ask how far along he was every holiday we had up there. He already had Parkinson's Disease by the time I got to know him, but he was a good bloke and part of the great times I had in Scotland.

Misreading? Clearly, not reading the OP. At no point until your post was Apocathulhu mentioned, because it simply wasn't relevant. A simple scan of the OP would have indicated that it was about Nightfall Games producing an RPG base don Bram Stoker's writings. But, you wade in with a pompous "Nightfall if you recall was detailed in Apocathulhu". Read the damn OP.

Anyways, is there any reason to believe this Stokerverse will be Steampunk?

Is that because of the involvement of this descendent of Bram Stoker?

It seems he has enthusiasm for monetising a property which is in the public domain, by writing derivative works that leverage his tenuous connection to his more illustrious forebear. Dacre Stoker's works certainly seem to have more than a tinge of steampunk, which - given his involvement in the licence - might well bleed into the entire 'Stokerverse' thing.

Incidentally, when I was a teenager I began writing a sequel to Dracula - I think I got about 6 chapters in. It was about Lucy Westenra being brought back to life accidentally by graverobbers.

If you check the rather wobbly site for all this tomfoolery, there is concept art for steampunk Dracula. I think there might be multiple genres invovled, but didn't have the interest or patience to dig through the site further.

I mis-read the OP, and on the grounds it 30 degrees on Sunday that is understandable.

There is simply no need for your post, none whatsoever.

Sounds like a great premise. Could make for a cool Hammer style sequel.

Well if they are sticking with Bram Stoker's description of Dracula, then he needs to have a moustache like in the books.

Most of the film adaptions since Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee have the villain as clean shaven

(Christopher Lee did eventually portray Dracula with a moutstache, although it wasn't for Hammer films)

IIRC he was also able to walk around in daylight...? I should re-read it sometime, it's a really cool book.

Bram's Dracula was able to be out during the day, but he lost some of his powers when doing it. His brides could not however, as far as I remember. Been years since I last read the book.

Can anyone here tell me anything about this S5S system?

Lair of the White Worm, but it's um... all I'm going to say is that doing Dracula as a diary really helped cover up some of the flaws in Stoker's writing style.
