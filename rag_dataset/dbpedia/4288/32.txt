"Assuming that the comet [1997 K2] followed a fairly normal light

curve it is reasonable to suppose that to the search programs it

would be 4 magnitudes fainter than indicated by visual

observations and would follow an inverse square law for

brightness. It is fairly easy to calculate where the comet would

be and how bright it might be, although the orbit is not highly

accurate. The comet would probably have been visible from the

LINEAR site from January to May 1998 when it was probably brighter

than 19th magnitude. The search plots on the LINEAR web site

suggest that the likely area through which the comet passed was

searched. It was therefore presumably fainter than the detection

limit at the time."

Equatorial water may have provided means of survival for early life

Sudden warming trends melted ice, providing refuge for multi-celled

animals while the rest of the Earth was frozen

By Janet Wong

May 24, 2000 -- The precursor of modern animals may have been able to

survive a Snowball Earth era that occurred some 600 million years ago

because of a belt of open water along the equator, suggests scientists

from the University of Toronto and Texas A&M University. This was a

time considered critical in the evolutionary development of

multi-celled animals and therefore the most important interval for

biological evolution in general.

In a paper to be published in the May 25 edition of Nature, U of T

physics professor Richard Peltier and Texas A&M oceanographers William

Hyde, Thomas Crowley and Steven Baum note that the late Proterozoic era

(600-800 million years ago) was the most important period of evolution

for multi-cellular creatures. However, this period was also a time in

Earth's history that has come to be referred to as the Snowball Earth.

At that time, the planet was thought to be completely ice-covered.

Geological and paleomagnetic evidence indicates that for alternating

periods, the Earth was completely covered by ice sheets over the

continents and sea ice over the oceans, followed by sudden warming

trends that melted the ice.

"If the suface of the planet was covered by ice, the question arises as

to how early life managed to survive under such environmental stress,"

says Peltier. To find an answer, the scientists employed several

different models of the climate systems and ran detailed computer

simulations of the climate thought to have been characteristic of that

time. To simulate the Snowball Earth, they reduced the amount of

sunlight reaching the Earth -- to account for the fact that the sun was

about six per cent less luminous than it is now -- and varied the

concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide within the range expected

for that time.

In most of the simulations, their analysis revealed the presence of a

belt of open water near the equator when the general circulation of the

ocean was taken into account. "It is this open water that may have

provided a refuge for multi-celled animals when the rest of the Earth

was covered by ice and snow," Peltier explains.

The findings of this research are critical to understanding how early

life evolved, he states. "This could help clarify how multi-celled

animals managed not only stay alive, but to thrive given the Earth's

harsh conditions. The extreme climates may even have exerted pressure

on these animals to evolve and adapt, possibly leading to the rapid

development of new forms of animals and their movement into new,

unpopulated habitats when the Earth exited the snowball state. It was

during the warm Cambrian era -- immediately following the late

Proterozoic -- in which life proliferated."

The late Proterozoic period was also a time when the supercontinents

Rodinia and Pannotia formed and subsequently rifted and disassembled.

Located over the south rotational pole in the position of present-day

Antarctica, these supercontinents were made up of the current land

masses of Africa, South America, Antarctica, Australia, Greenland,

Laurentia and parts of Asia. According to Peltier, the entry of the

Earth into the snowball state required not only the weak sun and

atmospheric carbon dioxide levels not significantly higher than

present-day, but also this high degree of polar continentality.

Funding for this research came from the Natural Sciences and

Engineering Research Council of Canada and the National Science

Foundation in the U.S.

*) UNIVERSITY OF THESSALONIKI,DEPT PHYS,SECT ASTROPHYS ASTRON &

In this paper, we examine the dynamical evolution of the asteroid

(1868) Thersites(1), a member of the Trojan belt. Thersites is

librating around the Lagrangian point L-4, following, however, a

chaotic orbit. The equations of motion for Thersites as well as for a

distribution of neighboring initial conditions are integrated

numerically for 50 million years in the Outer Solar System model (OSS),

which consists of the Sun and the four giant planets. Our results

indicate that the probability that this asteroid will eventually escape

from the Trojan swarm is rather high. In fact, 20% from our initial

distribution escaped within the integration time. Many of the remaining

ones also show characteristic 'jumps' in the orbital elements,

especially the inclination. Secular resonances involving the nodes of

the outer planets are found to be responsible for this chaotic

behavior. The width of libration and eccentricity values that lead to

grossly unstable orbits are calculated and compared with previously

known results on the stability of the Trojans. Finally, a very

interesting behavior has been observed for one of the escaping

asteroids as he 'jumped' from L-4 to L-5 where he remained performing a

highly inclined libration for similar to 2 Myrs before escaping from

the Trojan swarm. Copyright 2000, Institute for Scientific Information

*) YORK UNIVERSITY,DEPT PHYS & ASTRON,N YORK,ON M3J 1P3,CANADA

Quasi satellites are bodies in a particular configuration of a 1:1 mean

motion resonance, one in which they librate about the longitude of

their associated planet. We investigate numerically the stability of

such orbits around the giant planets of our solar system. We find that

test particles can remain on quasi-satellite orbits around Uranus and

Neptune for times up to 10(9) yr in some cases, though only at low

inclinations relative to their accompanying planet and over a

restricted range of heliocentric eccentricities. These stable areas are

well outside the traditional satellite region. Based on these results,

we conclude that a primordial population of such objects may still

exist in our solar system. Copyright 2000, Institute for Scientific

Interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) collected in the Earth's

stratosphere and meteorites are fragments of comets and asteroids.

These are 'primitive' meteorites in part because they have preserved

materials which predate the formation of the Solar System. The most

primitive (least altered) meteorites contain a few parts per million of

micrometre-sized dust which formed in the atmospheres of giant

stars(1). Some meteorites(2) have elevated D/H and N-15/N-14 ratios

that are attributed to surviving interstellar organic molecules which

have probably been strongly diluted and altered by parent-body

processes(2). Most IDPs are chemically, mineralogically, and texturally

primitive in comparison to meteorites(3,4). Here I show that H and N

isotopic anomalies among fragile 'cluster' IDPs are far larger, more

common, and less equilibrated than those previously observed in other

IDPs or meteorites. In some cases, the D/H ratios that we measure reach

the values of interstellar molecules, suggesting that molecular-cloud

material has survived intact. These observations indicate that cluster

IDPs are the most primitive class of Solar System materials currently

available for laboratory analysis. Copyright 2000, Institute for

This paper explores two processes, sweeping secular resonance (Ward,

1981) and gas drag (Lecar and Franklin, 1997), at work during the

dispersal of the solar nebula. We have two aims not previously

considered for the two mechanisms: (1) to explain the likely depletion,

by a factor of 1000 or so, of the rocky material in the inner belt (2.0

< a < 3.2 AU); (2) to introduce a means for providing-or contributing

to-the dispersion in semimajor axis of the various asteroidal taxonomic

classes. We suggest that large asteroids with birthplaces separated by

an astronomical unit or more can be finally deposited, owing to drag,

at the same semimajor axis. For example, we find that bodies with radii

up to 100 km can be transferred by gas drag from the outer belt (a >

3.3 AU) well into the inner one, and that an object already in the

inner belt as large or even larger than Vesta (r = 250 km)-thought to

be the parent body of many meteorites-can be inwardly displaced by as

much as an astronomical unit if the nebula dispersal times lie close to

10(5) years. For such times, a large fraction of the inner belt's

primordial mass can be ejected, with most of it passing into the inner

solar system. Copyright 2000, Institute for Scientific Information Inc.

In the framework of an observational campaign for increasing the

knowledge on the relationship between cometary nuclei and asteroids, we

performed spectroscopic observations of P/Gehrels 3. The Jupiter family

comet P/Gehrels 3 moves on a particular orbit, with a very high

Tisserand invariant with respect to Jupiter, that makes the encounters

with the planet very effective. This implies that the comet spends part

of its life as a temporary satellite of Jupiter, on an orbit that shows

similarity with those of Trojans. This comet has been observed when it

was far from the Sun, with the aim to acquire data on the nucleus

status. In order to study from a theoretical point of view the possible

status and evolution of a body on this orbit we have developed

different nucleus models using a numerical code for the thermal

evolution of the nucleus. Copyright 2000, Institute for Scientific

(7) U.S. DEFENDS MISSILE SHIELD, BUT SOME EUROPEAN ALLIES

REMAIN SKEPTICAL

From SpaceDaily, 24 May 2000

http://www.spacedaily.com/news/bmdo-00zd.html

US Defends Missile Shield, But Europe Skeptical

Florence (AFP) May 24, 2000 - The United States defended its plans for

an anti-missile defense shield Wednesday at the NATO foreign ministers'

meeting, but some European allies remained skeptical.

US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told her peers that the

National Missile Defense (NMD) system -- now under development -- was

essential for US security.

"The ballistic missile threat from states of concern is growing and

real," she said, alluding most notably to North Korea. "And the dangers

posed by all weapons of mass destruction must be dealt with firmly and

cooperatively."

She insisted that the NMD system, if it goes ahead, will not result in

a reduction to the United States' "enduring commitment" to the North

Atlantic Treaty Organization.

"We look forward to continuing our consultations with you (about the

anti-missile system) on a regular basis," she said.

But French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said: "Questions need to be

asked about the reality and scale of the threats (prompting such an

anti-missile shield), the technical credibility of the project and its

strategic consequences."

German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told reporters: "The US

anti-missile shield plan must be put within the bigger framework of a

new initiative on disarmament."

Russia strongly opposes the US plan, which will require changes to the

anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty that Washington signed with the

former Soviet Union in 1972.

At a press conference later Wednesday, Albright said the National

Missile Defense system was not directed at Moscow, "and they need to

absorb that lesson."

Among NATO allies, she added, "there seems to be an understanding of

where we are going and some gratitude, I guess, that we are having very

frequent briefings on this."

From Jeffrey Larsen <jlarsen@pirlmail.lpl.Arizona.EDU>

Benny,

I understand Jon's point, I guess the point I'm trying to make is that

the process of developing a practical detection network is either

iterative (at which we are progressing as fast as possible) or very

expensive. I think several groups are preparing to trade sky coverage

for fainter limiting magnitude. But a case study from three years ago

doesn't properly critique the surveys as they exist today...

Benny

While I can understand that you would find it hard to let pass any

opportunity not to castigate the running dogs of JPL and their

chapmanite lackeys, it seems only fair to point out that fifth on the

NRC want-list comes the Large Aperture Synoptic Survey Telescope. As

Tony Reichhardt points out in Nature today, this instrument is widely

applicable to all sorts of surveys (it has a 3 degree field)

including earth crossers down to 300 metres. An analysis of various

real and potential survey instruments by Alain Maury

(http://wwwrc.obs-azur.fr/schmidt/general/NEOsurvey.html) seems to

rate LSST (then known as DMT) far higher than any other project.

While originally conceived as a way of looking for dark matter effects

(hence the original name dark matter telescope) LSST's interests have

been broadened recently (concievably as a way of broadening its

supporting constituency) to include, among a couple of other things,

NEO searches. Given this, if built it will presumably have to serve

these new constituents (the website points to support from Carolyn

Shoemaker). I suppose its possible that all this looks good on paper

but that those in the know know that, in practice, this is not great

news for NEO watchers. If so let them speak up. At first blush it looks

pretty good.

You could argue -- I might argue -- that LSST should be higher up the

list, above the new X ray telescopes and the expansion to the VLA. But

lists like this have to balance the interests of the different

spectrum-communities. The fact that this survey instrument, with

great potential use for NEO searches, is the second most highly rated

optical project seems a pretty high endorsement to me.

---------------

MODERATOR'S NOTE: I share Olivers hope that one of the telescopes

mentioned on the $3.7 billion U.S. wish-list might, sometime in the

future, be also used for NEO searches. But that's not the point. What I

(and others) have criticised is the assertion by some that additional

telescopes are actually unnecessary to achieve the current Spaceguard

goals. As was pointed out on CCNet (14 March 2000), the U.S. Congress

and NASA have adopted the goal of the Spaceguard Survey (i.e. finding

90% of NEAs larger than 1 km diameter in the next 10 years). It follows

that if "a modest extension" of the current search programmes can

actually meet this goal, there is no reason why tight-fisted funding

agencies (not just those in the U.S.) should contribute to *additional*

search programmes that would appear entirely superfluous in this light.

In the past, many observers have lamented that the number of

professional NEO searchers around the world are "less than the staff at

a typical McDonalds". As far as the Spaceguard goals are concerned, it

would appear that this is all it takes to manage the impact hazard. Or

is it?

There indeed is a major ongoing debate, largely out of public view,

on the sustainability of traditional hydrocarbon-based energy sources

beyond the next decade. A leading proponent of the pessimistic view

is Dr. Colin Campbell, whose opinions may be accessed on the Internet

at www.oilcrisis.com <http://www.oilcrisis.com>.

More optimistic views are also available on the Internet. One such

view is "The Increasing Sustainability of Conventional Energy," by

Robert L. Bradley, available at

http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa-341es.html

Why might this be of importance to readers of CCNet? Well, nearly

all fertilizer is made from petroleum products, and if most of us

will die of starvation long before the next major impact event, then

money spent on Spaceguard may be irrelevant.

By the way, I count myself as an optimist on this particular issue.

Velikovsky. The Macmillan Company ($4.50). Scientists consider

Velikovsky's laborious theory that 3,500 years ago a great comet

(14) AND FINALLY: RUINS ALTER IDEAS OF HOW CIVILIZATION SPREAD

From The New York Times, 23 May 2000

http://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/052300sci-archaeo-syria.html

By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD

In the northeastern corner of Syria, near the Iraqi border and within

sight of southern Turkey's Taurus Mountains, archaeologists have begun

excavations of an ancient settlement that lay on a major trade route

from Nineveh to Aleppo. The ruins from more than 5,500 years ago are

telling them that previous ideas about the spread of early civilization

were more than likely wrong.

The first trenches cut into the large 500-acre site, Tell Hamoukar,

have yielded strong evidence that centrally administered complex

societies in northern regions of the Middle East apparently arose

simultaneously but independently of the more celebrated city-states of

southern Mesopotamia, in what is now southern Iraq. In the

conventional view, civilization was thought to begin solely in the

south and then move north through trade and colonization.

In an announcement of the new finds, Dr. McGuire Gibson, an

archaeologist at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago,

said, "We need to reconsider our ideas about the beginnings of

civilization, pushing the time further back."

Other archaeologists familiar with the research agreed in interviews

last week that the Tell Hamoukar excavations confirmed and should

elaborate on a consensus that has emerged among scholars in the last

decade about the role of northern settlements in Syria and Iraq and in

southeastern Turkey in the development of civilization. These

settlements exhibited many of the attributes of civilization --

monumental architecture, division of labor, social stratification --

apparently before they had any significant contact with people in the

lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.

"It's a very important excavation," said Dr. Gil J. Stein, an

archaeologist at Northwestern University. "It fits in really nicely

with a picture that's been emerging, based on several other excavation

sites."

Even Dr. Guillermo Algaze, an archaeologist at the University of

California at San Diego, who had argued for a south-to-north

transplantation of early civilization, said that he now generally

agreed with the new interpretation. "I've been eating a lot of crow

lately," he said.

Excavations at Tell Hamoukar were started last summer by a joint

expedition of the Oriental Institute and the Syrian Directorate General

of Antiquities. Work will resume next month and will probably continue

for many years. The site promises an abundance of artifacts,

archaeologists said, not only because of its large size but also

because most of the material seems to be close to the surface.

Digging into the oldest layer of ruins uncovered so far, archaeologists

found traces of people living in villages at the site as early as 4000

B.C.

Within 300 years, the settlement had grown into a prosperous town of at

least 32 acres with ample evidence of a well-organized society of the

kind associated with the early stages of civilization.
