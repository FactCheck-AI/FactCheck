Boulder-based Newton Running has laid off a number of its staff in a restructuring that follows a change in leadership at the top.

Founder and CEO Jerry Lee stepped down on Oct. 1.

Lee, who remains chairman of the board, said in a prepared statement at the time that he stepped down to spend more time with his family. Taking his place was Joe O’Neil, a 30-year footwear industry veteran who most recently was senior vice president of Quiksilver Inc.-owned footwear brand DC Shoes.

Quiksilver filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early September.

O’Neil confirmed the terminations Monday, saying Newton went through a “level of restructuring” that included eliminating some positions.

“We’re just taking a look at the business and the requirements of the business,” O’Neil said. “We’re still here, we love Boulder, we’ve got a passionate following, and we’re going to continue maximizing value.”

Industry sources said 18 people lost their jobs, including a number of sales and tech reps and the company’s vice president of finance. O’Neil would not confirm either the number of terminations or positions affected.

The current number of employees also couldn’t be confirmed, but a LinkedIn profile for Newton Running shows that they have between 51 and 200 employees.

A WARN notice was not filed with the Department of Labor, which is generally required of companies with 100 or more full-time employees if the layoff affects more than 33 percent of the active workforce.

Newton, a privately held company, is majority owned by and Lee and Boston-based Fireman Capital Partners, led by Reebok founder Paul Fireman. Fireman made a $20 million minority share investment in Newton Running in 2011.
