Boulder’s Newton Running has closed its store on the Pearl Street Mall two years after moving it from 1300 Walnut St.

A sign is up at the 1222 Pearl St. storefront announcing the closure, and workers in nearby offices said the store closed abruptly last week. The retail space is otherwise undisturbed: products still sit on the shelf and window displays remain untouched.

A spokesperson for Newton declined comment and said the company would be releasing details about the closure next week.

Newton is privately owned by founder Jerry Lee and Boston-based Fireman Capital Partners, which made a $20 million minority investment in the company in 2011.

Fireman also has a stake in Longmont’s Oskar Blues. Officials there did not respond to a request for comment.

Stephen Tebo, who owns the space, declined comment, but did confirm that Newton retains a lease on the property.

Newton moved into the 3,300-square-foot space formerly occupied by the now-bankrupt GoLite in late Februrary 2015. Co-founder Danny Abshire told the Camera at the time the move would expose the niche brand, founded in 2007, to a larger consumer base.

It also allowed Newton more room, being nearly twice as large as its previous retail space. The store began selling apparel and other athletic gear.

There have been few details surrounding the recent retail closure, even among the small, local sporting goods community, said Henry Guzman, owner of south Boulder’s Flatirons Running.

“Literally it’s silent,” Guzman said. “There’s been no rumbles, which is odd.”

In October 2015, the company laid off an unknown number of staff in a restructuring. Lee also stepped down as CEO, retaining his position as chairman of the board. Lee was replaced by Joe O’Neil, former senior vice president of the now-bankrupt Quicksilver.

At the time, O’Neil told the Camera the brand would “continue maximizing value.”
