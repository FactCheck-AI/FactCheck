The Three Lions will wear commemorative warm-up shirts before the 150th anniversary heritage match against Scotland at Hampden Park.

England and Scotlandâs goalless draw on 30 November 1872 was footballâs first international match. In celebration of that historic meeting, the two nations will go head-to-head in Glasgow to mark 150 years of international football and one of the sportâs oldest rivalries.

Before kick-off, the England players will warm up in a unique shirt â a modern replica of the kit worn for the inaugural match. It is a classic, all-white jersey, branded with the original Three Lions crest. Beneath the badge, â1872â is stitched in navy blue.

Instead of selling the shirts, a limited number will be auctioned to raise money for the FAâs official charity partner, Alzheimerâs Society. The auction is live and will close at 8pm on 30 September.
