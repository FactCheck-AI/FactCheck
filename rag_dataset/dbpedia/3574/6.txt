the most troublesome of the family to figure out

Jedidiah Fitch was the eldest surviving son of Major James Fitch and Elizabeth Mason Fitch. He is the most troublesome of the family to figure out. All his brothers were soldiers fighting Indians and such. As a young teenager, Jed moved to the north shore of Massachusetts and settled in Newbury, and then later went to Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts. Nantucket was a Quaker colony at the time and in 1701 he married into an established Quaker family. His father had been quite friendly with the local Indians, the Mohegans and Pequots, yet fought against other tribes. Perhaps Jedediah became a pacifist and wanted no part of fighting the Indians he grew up with and so left for Nantucket. Perhaps he

simply wanted to go to sea. (Pullman)
