Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1685; alive 9 May 1755) of New London County, CT and Middlesex Co., NJ

by Charles M. Ward, Jr.

Daniel Fitch was born about the year 1685, the illegitimate son of Captain Daniel Fitch (1665-1711), of the North Parish of New London, Connecticut (now Montville, CT).The identity of his mother is unknown.He was a grandson of the Reverend James Fitch (1622-1702), a founder of Norwich, Connecticut, and his second wife, Priscilla (Mason) Fitch.

The circumstances surrounding the birth of Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1685) are referenced in the “Diary of Joshua Hempstead, of New London, Connecticut,” page 648.In a diary entry dated Friday, 9 May 1755, he wrote:

“…Mr Daniel Fitch aged near 70 & lives at new Brunswick came to See me.he hath been gone from thes parts 45 year, he is an Illegitimate Son of Capt Daniel Fitch late of the north Parish Decd…”

It’s possible the visit Daniel Fitch made to Connecticut was due to an illness of his much younger brother, Deacon Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1709).The Hempstead diary notes the death of Deacon Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1709) on Monday, 12 May 1755.Deacon Daniel Fitch was the legitimate son of Captain Daniel Fitch by his wife, Mary Sherwood.The brothers bore the same given name, a fact which has caused confusion on the part of some researchers.They should not be confused, especially as there was some twenty-four years separating their births.

The Hempstead diary entry indicates Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1685) left Connecticut for New Jersey around the year 1710.This is confirmed by New Jersey records.Daniel Fitch married Sarah Carle, 20 Jan 1712 in Piscataway, Middlesex Co., NJ.Sarah Carle was the widow of Benjamin Carle.She was born 27 Sep 1678, the daughter of Benjamin Hull and Rachel (York) Hull and granddaughter of the Reverend Joseph Hull.She had married Benjamin Carle, 4 Feb 1696/7.Benjamin Carle and Sarah (Hull) Carle had at least two children whose births are recorded in the Piscataway Register of Births:Rosanna Carle, born 13 Jul 1698; and John Carle, born 27 Dec 1700.There may have been others, including a possible son, Benjamin.

Administration on the estate of Benjamin Carle was granted to Daniel Fitch and his wife, Sarah, on 8 Sep 1713.

Daniel and Sarah (Hull) Fitch had four children and their births are recorded in the Piscataway Register of Births:

Daniel Fitch, born 7 Nov 1713

Joseph Fitch, born 6 Apr 1715

James Fitch, born 27 Mar 1717

Samuel Fitch, born 16 Jan 1719

Following the birth of the youngest child, Daniel Fitch settled in New Brunswick, Middlesex Co., New Jersey a short distance from Piscataway, across the Raritan River.It is in New Brunswick, New Jersey that this Fitch family can be found in 1752 in the “List of the Freeholders of Middlesex County, N.J.” compiled by William Deare, Sheriff, on 14 Dec 1752.Daniel Fitch, Jun., James Fitch, and Samuel Fitch are listed (Joseph Fitch is not listed).Although the elder Daniel Fitch is not named, it’s very likely he was residing with one of his sons, especially since the younger Daniel Fitch is identified as “Daniel Fitch, Jun.”This designation would not have been necessary if there wasn’t another older Daniel Fitch residing in the area.We also know that Daniel Fitch was alive as late as 9 May 1755 based on the Hempstead diary entry of that date in which he is referred to as being a resident of New Brunswick.

Samuel Fitch, the youngest son of Daniel Fitch and Sarah (Hull) Fitch, was married to Jane Johnson, 19 Jan 1739 (license), both described as being of Middlesex Co., NJ.As previously mentioned, Samuel Fitch is found residing in New Brunswick, Middlesex Co., NJ on 14 Dec 1752 in the list of freeholders.He is listed not far from his father-in-law, William Johnson.Jane (Johnson) Fitch was the daughter of William Johnson and Jannetje (Wyckoff) Johnson (see my posting on her family:http://genforum.genealogy.com/johnson/messages/34877.html)http://genforum.genealogy.com/johnson/messages/34877.html).Samuel Fitch left New Jersey and settled in Berkeley Co., VA (now WV), dying 15 Dec 1800.He left numerous descendants.

An exact death date for Daniel Fitch (b.ca 1685) has not been ascertained and research is ongoing.
