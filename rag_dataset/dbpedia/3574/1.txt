Notes for MARY EVERITT FITCH:

Per the 1910 Federal Census, Mary lived with her sister Elizabeth and her husband, James B. Fulkerson in Dryden.

According to the 1860 census which was dated June 19, 1860, Mary was 8 years old. She would have to have been born in 1852 rather than 1853 as my records indicate. They would have just celebrated her birthday.
