1985 Akira Kurosawa film Ran (乱) at Row House Cinema, from December 26.

The 1985 Akira Kurosawa film Ran (乱) will play at the Row House Cinema from December 26 through January 5, 2023. A 2010 Washington Post review summarizes:

Based on Shakespeare's "King Lear" and set in 16th-century feudal Japan, Akira Kurosawa's 1985 antiwar epic is almost over the top with betrayal, battle and blood. At times, the red stuff flows like paint from the brush of Jackson Pollock. It's an angry and expressive spurt of pigment, emblematic of the director's rage -- the title is the Japanese character for "chaos" or "fury" -- and not a realistic body fluid.

Tickets are available online. The single-screen theater is located at 4115 Butler Street in Lawrenceville (map).
