Transpacific Sound Paradise Playlist Saturday, June 30, 2001

"Africa unplugged" is a theme we will return to periodically.

Many African and especially Congolese artists have recently begun getting back to their roots

by recording acoustic or semi-acoustic tracks or even (Fan Fan for example) entire albums.

This show features such new back-to-the-roots efforts as well as archival tracks -

and also a couple of intriguing "ringers".

The show opens with a piece by the great Camerounian / Parisian composer / performer

Francis Bebey, who passed away earlier this year, and is dedicated to his memory. Clickhereto hear this show.
