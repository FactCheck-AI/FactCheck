Biography

Dr. Paul Nguyen is a Medical Educator at Monash University, member of the Developmental Disabilities Special Interest Group at the Royal College of General Practitioners and a former Developmental Disability Medical Specialist for the Centre for Developmental Disability Health Victoria. During his time as a GP, he focussed mainly on mental health, including practising clinical hypnotherapy, and Focussed Psychological Strategies (predominantly focussing on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy). Paul identifies as a secular Buddhist and a flexitarian, which demonstrates his refusal to be easily categorised, a trait that has given him the empathy and experience to provide care for people whose needs are neither simple nor uniform.
