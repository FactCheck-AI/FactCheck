Spectrasonics today has announced the highly anticipated release of Stylus RMX™ – Realtime Groove Module. Stylus RMX is a completely new groove-based virtual instrument plug-in for Macintosh and Windows. Stylus RMX is the first product to offer the combined power of Groove Control™ with Spectrasonics Advanced Groove Engine (S.A.G.E.™) technology giving users dramatic new control over groove production and performance.

“The release of Stylus RMX is a very exciting moment in Spectrasonics’ ten year history,” said Eric Persing, Spectrasonics’ Founder and Creative Director. “Stylus RMX is the culmination of so many dreams we’ve had for a world-class groove machine. The new S.A.G.E. technology makes it simple to use and extremely powerful, all at the same time. The creative synergy of our sound design and software development teams has produced an instrument that has enormous musical potential and we think our customers will find it inspiring for many years to come.”

Spectrasonics’ in-house development team created the new instrument from the ground up, with dozens of new features including the ground-breaking Chaos Designer™, a completely redesigned, multi-page user interface, a new core library of sounds, all with a focus on realtime groove creation and performance.

New Core library

The massive new 7.4 gigabyte core-library in Stylus RMX has thousands of cutting-edge grooves and sounds that were created by Spectrasonics’ international sound design team, and produced by Eric Persing. The new core library contains nearly triple the amount of sounds originally offered in the original Stylus, and contains all the original material as well. The new sounds and grooves in Stylus RMX offer a much wider range of modern musical genres than the original Stylus. Mixes of grooves are broken down into individual tracks called Elements for flexibility and infinite

combinations.

Also new in Stylus RMX are thousands of new Kit modules, as well as user Kit construction. The new sound menus have over 10,000 new single hits, all arranged in organized categories. Users can create their own customized multitrack remix grooves and kits, save them into the plug-in, and even share them with other Stylus RMX users on different platforms and hosts. It’s the ultimate Remix-oriented sound module for building grooves.

“Xpandable”

Stylus RMX marks Spectrasonics’ first expandable virtual instrument, with a series of five new “S.A.G.E. Xpanders” for Stylus RMX at $99US retail each. Stylus RMX also can be expanded with existing Groove Control CD-ROM libraries and even REX files – which opens the door for musicians to utilize their own audio loops within the powerful S.A.G.E. Environment.

Chaos Designer™

Of the many new capabilities in Stylus RMX, possibly the most innovative feature is the Chaos Designer™. With simple controls, the user can introduce musical Chaos into the groove, which allows it to have constantly evolving variations— giving the impression that the audio grooves are improvising. The results can be subtle or extreme by setting the simple to use controls. A Capture feature allows the spontaneous audio chaos patterns to be made into a MIDI file, dragged and dropped into the host sequencer, and played back again for further editing by the user.

On Chaos Designer Spectrasonics’ Persing notes, “Chaos Designer opens up a new world of possibilities compared to standard loop software. The one thing everyone likes about loops is that they are inspiring, but no one likes that the loop always sounds exactly the same every time it plays. Live musicians are always adding subtle variations in a performance to make it breathe. With Chaos Designer, you get an inspiring, improvising loop that changes — a little or a lot. It will never sound the same, unless you want it to. And now it’s easy to achieve in Stylus RMX.”
