IC 603 is a Barred Spiral Galaxy in the Sextans constellation. IC 603 is situated close to the celestial equator and, as such, it is at least partly visible from both hemispheres in certain times of the year. Given its B magnitude of 14.5, IC 603 is visible with the help of a telescope having an aperture of 20 inches (500mm) or more.

The image below is a photograph of IC 603 from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 (DSS2 - see the credits section) taken in the red channel. The area of sky represented in the image is 0.5000x0.5000 degrees (30.00x30.00 arcmins).
