NGC 2974 is a Elliptical Galaxy in the Sextans constellation. NGC 2974 is situated close to the celestial equator and, as such, it is at least partly visible from both hemispheres in certain times of the year. Given its B magnitude of 12.19, NGC 2974 is visible with the help of a telescope having an aperture of 8 inches (200mm) or more.

The image below is a photograph of NGC 2974 from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 (DSS2 - see the credits section) taken in the red channel. The area of sky represented in the image is 0.5000x0.5000 degrees (30.00x30.00 arcmins).
