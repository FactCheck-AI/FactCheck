Friends--

We are pleased to publish our latest catalog:

Catalog 188

Rare and Important Titles in Jewish Bibliography and Reference.

Included in this catalog are many titles from the private collection of leading Jewish bibliographer Joshua Bloch (1907-1957). Bloch headed the Jewish Division of New York Public Library for 33 years, founded and edited the Journal of Jewish Bibliography, and, himself, authored a number of important works.

As always, every item is offered subject to prior sale and is 100% returnable for any reason. Shipping is charged at cost.

All prices are in US Dollars. We prefer payment by credit card, but we also accept checks in US funds or www.paypal.com. We will also gladly invoice your institution; institutions may even delay payment until your next funding cycle begins.
