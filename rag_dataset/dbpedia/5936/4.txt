The Government has refused to intervene in the running of the North London Waste Authority (NLWA), despite a call from former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith.

Duncan Smith last June lobbied communities secretary Michael Gove to intervene to stop the NLWA’s Edmonton energy-from-waste plant project (pictured), which is near to his Chingford constituency. Gove asked his officials to examine the NLWA’s arrangements for decision-making, including governance, scrutiny and external audit.

The authority said Gove has now refused to intervene, and said in a letter to chief executive Martin Capstick that his department “will not be taking any further action at this time”.

Gove did, however, welcome the NLWA’s decision to ask the Local Government Association to undertake a corporate peer challenge - a process where experts from other councils and waste authorities will examine the NLWA and make any recommendations for change.

Capstick said: “The NLWA is careful to follow its statutory responsibilities and comply with its statutory duties. This letter confirms that to be the case.”

UK Without Incineration national co-ordinator Shlomo Dowen said Gove’s decision “does absolutely nothing to reassure concerned residents regarding the current status of the proposed Edmonton incinerator rebuild in relation to the scheme's failure to deliver value for money, nor in relation to the scheme's adverse climate impacts, adverse impacts on air quality and harm to recycling and the circular economy”.
