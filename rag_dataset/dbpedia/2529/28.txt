Approximately 21.5 million individuals were impacted by the cyber incident involving background investigation records OPM announced in 2015. Approximately 4.2 million individuals were impacted by the separate but related cyber incident involving personnel records OPM announced in 2015. Most of those people were also impacted by the cyber incident involving background investigations records; approximately 600,000 individuals were impacted only by the cyber incident involving personnel records.

If you received a notification letter and 25-digit PIN code from the Office of Personnel Management, we have determined that your Social Security number and other personal information were compromised in the 2015 cyber incidents.

We are offering you a comprehensive suite of credit and identity monitoring, identity theft insurance, and identity restoration services. We are also offering your dependent minor children, who were under the age of 18 as of July 1, 2015, identity monitoring, identity theft insurance, and identity restoration services.

Identity monitoring

Identity monitoring services include monitoring internet and database sources including those pertaining to criminal records, arrest records, bookings, court records, pay day loans, bank accounts, checks, sex offenders, changes of address, and Social Security number traces.

Identity restoration services

If your identity is compromised, representatives from the service provider will work with you to take steps to restore your identity. You and your dependent minor children have access to this benefit at any time during the coverage period without having to enroll in monitoring services; however, to utilize the restoration services, impacted individuals will need to verify that they are eligible to access services with the service provider.

Identity theft insurance

Identity theft insurance is being provided to impacted individuals and their dependent minor children regardless of whether they enroll in monitoring services. For those whose data were impacted by the background investigation records incident, identity theft insurance became effective on September 1, 2015. For those whose data were impacted by the personnel records incident, identity theft insurance became effective on December 2, 2016. The insurance covers all incidents of identity theft that occur during the coverage period, regardless of the source. It also covers you for expenses incurred in restoring your identity, with no deductible.

If you have received a notification letter and PIN code from OPM, please enroll with the service provider.

How You May Be Affected

If you underwent a Federal background investigation in 2000 or afterwards (which occurs through the submission of forms SF-86, SF-85, or SF-85P for either a new investigation or a reinvestigation), it is highly likely that you were impacted by the incident involving background investigations. If you underwent a background investigation prior to 2000, you still may have been impacted, but it is less likely. Current or former Federal employees may also have been impacted by the separate but related incident involving personnel records.
