Tapulous has submitted Tap Tap Revenge 3 to Apple for App Store approval, according to BusinessInsider.

Tap Tap Revenge 3 is a tribute to rhythm games like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero. The latest release allows in-app purchase of avatars and a growing library of songs from famous artists. Revenue from song sales -- two tracks for $0.99, or six tracks for $2.99 -- is split between Apple, Tapulous, and the labels.

Screenshots purporting to be of Tap Tap Revenge 3 were leaked earlier this month.
