If it seemed to you that Devin Hester set a new NFL record on every one of his return touchdowns, well, you weren’t far off.

As I explained recently, Hester’s run to the NFL record book was a bit confusing in real time, as NFL broadcasts highlighted different Hester records with different names. Was it “the return record” or “the kick return record”? Was it the “punt and kick return record” or the “special teams record”? What did all of these records mean? And why did his missed field goal return in 2006 make this so much more confusing?

Hester famously scored 20 return touchdowns, and incredibly, he tied or broke a Bears or NFL record on all 20 of them. This does not count his Super Bowl touchdown, which also set records.

Eighteen of these were major franchise or league records, while two are obscure. The broadcasts noted a fair number of his records but used a range of terms, making it tricky for viewers, myself included, to get a handle on what record was what.

So here’s a look at Hester’s 20 return touchdowns and the Bears and NFL records that he tied or set on each of them. This article comes from Stathead.com and Pro Football Reference; all newspaper clips are from Newspapers.com while all screenshots are from Youtube.

Before we begin, here is a look at the NFL and Bears touchdown return records after the 2005 season, before Devin Hester entered the league:

For reference while you read, here are 14 of Devin Hester’s 20 return touchdowns, along with the Super Bowl return. The six that are missing (2006 Vikings, 2007 Broncos #1, 2007 Saints, 2010 Seahawks, 2010 Vikings, 2011 Vikings), I’ll put below in the appropriate spots.

#1 — 2006 Week 1, 84-yard punt return at Packers

Return count: 1st overall, 1st of the season, 1st punt return

Bears records tied:

Punt return touchdown in 1st career game, tied with Perry Jeter, 1956

Punt return touchdowns, season, rookie

Special teams touchdown in 1st career game, tied with Perry Jeter, 1956, and George McAfee, 1940 (KR)

#2 — 2006 Week 6, 83-yard punt return at Cardinals

Return count: 2nd overall, 2nd of the season, 2nd punt return of career/season

New Bears record:

Punt return touchdowns, season, rookie

Bears records tied:

Punt return touchdowns, season

Special teams touchdowns, season, rookie

Combined KR/PR touchdowns, season, rookie

#3 — 2006 Week 10, 108-yard missed field goal return at Giants

Return count: 3rd overall, 3rd of the season

New Bears record:

Special teams touchdowns, season, rookie

NFL record tied:

Longest play in NFL history: 108 yards (tied with Nathan Vasher, 2005)

Bears record tied:

Longest play in Bears history: 108 yards (tied with Nathan Vasher, 2005)

Here is the return that made the Hester record tracker so tricky. Hester is one of 18 players in NFL history to return a missed FG for a touchdown, with two doing it twice. (More on that here.) But none of the other players who Hester ended up chasing and passing on the career kickoff-punt touchdown list had a missed field goal return. Nor did they have any other special teams touchdowns: a blocked punt return or a blocked field goal return.

That meant that from this point on in his career, whatever career number announcers said Hester was on, in a way, he was on one more. So when he tied Brian Mitchell for most career kickoff-punt touchdowns (which is what the broadcasts always noted), he had actually passed Brian Mitchell for career special teams touchdowns.

That ended up mattering twice: once as a rookie, when he passed and then tied Ken Houston for “return touchdowns in a season,” which in real time I figured was kick-punt return but turned out to just be any return, since Houston set the record in 1971 on four interceptions and a fumble recovery, and much later in the “non-offensive touchdowns” record for which he tied and then passed Deion.

This is also the touchdown that helped make more records for Hester, as you’ll see.

#4 — 2006 Week 13, 45-yard punt return vs. Vikings

Return count: 4th overall, 4th of the season, 3rd PR of career/season

New Bears record:

Combined KR/PR touchdowns, season, rookie

Punt return touchdowns, season

NFL/Bears record tied:

Most special teams touchdowns, season

Bears record tied:

Most career PR touchdowns

Chicago Tribune, next day: “Hester is the 10th player in NFL history to return four kicks for touchdowns in a season (and) the fourth Bear to have three punt return touchdowns in his career, joining Dennis McKinnon, Steve Schubert and Ray ‘Scooter’ McLean.”

Take a look at the above screenshot of Hester vs. the Jets. That’s Week 11, 2006. The screen graphic notes that with three “kicks” returned for a TD (two punts and the missed field goal), Hester was now “1 shy of NFL record.” The broadcast itself didn’t elaborate. The record in this case was not combined kickoff-punt return touchdowns, because that was four and Hester was still only at two.

And the record wasn’t return touchdowns, because that was Ken Houston with five and Hester was only at three.

So the record here, I suppose, is special teams touchdowns, which was four, though it might have also been special teams touchdowns for a rookie. Same record! Jack Christiansen returned four punts for touchdowns in 1951 and Travis Williams returned four kickoffs for touchdowns in 1967. They both did it as rookies, meaning even today, the NFL season records for punt return TDs and kickoff return TDs are co-held by rookies.

Okay, now take a look at the above screenshot of Hester vs. the Vikings in Week 13. His 45-yard punt return touchdown was his fourth TD return overall. The graphic noted that he tied the “NFL rookie record.” But this would be for special teams returns, since Hester didn’t have four PR TDs, meaning it wasn’t just the rookie record, it was the overall NFL record. Indeed, two Bears were co-holders of this record: Gale Sayers scored on three kickoffs and one punt in 1967, his third season, and Cecil Turner scored on four kickoffs in 1970, his third season too.

So yes, this was all quite confusing and I understand why just like special teams coverage units, NFL broadcasts throughout 2006 and 2007 had trouble keeping up with Devin Hester.

Last note: to again contextualize just how insane Hester’s 2006 and 2007 were, here is the coverage in 2003 of Dante Hall’s fourth return touchdown of the season, which tied the NFL season record. Hall was on an absolutely bonkers tear, with seven return touchdowns over 10 games from 2002 to 2003. His return numbers in those 10 games:

24 PR, 532 yards, 22.2 yards per punt return, 4 TD

30 KR, 858 yards, 28.6 yards per kickoff return, 3 TD

Here is what the NFL season record book looked like then:

#5 — 2006 Week 14, 94-yard kickoff return at Rams

Return count: 5th overall, 5th of the season, 1st KR of career/season

New NFL/Bears record:

Most special teams touchdowns, season

New Bears record:

Most special teams touchdowns, season

Kickoff return touchdowns, season, rookie

NFL record tied:

Most non-offensive touchdowns, season

Most combined KR/PR touchdowns, season

#6 — 2006 Week 14, 96-yard kickoff return at Rams

Return count: 6th overall, 6th of the season, 2nd KR of career/season

New NFL record:

Most non-offensive touchdowns, season

Most combined KR/PR touchdowns, season

NFL record tied:

Kickoff return touchdowns in a game

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns in a game

These two return touchdowns against the Rams made Hester a legend. Because the game was on Monday Night Football, the act of setting the new “return record” entered the collective football consciousness. This would also serve as a prelude for Hester’s late-career chase of Deion, the idea that Devin could run back so many kickoffs and punts that he would score more than defensive players who were on the field maybe five times more snaps per game.

Away from the broadcast, other media members didn’t talk about the returns record (passing Ken Houston) and focused instead on the kickoff/punt return season record. The Tribune’s coverage was entirely on Hester breaking the 10-way tie of four special teams return touchdowns in a season:

Super Bowl XLI: 92-yard kickoff return

New Super Bowl record:

Fastest touchdown, time: 14 seconds

Fastest score, time: 14 seconds (since passed)

Fastest touchdown, plays: 1st play

Unofficial season record

Most return touchdowns or special teams touchdowns including playoffs: 7

Most combined kick/punt return touchdowns: 6 (Tied by Hester in 2007)

Looking back at the broadcast of Hester’s return in Super Bowl XLI, what stands out is that the announcers did not point out that Hester’s return touchdown was the fastest score in Super Bowl history. Maybe they thought it was too obvious: of course it was! No one had ever returned the opening kickoff of a Super Bowl for a touchdown. And maybe they mentioned it later in the broadcast and I’ve just forgotten. I’ve watched Super Bowl XLI more than anyone should and I just don’t remember.

But the previous record was Jerry Rice’s 44-yard touchdown catch from Steve Young to open Super Bowl XXIX. That was the fourth play of the game and a score in just one minute and 24 seconds. That was insanely fast — and the Niners then set an even tougher record of speed for their second touchdown at under five minutes and on just seven offensive plays.

From the Buffalo News, the day before Super Bowl XLI: “Hester is already being compared to all-time great return men like Gale Sayers, Mel Gray, Billy ‘White Shoes’ Johnson, Eric Metcalf, Brian Mitchell and Hester’s boyhood idol, Deion Sanders. Mitchell holds the NFL career record with 13 return touchdowns. Metcalf has a league-best 10 punt return TDs. Sanders’ 19 defensive and return TDs are an NFL record.”

#7 — 2007 Week 2, 73-yard punt return vs. Kansas City

Return count: 7th overall, 1st of the season, 4th PR of career, 1st PR of season

New Bears record:

Most career PR touchdowns

Fun fact: In this game, Hester had a 95-yard kickoff return called back on a Bears holding penalty. If that touchdown had counted, Hester would have had over 100 return yards on both kickoffs and punts with a touchdown on both.

Only one player in NFL history pulled off that quartet of 100+ yards on kickoff returns, 100+ yards on punt returns, one kickoff return touchdown and one punt return touchdown: Eddie Payton (Walter’s brother) in 1977.

#8 — 2007 Week 4, 97-yard kickoff return at Lions

Return count: 8th overall, 2nd of the season, 3rd KR of career

Bears record tied:

Special teams touchdowns, career

Non-offensive touchdowns, career

#9 — 2007 Week 6, 89-yard punt return vs. Vikings

Return count: 9th overall, 3rd of the season, 5th PR of career, 2nd PR of season

New Bears record:

Special teams touchdowns, career

Non-offensive touchdowns, career

Bears record tied:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

#10 — 2007 Week 12, 75-yard punt return vs. Broncos

Return count: 10th overall, 4th of the season, 6th PR of career, 3rd PR of season

New Bears record:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

#11 — 2007 Week 12, 88-yard kickoff return vs. Broncos

Return count: 11th overall, 5th of the season, 4th KR of career

NFL record tied:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, season (tied with himself from 2006)

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns in a game (including his mark from 2006)

Hester had a series of games in his first two seasons that elevated his status, and the Broncos game in 2007 was where the final holdouts had to start talking about him in “all-time” terms. Hester’s two return touchdowns were #10 and #11 of his career, or #9 and #10 on combined kickoffs/punts.

Notice the first two screenshots above, one when the score was 0-0, one when it was 13-12 Denver, just before the PAT after Hester’s first touchdown. In the first shot, toward the start of the game, the broadcast noted that Hester had “9 CAREER TOTAL RETURN TD” which they called a Bears record. Here they included the missed field goal return.

The next screenshot is after Hester’s first touchdown of the game, which the broadcast referred to as his “9th CAREER KICK RETURN TD (6 PR, 3 KR)” and noting that touchdown set a new team record, passing Gale Sayers.

Thus we have both records noted in the same game: the special teams return record and the “kick return” record.

So yes, his first return touchdown gave him the new Bears career kickoffs/punts touchdown record, passing Gale Sayers, while his second score brought him in rarefied NFL air: double-digit kickoff/punt return touchdowns, joining just Brian Mitchell, Dante Hall and Eric Metcalf.

The NFL and Bears list after the Broncos game:

From this point on, broadcasts started talking about Hester’s place on the all-time return touchdown list, often pointing out the disparity in games played and/or total returns. From the Bears-Giants game the week after the Broncos game:

#12 — 2007 Week 17, 64-yard punt return vs. Saints

Return count: 12th overall, 6th of the season, 7th PR of career

New NFL record:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, season

NFL record tied:

Punt return touchdowns, season

Special teams touchdowns, season (tied with himself from 2006)

Hester’s final return touchdown of 2007 gave him six for the season, four punt returns for the season and 12 (or 11 without the missed field goal) return touchdowns for his career. The six combined kickoff-punt return touchdowns meant Hester broke his own NFL record from the year before, while the six special teams touchdowns meant Hester tied his own record:

Devin Hester records after two seasons

NFL:

Most special teams and overall return TDs in a season: 6, twice

Most kickoff/punt TDs in a season: 6, 2007

Most special teams TDs in a season including playoffs: 7, 2006

Bears:

Above NFL records are also Bears records

Most special teams, kickoff/punt and overall return TDs, career: 12

Most punt return touchdowns, career: 7

#13 — 2010 Week 3, 62-yard punt return vs. Packers

Return count: 13th overall, 1st of the season, 8th PR of career

NFL record tied:

Special teams return touchdowns, career

#14 — 2010 Week 6, 89-yard punt return vs. Seahawks

Return count: 14th overall, 2nd of the season, 9th PR of career

New NFL record:

Special teams return touchdowns, career

NFL record tied:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

Note: This is the football that Devin Hester gave Hunter Hillenmeyer. While it was announced as “the record-tying return,” when you go by “special teams” rather than “kickoff-punt,” this becomes the record-setting special teams football.

#15 — 2010 Week 15, 64-yard punt return at Vikings

Return count: 15th overall, 3rd of the season, 10th PR of career

Extended NFL record:

Special teams return touchdowns, career

New NFL record:

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

Most seasons with three or more special teams touchdowns: 3

NFL record tied:

Punt return touchdowns, career

Most games with a PR TD and receiving TD, career: 3 (tied with Bullet Bob Hayes)

This touchdown return against the Vikings is one of the most famous of Hester’s career. The visuals were unique: the snow in Minnesota, with the teams playing outdoors at the University of Minnesota due to the collapse earlier that week of the Metronome roof due to snowfall. The dominant 40-14 Bears win gave the Bears the NFC North crown for the first time since the Super Bowl season.

The return was announced as breaking Brian Mitchell’s all-time combined kick return (i.e. kickoff + punt) record. Flying under the radar was that Hester tied Eric Metcalf for the most career punt return touchdowns at 10.

One other note is significant for our purposes: from this point on, every Hester return extended his NFL record for special teams touchdowns, with kick-punt and punt soon joining. He had been extending his Bears records for a while, but since his career ultimately started driving toward Deion Sanders, I’m going to mark the extended records too.

NFL unofficial record tied:

Most games with a punt or kickoff TD and receiving TD, career: 4 (tied with Bobby Mitchell)

This is the first return touchdown of Devin Hester’s career that did not tie or break a new major Bears or NFL record. I say “new” because of course, as I noted, Hester was now always extending his special teams touchdown record and his kickoff-punt return record.

But there is a new minor record here — one of those Elias/Stathead ones that no broadcast was likely to note.

Because Hester opened this game with a 48-yard receiving touchdown from Jay Cutler and later returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown, the kickoff touchdown gave him a fourth career game in which he had both a punt or kickoff return touchdown and a receiving touchdown.

That seems to tie Bobby Mitchell’s NFL record for most such games. That’s not a record I’ve seen tracked anywhere, and it’s not one you can do with Stathead — you have to check receiving/punt + receiving/kickoff individually. So I’m calling that an unofficial record to go along with the official extension of his own career records.

#18 — 2011 Week 10, 82-yard punt return vs. Lions

Return count: 18th overall, 3rd of the season, 12th PR of career

Extended NFL record:

Special teams return touchdowns, career

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

Punt return touchdowns, career

New NFL record:

Most seasons with 2+ punt return touchdowns

Tied NFL record:

Most seasons with 2+ combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns

Here we have another lesser-known record: most seasons with 2+ punt return touchdowns. Hester did this in 2006, 2007 and 2010, which tied him with Eric Metcalf (1993, 1994, 1997). This return touchdown gave him the new NFL record of four such seasons.

The touchdown also tied an NFL record: most seasons with 2+ kickoff or punt return touchdowns. Again, Hester had four, tying him with Metcalf, who also returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in 1990, and Brian Mitchell: 2 PR 1991, 2 PR 1994, 1 of each in 1997, 1 of each in 2000.

These records are important because they show Hester’s longevity and consistency. Two combined kickoff-punt return touchdowns is a great season. As I wrote last month, Hester sometimes gets reduced to his biggest numbers without as much acknowledgement for his consistent numbers.

Having the most seasons with 2+ punt return touchdowns and sharing the most seasons with 2+ combined kick-punt return touchdowns shows that consistency.

#19 — 2013 Week 7, 81-yard punt return at Washington

Return count: 19th overall, 13th PR of career

Extended NFL record:

Special teams return touchdowns, career

Combined kickoff/punt return touchdowns, career

Punt return touchdowns, career

Tied NFL record:

All returns AKA non-offensive touchdowns, career

After getting blanked on return touchdowns in 2012 (though still helping the Bears finish 5th in the NFL in starting field position), Hester got back on the scoreboard in 2013. His 19th career return touchdown tied Deion Sanders for the most return touchdowns in NFL history. Deion had set the record in 1997 when his 50-yard pick-six on Brett Favre gave him 14 career return touchdowns, a chart that looked like this:

Announcing the game, Pat Summerall described Deion’s 14th return touchdown like this: “That is his 14th touchdown by return, a new NFL record.” The touchdown broke Deion’s tie with Lamar Parrish, whose 13 return touchdowns were even more eclectic than Deion’s:

Interception: 4

Punt: 4

Fumble recovery: 3

Kickoff: 1

Blocked field goal: 1

Deion’s final return touchdown tally looked like this:

Interception: 9

Punt: 6

Kickoff: 3

Fumble recovery: 1

Devin tied his idol Deion in Week 7 of 2013, and we were all hoping he would break the record as a Bear. The Bears let Hester become a free agent in March of 2014, and he signed a three-year deal with the Falcons later that month, joining the franchise where Deion Sanders first became an NFL icon.

#20 — 2014 Week 3, 62-yard punt return vs. Buccaneers (with Falcons)

Return count: 20th overall, 14th PR of career

...so it was fitting that if Devin had to break Deion’s record with any team other than the Bears, he did it with Atlanta. Not only that, but he did it in Atlanta against Lovie Smith and with Deion in the house as a broadcaster. When Hester fielded the punt in space, gave his trademark pause and then exploded forward, I knew this was the one.

Quickly he was ahead of half of Tampa’s coverage unit, and when he easily evaded Bucs punter Michael Koenen, all that was left was the high-stepping.

All that’s left now is his suit coat measurements.
