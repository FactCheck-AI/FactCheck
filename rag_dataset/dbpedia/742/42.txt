The recent Palaszczuk Cabinet reshuffle has led to accusations of a revolving door in some portfolios, but how true is that? Queensland political reporter Chris O'Brien looks at which ministries have experienced most change under Labor and the Liberal National Party in the past three terms.

Police and public works have been the most tumultuous ministries in the past eight years in Queensland, with six different ministers responsible for both over the past three terms of government.

The recent reshuffle of the Palaszczuk Labor Cabinet resulted in the third minister for Police, Emergency and Corrective Services in two years, and Bill Byrne became the third minister for Agriculture — although he has been in the role twice this term.

There were two police ministers in the previous term under LNP premier Campbell Newman, and one in the term before that under Labor's Anna Bligh.

In the same period, there have also been six ministers for public works — two in each term.

The ABC analysed the number of times a minister was appointed to a particular portfolio title in each of the three terms.

The Newman ministry was the most stable, with a total of 39 ministry or portfolio appointments in three years.

Fifty portfolios were filled by 22 ministers in the last three years of the Bligh government.

The first two years of the Palaszczuk Labor government has had 48 ministerial or portfolio spots.

After police and public works, the biggest turnover has been in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy, agriculture, arts, employment, housing, multicultural affairs, science and transport, with five names on each office door in eight years.
