Hayman et al. (1966: 66, map 106) mentioned this species from five localities: two in the northeast of the DRC (Avakubi, Tshopo Province and Medje, Haut-Uélé Province) and three in the southwestern part of the country (Luluabourg [= Kananga], Kasaï Central Province, Luebo, Kasaï Province and Ndwa, Mai- Ndombe Province). Additional specimens have been collected at a number of localities in Rwanda, in Kwilu Province (Mosenge and Kikwit), in Kongo Central Province (Banana), but also in Yalosemba and on the road between Bombanga and Bumba (Mongala Province) and Tandala (Sud-Ubangi Province), in the northwest of the DRC. Although the SDM map shows more red than the one presented by Happold (2013y: 536), it looks very similar, with a northern and southern-central branch in the DRC, passing around the Congolian rainforest. We, however, suspect that the two branches might reunite in the eastern part of the DRC.
