COPASI (Complex Pathway Simulator) is the main topic of the BioModelling Spring Riga in 2018. The first COPASI version is published in 2006. The peculiarity of COPASI is the graphical user interface that enables modelling without programming skills. That is important while building interaction between biologists and mathematicians. Another important aspect is that COPASI is free of charge for academic use and needs no other software product to be run. The named aspects and some more ones have helped COPASI to become a popular tool for modelling as well as education. COPASI has also developed community and support. COPASI has been also the first software used by Computational Systems Biology Group, the organiser of BioModeling Spring Riga. This modelling course is dedicated to the introduction in COPASI as well as showing a number of advanced options that can be demonstrated by interesting use cases. Course topics include: - basic introduction in kinetic modeling - global stochastic optimization methods in parameter estimation and optimisation - total optimization potential (TOP) approach - introduction of constraints in parameter estimation and optimization tasks - sample COPASI models of metabolism, signaling, pharmacokinetics LECTURERS
