The lands of Montrave (originally Monthrivie), Aithernie and others are reputed to have been granted to the nuns of North Berwick by Duncan, Earl of Fife about 1160. The old Montrave house was built by Major Alexander Anderson who served with distinction in the Madras Engineers during the mahratta War. His son Captain John Anderson of Montrave was an officer with the East India Company and fell at the siege of Lucknow in 1858 whereafter the estate was acquired by Mr Allan Gilmour. The house was rebuilt by John Gilmour esq. of Lundin and Montrave, who, at Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897, was created a baronet. The Gilmours were a Renfrewshire family who had extensive interests in Canadian timber and shipping. One branch of the family settled in Fife, acquiring the estates of Lundin in 1872 and Montrave in 1873, adding Greenside, Pratis and part of Kilmux later.
