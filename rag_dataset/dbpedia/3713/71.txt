Celebrate the holiday season by getting to know one of the world’s great spiritual leaders at the Movies That Matter screening of 10 Questions for the Dalai Lama on Dec. 17 at 4:30 pm.

This 2006 film documents filmmaker and explorer Rick Ray’s meetings over the course of several months with Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama at his monastery in Dharamsala, India. In the documentary the question and answer interviews are inter-cut with a biography of Tenzin Gyatso, a history of modern Tibet, and a chronicle of Ray’s journey securing the interview. Included is rare historical footage as well as footage filmed with hidden cameras within Tibet.

Ray asks a range of questions, touching on philosophical, social and political issues including: “Why do the poor seem happier than the rich?” and “Will there be another Dalai Lama?”

The film is part of the monthly Movies That Matter series examining a wide range of issues. Donations to cover public performance license fees are appreciated. The UU Fellowship is located at 10341 Highway 42 in Ephraim. For more information call 920.854.7559.
