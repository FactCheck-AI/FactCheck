Career

Within Mudvayne, McDonough is the person who was probably the most influential in setting the direction for the concept themes on the band's first two albums. He is also known for composing, recording, mixing, and mastering the electronic interludes on both L.D. 50 and The End of All Things to Come.

For his solo work, in 2008 McDonough released his first album under the alias "MjDawn" with his cousin David W. McDonough, called Frequency Response. On the album, he experiments with acoustic drumming and electronica. McDonough, as MjDawn, also has several side projects both with ambient/electronica artist Vir Unis under the band name MiKroNaught and with guitarist RFSans under the band name ultrAtheist.

On the production side of the music industry, he is co-owner of the label AtmoWorks together with Vir Unis.

McDonough spent his formative years in Rockford, Illinois, while attending Rockford East High School and as a member of the Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps. He was previously in a band called On the Shoulders of Giants, and is currently in the band Audiotopsy with former Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett.
