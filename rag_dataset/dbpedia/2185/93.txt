Here is an ebullient Ella Fitzgerald, exuding the warmth and spirit and good cheer with which the Yuletide is usually equated.

Mindful that Christmas albums normally emphasize the religious and the solemn, Ella chose in this to stress the festive aspect of the season; hence the latitude employed in the selection of material. As if to ask: Why not the peace and good will of Christmas the year 'round?

So here is Ella for Christmas - twelve happy, winter songs, happily sung to happily suggest that yours be a Swinging Christmas - anytime - all the time!

Selections:

1. Jingle Bells

2. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town

3. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas

4. What Are You Doing This New Year's Eve?

5. Sleigh Ride

6. The Christmas Song

7. Good Morning Blues

8. Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

9. Winter Wonderland

10. Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer

11. Frosty The Snow Man

12. White Christmas

All selections recorded July 15 & 16, 1960 at Columbia Recording Studios, New York City, except "Good Morning Blues", "Sleigh Ride", "The Christmas Song" and "White Christmas" which were recorded August 5, 1960 at Radio Recorders, Hollywood, California.
