General paralysis of the insane is a syndrome of madness and weakness occurring in tertiary syphilis, which is now very rare because of treatment with penicillin.

The signs of this condition are usually those of:

sudden personality change

radical alteration of the patient's previous ethical and moral standards

development of extravagant and grandiose behaviour

the clinical picture then seems to level out and then is followed by a progressive dementing illness

there may be an accompanying affective state of flat euphoria

the patient may have Argyll-Robertson pupils

CSF:

CSF pressure is often slightly raised

microscopy shows an excess of mononuclear cells and protein with a marked increase in globulin fraction

serology is always positive

Death usually occurs within three years.
