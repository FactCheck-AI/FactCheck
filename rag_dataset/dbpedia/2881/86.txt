It seems as though the ESRB listing was correct and that the beloved GameCube game Beyond Good & Evil is receiving a special 20th-anniversary edition. A listing for the game, which includes updated textures, lighting, an additional treasure hunt story, and a making-of feature, appeared temporarily on the Xbox Store before being taken down. Beyond Good & Evil 20th Anniversary Edition will hopefully find its way onto the Nintendo Switch, although that has yet to be confirmed by Ubisoft. It sounds like an announcement is imminent.
