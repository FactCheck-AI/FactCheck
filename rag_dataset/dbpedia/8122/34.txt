How did Pythagoreanism end?

Pythagoras and the Pythagorean Philosophy

Pythagoras, a seminal figure in ancient Greek philosophy, founded a movement that was part philosophical school and part religious brotherhood. Born around 570 BCE, Pythagoras traveled widely before settling in Croton, a Greek colony in southern Italy, where he established his community. His teachings combined mystical religious beliefs with philosophical inquiry, which was a novel approach at the time.

The Pythagorean philosophy was notably distinct from other contemporary Greek thoughts due to its emphasis on mathematics as a universal language and a means to understand the cosmos. Pythagoras is famously credited with the formulation of the Pythagorean theorem, a fundamental principle in geometry that states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. However, his influence extended beyond mathematics into the realms of music, astronomy, and ethics, illustrating the interconnectedness of all things through numbers.

Pythagorean way of Life

The Pythagoreans adopted a strict, ascetic, and communal lifestyle. Followers were expected to live an anti-hedonistic life, eschewing personal luxuries and living communally as a demonstration of their detachment from the materialistic desires of earthly existence. This communal living helped foster a strong sense of brotherhood and shared purpose among the members, which was central to their identity.

Moreover, Pythagoras and his followers practiced various forms of fasting and engaged in prophecies, reflecting their belief in the possibility of accessing higher spiritual truths. Pythagoras himself was credited with unusual psychic powers, which added to his mystique and the aura of divine wisdom that surrounded him. These practices not only bonded the group but also set them apart from the mainstream of Greek social life, contributing to their distinct communal identity.

Crisis of Earthly Life and Final Confessional Attitude

The Pythagoreans viewed earthly life as a temporary phase in the soulâ€™s journey, emphasizing the need for spiritual purification and preparation for the afterlife. This worldview was deeply influenced by the notion of the transmigration of souls, a belief that the soul moves from one body to another across different lifetimes, which Pythagoras is said to have introduced to Greek thought.

This perspective fostered a confessional attitude among his followers, where moral and spiritual integrity were paramount. The final confession, a practice where members would confess their sins or wrongdoings to the group, was a method of maintaining moral accountability and cleansing the soul, which was critical for their spiritual evolution and preparation for the next life.

Extermination and Absorption into Broader Philosophical Trends

A combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures contributed to the decline of Pythagoreanism, which ultimately resulted in its dissolution by the third century BC. Initially, the Pythagoreans faced direct persecution and violence, most notably during the 5th century BC, when the community in Croton was attacked and dispersed following political conflicts. This pattern of persecution continued across different regions, reflecting the political and social resistance against their esoteric and influential practices. Additionally, the inherently secretive nature of the Pythagorean community, which relied heavily on oral transmission of its doctrines, made the continuity of their teachings challenging once the communities were disbanded and their members scattered. The combination of these factors led to the gradual disappearance of Pythagoreanism as a distinct entity by the end of the 3rd century. However, the legacy of Pythagorean ideas continued to influence Western thought through the frameworks of later philosophical schools, ensuring that the essence of Pythagorean thought survived even as the movement itself faded.

Over time, as Greek philosophy evolved, many central ideas of Pythagoreanism were assimilated into emerging philosophical currents, particularly into Platonism and Neoplatonism. Concepts such as the transmigration of souls and the significance of numerical patterns in understanding the universe were integrated into these broader philosophical frameworks. This integration, while ensuring the survival of Pythagorean ideas, diluted the distinct identity of Pythagoreanism as these concepts became part of a larger philosophical dialogue. Additionally, the incorrect assignment and interpretation of Pythagorean teachings led to the loss of their unique philosophical identity. This was because the original ideas were absorbed and reinterpreted within the broad development of Greek thought.

The final phase of the decline coincided with significant shifts in the philosophical and religious landscape of the ancient world. By the 3rd century AD, the philosophical focus had shifted towards more practical concerns like ethics and personal conduct under the influence of Stoicism and, subsequently, the rise of Christianity. The Christian doctrine, while incorporating some elements of Hellenistic philosophies, opposed and replaced many of the pagan philosophies, including Pythagoreanism. The rise of Christianity, combined with the earlier integration of Pythagorean concepts into dominant philosophical schools, marked the end of Pythagoreanism as a distinct and influential force in the ancient world, transitioning its legacy into the foundations of Western thought.
