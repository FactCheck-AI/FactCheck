In the /e/ documentation Samsung Galaxy S6 the model SM-G925F is identified by the codename “zerofltexx”.

In the /e/ documentation Samsung Galaxy S6 edge the model SM-G920F is identified by the codename “zeroltexx”.

Samsung’s website displays the Galaxy S6 edge as model SM-G925F and the Galaxy S6 as SM-G920F.

The curved Super Amoled display on both sides is the significant design difference.

Can you please check the /e/ description and replace the model designations?

In the /e/ documentation of the two Samsung models Galaxy S6 + S6 edge is referred to “Download a custom recovery - you can download TWRP.”

The call of this website shows an error:

.

If the user searches for the appropriate TWRP version for the SM-G925F and SM-G920F model via the website https://twrp.me/Devices/Samsung/ the user ends up with the data:

twrp-3.3.1-0-zeroflte.img.tar

twrp-3.3.1-0-zeroflte.img

respektiv

twrp-3.3.1-0-zerolte.img.tar

twrp-3.3.1-0-zerolte.img

Can you please check this and correct it?!

Obviously! The development for TWRP zerofltexx & zeroltexx seems to have stopped at version 3.0.2-1 and TeamWin TWRP removed the files without comment.

Everything points to the use of twrp-3.3.1-0-zeroflte & -zerolte to add TWRP recovery to the Galaxy S6 / S6 edge.

The misleading model numbers of the Samsung Galaxy S6 & S6 edge as well as the empty links for the TWRP versions ("404 Page not found.) is an accidental action in the /e/ documentation and should be corrected immediately.
