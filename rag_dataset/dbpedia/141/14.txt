Animal Crossing Plaza has launched as a free download on Wii U.

The free app, which will be supported until the end of 2014, enables Animal Crossing fans to discuss the game and share information with the Miiverse community.

Fans will be able to share images taken from the recently released 3DS game, and can also import and organise custom QR code patterns from SD cards.

Other players will be able to scan the custom QR code patterns for use in Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

The Animal Crossing Plaza app was announced during today's (August 7) Nintendo Direct conference, alongside the Sonic: Lost World release date and confirmation of a European launch for Professor Layton vs Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney.

Animal Crossing: New Leaf sees players become the mayor of their own town, giving them options to change the town's layout or set shop prices and closing times.

Expanded customisation features let players create their own patterns for clothing and for the first time also use those patterns for furniture, such as the quilt on a bed.
