The European Championship is over, but the football summer remains exciting: it is now high season on the transfer market.

With Nedilijko Labrovic, a Reusch keeper is transferring to the German Bundesliga!

From the new season onwards, the 24-year-old will be in goal for FC Augsburg, having previously played for Croatian first division club HNK Rijeka. At the European Championships, Labrovic was part of the Croatian national team as backup goalkeeper, together with 1st goalkeeper Dominik Livakovic, also a Reusch keeper.

"It's a dream come true," says Labrovic about his transfer to Augsburg.

FC Augsburg signed a strong netminder: Nedilijko didn't concede a single goal in 18 games in Croatia's first division last season.

We wish you all the best at your new club, Nedo!
