Information about Berlin

The capital and also the largest city of Germany is located in the east of the country, only 70 km from Poland. Berlin stands on the Spree River, which is why in guidebooks you can often find the second name of the German capital - "Athens on the Spree." The historical center of the city lies in a lowland, the modern city is located on the hills (Teltow and Barnim).

The 20th century was particularly dramatic for Berlin, with the setbacks of World War I, the rise of National Socialism, and the catastrophic impact of World War II, which brought the country to the brink of ruin. After the war, Berlin was divided between the victorious powers, with East Berlin falling under the influence of the Soviet Union and the West Berlin coming under the control of the Allies.

For many years, Berlin existed as a city divided between two states until the reunification of Germany in 1989. It was at that moment when the Berlin we know today emerged, opening its doors to millions of tourists. The reunification marked a significant turning point in the city's history and set the stage for its transformation into a vibrant and dynamic metropolis.
