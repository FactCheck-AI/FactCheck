Septembers of Shiraz premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2015. Adrien Brody and Salma Hayek star in this adaptation of the critically acclaimed debut novel by Iranian American author Dalia Sofer. Based on a true story, the film is about a secular Jewish family caught up in the maelstrom of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
