At once a moving human drama and a timely suspense thriller, Septembers of Shiraz is the story of a family thrust into an unimaginably surreal experience in post-Revolutionary Iran. Their unexpected journey to a new life begins with the arrest of Isaac Amin, a successful jewel dealer and law-abiding citizen accused out of the blue, inexplicably, of being a spy. Taken to a secret prison, Isaac’s life unravels overnight but the effects resonate equally through his stunned family, left behind to figure out what has happened to them in an atmosphere of sweeping change and fear. As Isaac’s wife defiantly searches for a way out -- and as Isaac searches to understand his sudden reversal of fate – they each must confront who they are, where they come from and what the future olds…even as events build to an incalculably dangerous attempt to escape tyranny.
