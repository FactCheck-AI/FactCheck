The Forex Club analytical department presented the results of quarter research, declaring the Moldovan leu as the most stable currency in the CIS space.

CIS currencies demonstrated mixed dynamics against the US dollar. The Moldovan leu, the Russian ruble and the Kyrgyzstani som have strengthened. At the same time, the Uzbekistan sum, the Kazakhstani tenge and the Georgian lari have depreciated most actively.

“The Moldovan leu keeps rehabilitating after the 2016 presidential elections. The Moldovan goods’ access to the Russian market gave the opportunity to raise exports by more than 13.9% over 7 months of 2017. Also, tourism is actively developing in Moldova, which raises the inflow of foreign currency”, the research says.

Its authors say that the Moldovan leu strengthened 3% in July-September, while the Russian ruble – only 1.8%.

The Forex Club research proved that the Moldovan leu is one of the world’s most stable currencies year to date. It strengthened 11.9% against the US dollar. In Europe, only the Czech crone, Polish zloty and Serbian dinar strengthened more – 15.3%, 13.6% and 13.5%, respectively.

According to analysts, the index of the US dollar against the world currency basket fell 10.1% since the beginning of 2017. The weakness of the US dollar was supported by investors’ uncertainty that the US Federal Reserve System will change the monetary policy.
