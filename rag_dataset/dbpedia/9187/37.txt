The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) puts into circulation today commemorative coins and banknotes on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Moldovan currency [leu] marked on November 29.

According to the National Bank of Moldova, the coin ‘20 years since the introduction of national currency in Moldova’ has been released in the series ‘Historical Events’, in two versions: golden and silver.

The coin is of rectangular shape and carries the image of Medieval ruler Stefan cel Mare. The golden coins are released in only 100 copies, whereas the silver ones – in 2,000 copies.

The commemorative 200-lei banknote is similar to the currently used cash notes. The single difference is the additional inscription ’20 years’ and the signature of the incumbent President of the National Bank of Moldova Dorin Dragutanu. Moreover, the newly-released banknotes (issued in 200 thousand copies) have several improvements and better protective elements.

Among the new coins there is also one dedicated to the 1900th anniversary since the construction of the Traian Column. The nominal value of this coin is 100 lei. It has been released in 2,000 copies.

The series ‘Holidays. Culture. Traditions in Moldova’ has been replenished by the silver coin ‘Plugusor’ with a nominal value of 50 lei, which has been issued in 2,000 copies. At the same time, the NBM released a new coin in the series ‘Moldovan Monasteries’ and two coins in the series ‘Moldova’s Red Book’.

Infotag’s dossier: In 2013, the National Bank of Moldova released 12 commemorative coins. The first commemorative coin was issued by the National Bank of Moldova in 1996 and was dedicated to the 5th anniversary of Moldova’s independence. Given the fact that the Republic of Moldova does not have its own banknote printing and minting works, the coins are produced abroad. Since 1996, over 100 anniversary and commemorative coins, which market prices are much higher than their nominal values, have been released by the NBM.
