Product Details

The '' Bonnet Skog'' takes its name from the Norwegian word ''skog'', meaning ''forest''. This design evokes the robustness and serenity of the vast forests of Northern Quebec. With its wide band of looped sheepskin around the ears, it offers enveloping warmth and welcome comfort, reminiscent of traditional lumberjack hats.
