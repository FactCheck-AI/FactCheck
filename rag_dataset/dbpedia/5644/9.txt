Helle Skog is a modern take on a classic carving knife and a step-in knife to start enjoy the relaxation when creating something from a piece of wood.

Wood carving has become more and more popular in an increasingly frantic lifestyle. The Helle Skog (Norwegian for 'forest') is a perfect knife to get started with crafting in wood. A place of calm and a place where time slows down. As the name suggests, it is also a knife designed to be used in the forest as a companion for many tasks.

The Skog is slightly more robust than a specialized carving knife, offering a wider range of uses. Its hand sanded and contour shaped handle offers a comfortable grip for long sessions without giving hotspots. Smooth contours offer a nice grip and guides your hand to a safe position, even when holding close to the blade.

The knife has a popping sharp triple laminated stainless steel blade and comes with a leather sheath.
