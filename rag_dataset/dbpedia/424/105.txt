The Cadiz town of Espera, which forms part of the Route of the Pueblos Blancos, is located in the vicinity of the Sierra of Cadiz, with its urban center on the slopes of the Fatetar Hill. Located 82 kilometers from the capital, the municipality is bordered to the north by Utrera, to the east by Villamart√≠n and Bornos, to the south by Arcos de la Frontera and Jerez and to the west by Lebrija.

The first traces of civilization date back to the Palaeolithic period, thanks to the sites of carved stone tools found in the municipality. Various archaeological finds also confirm the presence of civilizations such as Iberian, Carthaginian and Turdetan. However, it was not until the Roman invasion that the villas of Carissa Aurelia and Esperilla, in the vicinity of present-day Espera, appeared.

The arrival of the Visigoths led to the building of a fort where the Fatetar Castle now stands. Subsequently, the Nasrid invasion led to the disappearance of Carissa and the foundation of a village surrounded by a new wall.

The Christian reconquest took the alcazaba as a fortress until the end of the conquest of the kingdom of Granada. With the fall of the Muslim territory, the castle ceased to serve as a defense and a process of repopulation of the area began, with the construction of houses in the lower areas. Thus, two urban centers were formed: Old Villa, inside the castle walls, and New Villa, where Espera is currently located.
