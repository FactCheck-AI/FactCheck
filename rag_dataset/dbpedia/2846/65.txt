February: A pandemic love story from 1892

In February, former morning host Chuck Hinman talked with local restaurant owner and history buff Bob Burke about the love story of Italian Count Paolo Bajnotti and Carrie Brown, grand-daughter of Nicholas Brown Jr., the namesake of Brown University in Providence. In Burke’s telling, it’s a story of love and tragedy, of death in a pandemic, and the desire to triumph over death by creating a series of memorials to a timeless love.

May: Chapman Cycles

In May, we met Brian Chapman, who makes bicycles in his small workshop in Pawtuxet Village. While most bicycles you can buy these days are made in a factory in Taiwan on China, Brian makes bicycles by hand, one at a time, each one custom-designed for one cyclist.

November: The Wedding Cake House

In November, morning host Luis Hernandez and Artscape producer James Baumgartner visited the Wedding Cake House, which had been empty and abandoned on Broadway in Providence for more than 30 years. In 2017, an arts organization took control of the building. After three years of renovations, it’s a work of art on its own. Now the house hosts residencies for artists, along with a bed and breakfast business that supports the organization.
