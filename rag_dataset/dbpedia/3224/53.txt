The Beverly Hills house of the late movie producer and screenwriter Jerry Wald and his wife, Connie, has sold for $6,337,500.

The Pennsylvania Dutch Colonial Revival-style house was a gathering spot for the Hollywood elite for decades after the couple bought the place in 1943. Such screen stars as Audrey Hepburn, Jimmy Stewart, Marilyn Monroe, Cary Grant, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward and Harrison Ford were among the Walds’ guests.

Connie Wald often prepared and served home-style meals for the visitors and earned a reputation as an exemplary hostess. Her fried chicken was a noted favorite.

Named the Barnett House for its original owners, the 1939 home was designed by noted architect Gerard R. Colcord. A fieldstone façade, a steep roof and dormer windows retain the two-story structure’s charm. A white picket fence and lawn surround the home, which sits on nearly a half-acre.

Screening and projection rooms, a library with walls of shelves and a wood-clad living room with a fireplace are among the 5,443 square feet of living space. There are five bedrooms, five full bathrooms and a powder room.

A 725-square-foot guesthouse is near the swimming pool.

Jerry Wald, who died in 1962 at 50, produced such films as “Key Largo” (1948) and “They Drive by Night” (1940). Connie Wald died in 2012 at 96.

Bret Parsons of Coldwell Banker was the listing agent. John Gould of Rodeo Realty represented the buyer.
