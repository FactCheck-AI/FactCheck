Origins in Fort Myers

WAY Media, Inc. has been in existence since 1987. The non-profit corporation began as a single FM radio station in Fort Myers, Florida.

In the early 1980s, Bob and Felice Augsburg were residing in Fort Myers, where Bob was working as the Program Director at WSOR, a Christian Radio Station formatted for older adults. Bob and Felice have said that they "were compelled by the burden to see a younger audience reached and Bob began producing a Saturday evening broadcast geared for youth." This program, which aired on WSOR, became the springboard for Christian Rock concerts in the area and the impetus for a 24/7 station with this type of format.

Much discussion with local parents and business people led to a non-profit Florida corporation and an application filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for an unused FM frequency.

On Christmas Eve (December 24) 1986, the group received its permit for the construction of a new non-commercial FM station in Fort Myers, WAYJ. On October 9, 1987, WAYJ, broadcasting as "WAY-FM", signed on the air.

New stations and concerts

By 1992, three WAY-FM radio stations were on the air—including Fort Myers; Nashville, Tennessee (WAYM); and West Palm Beach, Florida (WAYF).

In the mid-90s, WAY-FM stations, beginning with WAYF, began to sponsor and organize large Christian music concerts and day-long music festivals. Within a few years, Nashville and Fort Myers also began to sponsor major Christian music events.

In 2002, WAYM set an all time concert attendance record of 16,000+ celebrating their 10th anniversary. Over the years, WAY-FM radio stations have been selected four times as winners of the prestigious Dove Award for excellence in the operation of Christian Radio station.

WAY Media Network Services

After several years of planning, in 1996, WAY-FM began the Christian Hit Radio Satellite Network (CHRSN). The network was designed to help other stations who desired to reach the youth and young adults of their respective communities but lacked the manpower or resources to operate a station on their own.

The Nashville WAY-FM became the flagship station of CHRSN. Most recently they changed the name of CHRSN to WAY Media Network Services. WAY-FM Nashville continues as the satellite hub.

Corporate office established

In 2001, WAY-FM Media Group established a corporate office in Colorado Springs, Colorado where Bob Augsburg, the president and founder now lives. Dusty Rhodes, former Station Manager of WAYF, joined Augsburg in Colorado as Chief Operating Officer and is now the ministry's Senior Vice President.

In 2005, Dar Ringling joined the ministry as Chief Financial Officer while Lloyd Parker, formerly General Manager of the K-LOVE & Air1 Radio Networks, became the Chief Operating Officer. They changed the station's format from Christian Rock and Rap to Christian Adult Contemporary and Worship, shifting their audience from 18- to 34-year-olds, to older adults.

Current reach

At this time, WAY-FM owns and operates 14 full power FM radio stations including, newly added stations in Denver, Colorado; Wichita, Kansas and Tallahassee, Florida. WAY-FM also owns more than 20 low-power repeater stations. The WAY Media Network Services (WMNS) serves over 25 additional radio stations nationwide with satellite programming. Today more than 70 cities are served by a WAY-FM station or repeater.

On February 3, 2009, WAY-FM joined Radiolicious and began streaming on the iPhone and iPod Touch.

In 2012, WAY-FM shifted from its long time Christian CHR format to a Christian Adult Contemporary format. Since 2013 WAY-FM via flagship station WAYM, Nashville is a Christian AC reporter to the Nielsen BDS service, and became a monitored reporter to Mediabase's Christian AC panel in April 2015.

In May 2015, Way FM announced plans to acquire KVRK, in North Texas. The Station calls letters are now KAWA and now broadcasts the national WAY-FM format. Power FM however has become an internet radio station but managed by WAY-FM Media Group.
