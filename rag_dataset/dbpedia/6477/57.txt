Saku (佐久市, Saku-shi)

- History

Saku is located in former Shinano Province, and by the Sengoku period it was home to the Ochiai clan, a samurai family that sided with Uesugi Kenshin during his conflict with Takeda Shingen in the 1550s. The Ochiai clan consequently fought for the Uesugi during the Siege of Katsurayama in March 1557; all Ochiai members who took part in the battle were killed in combat or committed suicide.

During the Edo period the area of Saku developed as the castle town of Tatsuoka Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate and as a post town.

Following the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Saku District, with the town of Asama, and the village of Higashi (from Kitasaku District) merging with the towns of Nozawa and Nakagomi (both from Minamisaku District) to create the city of Saku. On April 1, 2005 Saku absorbed the town of Usuda (from Minamisaku District), the town of Mochizuki, and the village of Asashina (both from Kitasaku District).

Nirasaki (韮崎市, Nirasaki-shi)

- History

The area around present-day Nirasaki was the ancestral homeland of the Takeda clan, which dominated Kai Province in the Sengoku period.

During the Edo period, the area was tenryō territory under the direct administration of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the village of Niirasaki was a post town on the Kōshū Kaidō highway.

During the early Meiji period, the area was organized into 14 villages under Kitakoma District, Yamanashi.

Nirasaki was elevated to town status on September 20, 1892. Modern Nirasaki City was founded by merger of Nirasaki with ten surrounding villages on October 10, 1954.

Komoro (小諸市, Komoro-shi) / Komoro Han 小諸藩 Komoro Domain

- History

The area of present-day Komoro was part of ancient Shinano Province.

The Tōsandō, one of the national routes passed Komoro, which was the location of an Umaya, or post station for government officials and army.

However, the name "Komoro" first appears in written history in the Kamakura period chronicle, Azuma Kagami. In these days, Komoro Tarō Mitsukane (小諸太郎光兼), a gokenin assigned by the shogunate to govern the area.

During the Muromachi period, the region came under the control of the Ogasawara Ōi clan. The area had a very unsettled history during the Sengoku period.

Under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate, much of the area was under the control of Komoro Domain and the town developed into a jōkamachi around Komoro Castle.

The area which later became Komoro Han 小諸藩 Komoro Domain was repeated contested between the Uesugi clan, the Takeda clan and the Later Hōjō clan during the Sengoku period, changing hands repeatedly. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi annihilated the Hōjō clan in the Siege of Odawara in 1590, he awarded Komoro as a 50,000 koku holding to 仙石秀久 Sengoku Hidehisa. The marked the start of Komoro Domain. He was confirmed in his status by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara, and his son, Sengoku Tadamasa was transferred to Ueda Domain in 1622.

Komoro was part of the holdings of Kōfu Domain from 1622-1624,

but was revived as an independent domain for Matsudaira Norinaga from 1624-1647. On his death without an heir, the domain was placed under Matsumoto Domain for a year, until the transfer of Aoyama Munetoshi, who was raised from hatamoto status. He subsequently served as Osaka jōdai from 1662, and Komoro was given to Sakai Tadayoshi, formerly of Isesaki Domain. Sakai was demoted to Tanaka Domain in Suruga Province in 1679.

The next ruler of Komoro was Nishio Tadanari, formerly of Tanaka Domain. He made great efforts to undo the damage caused by the misgovernment of Sakai Tadayoshi, but was transferred to Yokosuka Domain in 1682. Komoro was then given to a junior branch of the Matsudaira clan from 1679 to 1702.

In 1702, Makino Yasushige was transferred to Komoro from Yoita Domain in Echigo Province. This at last brought stability to the administration of the domain, as the Makino clan continued to rule until the Meiji restoration.
