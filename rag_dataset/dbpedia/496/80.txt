For over 55 years, Tower of Power has been bringing the best of funk and soul music. Since 1968, the band has been bringing their unique soul music to their fans and a souled out audience.

Their first album, 'East Bay Grease', defined their sound and landed them a contract with Warner Brothers. The 1970s were a heyday with radio classics like 'So Very Hard to Go' and 'What Is Hip?', and the band continued to tour and record throughout the years.

The band has been traveling the world, creating hit singles of their own and already playing as background artists and for such legendary artists as Otis Redding, Elton John, Santana, the Grateful Dead, John Lee Hooker, Aerosmith, Bonnie Raitt and countless others. During this process, they defined an “Oakland soul” sound as recognizable as Castillo's hometown of Detroit and inspirations like Memphis and Philadelphia.

Known for their fantastic live performances, the band will undoubtedly provide an evening you won't soon forget!
