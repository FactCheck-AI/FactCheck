The second of our characters is Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Ibn Nasr. With Muhammad I we see the beginning of the Muslim period in the Iberian Peninsula.

Muhammad Ibn Yusuf Ibn Nasr was born in the neighbouring province of Jaen, in Arjona in 1194. He was the founder of the Nasrid Dynasty. Moreover, he also became the first Sultan in the Kingdom of Granada between the years 1238 and 1273.

Ibn Nasr

He was known by various names or nicknames – Muhammad I, Ibn Al-Ahmar (son of the red one), or as Alhamar because of the colour of his beard. Historians tell us that what is now known as the Alcazaba which Muhammad had built on Sabika Hill was named The Alhambra in his honour. The Alhambra means ‘the red’. He also had the watering system that fed the city built which is known as the Acequia Real or Royal Canal.

Despite descending from a noble family he was said to be an agriculturalist. He devoted his time to cultivating his parents’ land with his own hands. Later he was in command of the troops in battles against attacks by the Catholic Kings. In 1228 Ibn Hud reigned over all al-Andalus.

After various defeats the young Muhammad conquered the king of the Taifa of Murcia and he became king of the Taifa of Arjona. After that he also took the cities of Almeria, Malaga and Granada.

In 1238 he entered Granada via the Puerta de Elvira triumphantly crying ‘There is no victor other than God’. From then on the people knew him as ‘Wa-lā gālib illà Allāh‘ ‘God’s victorious one’. Finally, it that became the slogan of the Nasrid Dynasty.

Muhammad I died after falling from a horse in Granada in 1273. However, his legacy that we still enjoy today.
