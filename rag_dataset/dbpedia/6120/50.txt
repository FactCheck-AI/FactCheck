The blue label carts are US versions. Sega of America released a number of titles with blue labels as well as (or instead of) the red ones.

But I had a red labeled cart and all the people I met had a red labeled carts. I like the black and (brownish) red feeling of the SMS because its the color combination I remember.

I think the blue labels are australian.

I had a US red Double Dragon cart before & saw only red DD carts in the past... I have NO clue as to where the blue ones come from... maybe brasil? Any brasilian reading this?

I agree with Mike... I know it sounds odd since 99% of American SMS games had the reddish labels, (minus the Parker Bros. games) BUT a few of the games had a blue label variation. Why? I have no clue...

How do I know it's actually American then? I have a blue label version of an American only game - Reggie Jackson Baseball. Everywhere else it was American Baseball. There are a couple of other minor variations too with the box & manual I believe, but I'll have to double check it against my regular copy (it's been a while since I compared the two).

Damn right.

That doesn't mean that other types of labels didn't exist. I think that re-releases and circa 1990 games had blue labels.

Yes, Australia has many blue labels, such as Sonic, Sonic 2 and Wonderboy 3.

There are two kinds that I know of. The first has the name of the game on top, and the front looks like this (sorry my scanner's packed away somewhere, but I drew a somewhat accurate rendition. The fonts are wrong, but bad luck ay):

Note that not all say 'Wonderboy 3: Dragon's Trap' on them. The second doesn't have a name on the front, and bloody hell mate if you're like me and never look at the top (like with Mega Drive games) of Sega cartridges you'd wonder what game it was. This one's on my Asterix and the Great Rescue cartridge:

So in conclusion, Ozisoft wanted to scam game owners with absolute rip-off phone lines. Not to mention the fact that Australian blue labels are quite different from US ones.

By the way, sorry about the dodgy pictures.

the post below is the best explanation for the blue label ozi carts ive seen yet; but as a side note the typical (red) ozisoft label is red with white lines (lesser quality tho)

The limited edition blue box of Power strike had a normal red cart in... That is, the one I have though.

That explains why I never saw them. I returned to the Commodore 64 to play Last Ninja 3. Shinobi? Who is that? Armakuni was back and the world was a better place those days. My SMS collection was limited to Double Dragon, Rescue Mission, Ghostbusters, Hang On and Safari Hunt.

But if for some odd reason Richard C.C. is reading (you know who I am from my nickname. Godzilla remember?) on this messageboard (and I know you probably are you SEGA freak) I think Rambo First blood part 2 kicked ass. If you didnÂ´t like it you should have given it to me, you idiot. And I donÂ´t feel sorry for burning that NES Amagon cart on the microwave, bitch (that thing got like a ball of gray plastic and bubbly for just a few seconds).

95 cents a minute phones advertised on a cart! Poor australians. Is the videogame market still this fucked up in Australia? I think I know the nationality of the people running Game Spy and IGN.

95 cents

Well... that's Australian cents. A quick conversion at today's prices gives 45 US cents, 35p in the UK or 56 cents in countries using the Euro.

The Australian dollar is so devaluated! Is the economy still this fucked up in Australia? I think now I know the nationality of the accountants Sega had during the late 90Â´s.

I thought the original mail order version of Power Strike had a black and white case, but I don't know because I've never seen one.

I've never seen a US blue cart either, though...
