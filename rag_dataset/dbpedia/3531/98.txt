This is a wisecrack-packed picture in which Chan solves the murder of a wealthy American found dead in a London hotel. Warren Hymer as a Chicago racketeer provides laughs throughout. When wife White comes trotting down a Hong Kong street carrying a bundle which turns out to be a reading lamp he quips, "I suppose she'll buy a book now." "No," the lady says, "I've already got one." This nicely photographed film has an abundance of foreign backgrounds with various interiors at Nice, San Remo, London, Honolulu, and Hong Kong. Fast paced and snappy.
