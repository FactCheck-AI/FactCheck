PHOTO COLLECTION OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE

There are numerous photos related to the Armenian genocide taken by various eyewitnesses and included in the holdings of many archives worldwide, particularly Russian, German, Austrian, American, Norwegian, Armenian and others. Taking into account the period of the tragic events, when photo cameras were not available for everyone, especially in the war time period and in the places out of the main urban centers, those photos represent as the most important evidence of the tragedy of Armenian nation. During the WWI the Turkish government strongly prohibited taking any photos of Armenian deportees or bodies of those, who were killed or died during the death marches. Nevertheless there are hundreds of photo evidences of the Armenian genocide, which are the main visual sources of the "the first ideologically motivated genocide of the 20th century".

Every year dozens of new photo materials are revealed from various sources.
