Ankara prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation against an opposition deputy over his remarks about military coups and incidents of bombing civilians.

Sezgin Tanr覺kulu, a long-serving MP with the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), is facing charges of "degrading the Turkish nation and state" and "provoking the public to hatred and hostility."

The investigation stems from Tanr覺kulu's comments during a program on TV100 on Friday. He had remarked, "Nothing the TSK [Turkish Armed Forces] did is immune to criticism. As members of parliament, it is our duty to question these actions. Was it not the TSK that staged the coup on September 12 [1980]? Was it not this military that attempted the coup on July 15 [2016], burned down villages [in the 1990s], and threw 15 villagers out of helicopters, as confirmed by the ECtHR ruling? The [2011] Roboski [massacre] happened most recently.

"We approach this critically. We ask questions, we inquire about the accuracy of the information, and we do so with the aim of removing any doubts about the TSK. If everything had been done correctly over the past 40 years, Turkey would not be in this situation."

Tanr覺kulu was subjected to targeted harassment on social media and heavily criticized by pro-government media outlets after his statements. He said on social media that "I'll settle accounts with those who made statements about me that were beyond heavy criticism."

As a human rights lawyer, Tanr覺kulu has focused on rights violations during his tenure as an MP since 2011. He has faced several investigations over the years for reasons similar to the latest one. (NT/VK)
