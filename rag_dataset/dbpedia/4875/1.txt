Benjamin Harrison (1833-1901), the grandson of former president William Henry Harrison and the great-grandson of Benjamin Harrison V, who had signed the Declaration of Independence.

He served as the 23rd president from 1889 to 1893.

Harrison defeated Grover Cleveland in the electoral college (albeit not in the popular vote) in 1888, but lost both the popular and electoral college vote to him in the 1892 presidential election.

Born in Ohio, Harrison attended Farmers’ College, completed his bachelor’s degree at Miami of Ohio, read law and was admitted to the bar.

After he married, Harrison moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where he transitioned from supporting the Whig Party to the Republican Party. He served in the Union Army during the Civil War, inspired his men in combat, and was promoted to brevet brigadier general. He was chosen to be a U.S. senator from Indiana from 1881 to 1887.

In a speech that he delivered in Indianapolis on Aug. 7, 1888, when running for president, Harrison observed that: “The Republican party did not organize for spoils; it assembled about an altar of sacrifice and in a sanctuary beset with enemies. You have not forgotten our early battle-cry — ‘Free speech, a free press, free schools and free Territories.’ We have widened the last word; it is now ‘a free Nation’” (Speeches of Benjamin Harrison, p. 78).

Harrison was a devout Presbyterian. In his inaugural address, he drew upon Presbyterian theology when he proclaimed that his oath “taken in the presence of the people becomes a mutual covenant. The officer covenants to serve the whole body of the people by a faithful execution of the laws, so that they may be the unfailing defense and security of those who respect and observe them, and that neither wealth, station, nor the power of combinations shall be able to evade their just penalties or to wrest from them a beneficent public purpose to serve the ends of cruelty or selfishness” (Inaugural Address, March 4, 1889).
