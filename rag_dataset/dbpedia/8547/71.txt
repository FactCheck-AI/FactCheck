Set against the backdrop of the early 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. centers on the relationship between CIA agent Napoleon Solo and KGB agent Illya Kuryakin, played by swoon-worthies Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer.

Forced to put aside longstanding hostilities, these two find themselves teamed up on a joint mission to stop a mysterious international criminal organization in this fast-moving, action-packed, sexy and stylish international thriller.

And although a bond forges eventually, there's a rocky relationship between the two sexy super-spies; in fact, the first time we see them, they are trying to kill each other.

On the surface, these two don't seem to have anything in common. They are like oil and water – but one thing they certainly both have is spectacular sex appeal. It should be noted here that attempting to choose between Armie Hammer and Henry Cavill is like choosing between a Louboutin and a Brian Atwood – it's very much a win win situation.

But in the definitive breakdown of hotness – are you Team Napoleon or Team Illya?

And whichever character you end up swooning over, you really can't go wrong. You might even decide you fancy both of them.

After all, as star Henry Cavill says: 'In some ways they're two sides of the same coin. The differences in their personalities and methods are vast, but they're on the same spectrum. And even though they're in this because they have no choice, they are always mindful that they have a mission and there are lives at stake, so they have to try to make their skills work together.
