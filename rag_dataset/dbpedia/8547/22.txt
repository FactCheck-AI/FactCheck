Man of Steel's Henry Cavill has stepped in to replace Tom Cruise in the feature film version of the classic spy-fi TV series The Man From U.N.C.L.E. Variety reports that Cavill will star as secret agent Napoleon Solo opposite The Lone Ranger's Armie Hammer as Ilya Kuryakin in the Guy Ritchie-directed action movie. Solo and Kuryakin are operatives for the United Network Command for Law & Enforcement.

Cruise recently dropped out to focus on producing and starring in Mission: Impossible V instead.

Cavill, who was the runner-up to play 007 in Casino Royale, recently expressed his keenness to still play James Bond one day. Perhaps The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is either his training ground for taking over the role in the future or the closest he'll get to it.
