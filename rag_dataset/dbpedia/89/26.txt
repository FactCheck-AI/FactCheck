SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. - The National Weather Service in Reno has issued a new Winter Weather Advisory for Monday at 4:00 p.m. to Tuesday morning at 4:00 a.m. This new advisory is due to what is known as "lake effect snow." Six more inches of snow can drop on the south shore of Lake Tahoe area this evening.

Lake effect occurs when a mass of unstable cold air moves over a mass of water that is warm in comparison. The lake provides moisture for the band of weather moving over it.

The wind Monday will be coming from the northwest, giving it the length of the lake to gather moisture. The unstable conditions could produce heavy snowfall rates at times.

As of 4:00 p.m., the biggest band is from Glenbrook to Stateline but it can quickly change areas depending on the flow of the wind. NWS Reno said the bands will change, develop, move and be spotty overnights.

Where the band sets up and persists will see the six inches of snow.
