As part of Pride History Month and in honor of National Coming Out Day, the Lewes Public Library, CAMP Rehoboth, Women’s March Sussex - DE are hosting a screening of Stonewall Uprising Friday, Oct. 11, at 6 p.m.

Written by David Heilbroner and directed by Kate Davis and Heilbroner, this film was based on the book “Stonewall: The Riots that Sparked the Gay Revolution.” The film first aired on PBS’ American Experience and has a running time of 83 minutes.

This year marks 50 years since the events in this film, events that became a major turning point in the modern gay civil rights movement. When police raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular gay bar in the Greenwich Village section of New York City June 28, 1969, the street erupted into violent protests that lasted for the next six days. The Stonewall riots, as they came to be known, marked a major turning point in the modern gay civil rights movement in the United States and around the world.
