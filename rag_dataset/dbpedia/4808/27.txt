The web-hosting company that was founded in the AUBG dorms by Ivo Tzenov and university friends in 2004 has reached its 15th anniversary. Following a Work & Travel summer in US, the then students embarked on starting together a business and building up a company the way they see and feel right, doing something they really enjoy with people they like.

Fast-forward 15 years, Siteground now hosts over 2 million domains on their servers, with 500 people in the ranks, data centers in the US, Netherlands, UK, and Singapore, and local offices in Spain and Italy in addition to Bulgaria. Congratulations on the successes and for many more to come!
