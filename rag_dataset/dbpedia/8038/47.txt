Victor Hugo was a noteworthy writer (1802-1885). Hugo is famous for the works he wrote, including The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Les Misérables. Although he has yet to appear in Gargoyles, his works have been referenced in the series.

Real World Background

In addition to his works of literature, Hugo was also a politician. Initially a supporter of the monarchy, he later favored republicanism but over time became disillusioned with whoever was in power. He would live in exile for nearly thirty years due his criticisms of France's various governments. Throughout his life, Hugo publicly advocated for universal suffrage, free education for children, and the abolition of capital punishment and slavery. [1]

In an 1864 work dedicated to William Shakespeare, Hugo referred to the Bard as "L'Homme Océan" ("the Ocean Man"), comparing the feat of trying to fathom the Bard's genius to that of observing the ocean. The nickname would be applied to Hugo himself later in his lifetime.
