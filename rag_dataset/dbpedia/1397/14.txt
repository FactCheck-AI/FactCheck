Non-SI unit

Name Symbol Quantity SI units light year ly length 9 460 730 472 580 800 m The light year, symbol ly, is a non-SI unit of length. The light year is not accepted for use with the SI.

One light year is defined as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of one Julian year, 365.25 days, or 31 557 600 seconds.

One light year is equal to 9 460 730 472 580 800 m, or approximately 9.46 petametres. Definition c ΔνCs-1

The length in metres of one light year is calculated by multiplying the speed of light in vacuum, c, by the number of seconds in one Julian year:

Defining constants

The metre is defined by the equation:

Multiplying both sides of the equation by the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum gives the definition for the distance travelled by light in one second. This distance is known as a light second.

The definition for the light year can then be obtained by multiplying both sides of the equation by 31 557 600, the number of seconds in a Julian year:

Astronomy

The light year is used in the field of astronomy, primarily to express distances on interstellar and intergalactic scales.
