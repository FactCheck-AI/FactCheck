The most prominent example of presentation software is Microsoft PowerPoint. Other examples include Apple Keynote, OpenOffice Impress, Corel Presentations, Adobe Persuasion, Flowboard, Kingsoft Presentation and Prezi.

Presentation software generally is used to create slide shows for business and academic purposes. These slides incorporate text, graphics and sometimes even embedded audio and video. Presentation software packages should be chosen based on the specific purpose of the presentation and the userâ€™s technical knowledge and comfort level with it. The ones previously listed are the most prominent, but other examples include Google Docs (which is free but requires the user to be online and signed into a Google account to use), LibreOffice Impress, Ease, Hewlett Packard Bruno, SlideRocket and Aquasoft SlideShow.
