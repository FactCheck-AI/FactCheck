Lotus 18 - Signed Leather-bound Limited Edition

Written by Ian Wagstaff

This fabulous book tells the story of the Lotus 18 which Stirling Moss achieved two of his most famous Grand Prix victories. The first World Championship race of the 1½-litre Formula 1 era introduced for 1961 was the Monaco Grand Prix and Ferrari’s powerful new ‘shark-nose’ cars were expected to dominate it, but Moss used all his craft and guile to take a celebrated win in his Lotus 18.

A stunning special Limited Edition which is bound in dark blue leather with gilt edges, and cased in a grey cloth slipcase. There is an embossed reproduction of the chassis number, '912' on the front of the book. This leather-bound edition is limited to just 100 copies and is signed by the author.
