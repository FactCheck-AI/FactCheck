The Ukraine women's national team has concluded their training camp in Rzeszow, Poland, ahead of their final two group-stage matches in the EURO 2025 qualifiers.

Head coach of the Ukrainian women's team, Volodymyr Pyatenko, provided updates to the UAF official website on the team's preparations:

— We've accomplished everything planned in Rzeszow. We must have avoided injuries, although there were some colds, but there's still time for recovery.

— Did you call up all the strongest players to Poland?

— Unfortunately, due to injuries, Victoriya Hiryn, Iryna Mayborodina, and Natiya Pantsulaya won't be able to help us. However, this week could mark the debut in the national team for Lesya Olkhova. By the way, she was called up for the previous training camp, but she was unable to come due to injury. Now, she is fine.

— On July 12, your charges will play an away match against Kosovo...

— On July 10, we left Krakow, transited through Vienna, and headed to Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, where two training sessions were planned. On the day of the match, we will travel about 100 km by bus to Pristina — the venue of the meeting with the Kosovar women. Then we will return to Skopje, where on July 16, we will play against the Croatians.

— Are our nearest opponents similar in style of play?

— Yes, mostly they act from defense, are hard in tackling, and often resort to the tactic of small fouls. They are uncomfortable opponents. We will try to tilt the balance in our favor by quick transitions from defense to attack, vertical passes, and activity on the flanks...

— Will this allow you to guarantee a place in League B?

— Currently, two wins keep chances alive for the top spot in the group. Therefore, I will only tune my charges to achieve the maximum result.

The first of the two planned matches, Kosovo vs Ukraine, will take place on July 12 in Pristina at the local Fadil Vokrri Stadium. Kick-off time is at 19:00 Kyiv time.

The match Ukraine vs Croatia will be played on July 16 in Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, at the stadium of the local football federation's training center. Kick-off time is at 20:00 Kyiv time.

The distribution of tickets for EURO 2025 takes place based on the results of the next league cycle. The teams compete in groups of four or three teams (League C). The eight best teams in League A (first and second places) immediately go to the final tournament. There they join the host country, Switzerland.

The remaining seven passes are to be played in two rounds of playoffs. In the one-way first round, the third- and fourth-placed teams in League A face the group winners and the top three second-placed teams in League C. The eight winners advance to the second round.

Elsewhere, the four group winners and the top two runners-up in League B play the remaining two runners-up and the four third-placed teams in League B. The six winners advance to the second round.

In the second round of the playoffs, 14 national teams directly play for seven tickets to the final tournament of EURO 2025, where a total of 16 participants play.

The paths of the teams in the play-off matches are to be adjusted, if necessary, taking into account the performances of Switzerland, which plays in League B, but will be represented at the Euro as the host country.

If Switzerland finishes first, second, or third in their B League group, the fourth-best team from that division will enter the playoffs.

Promotion and relegation

In parallel, teams will also compete for positions in the next Nations League, which begins the 2025-2027 cycle:

— winners, holders of second and third places in League A groups will remain in League A;

— the second-place winners and the three best third-place winners in League B groups will remain in League B;

— the winners of the second, third, and fourth places in the groups of League C will remain in League C;

— the winners of the groups in the B and C leagues will move to the higher division;

— the fourth-place finishers in League A and B groups, as well as the worst third-place finisher in League B, will be relegated.
