What Happens After Canceling a TIME Magazine Subscription?

After canceling your TIME subscription, you will stop receiving new issues of the magazine, and your provided payment method won't be charged moving forward. You should also note that depending on the terms of the offer you accept, you may be eligible for a refund after terminating your subscription. If you have a print subscription where refunds are offered, you will receive a refund for unserved issues or issues that are yet to be processed for fulfillment.

How Virtual Cards Help You Manage Subscription Payments Effectively

Troubles when canceling subscription services are not uncommon, with most issues stemming from honest errors, miscommunication, or technical hitches. Unfortunately, some companies may intentionally employ deceptive practices to prolong the cancellation process and deter you from leaving so that you can continue paying for their services.

These companies often have specific cancellation requirements, which may include the following:

Requiring you to call customer service during specific hours and keeping you on hold

Requiring you to visit a specific physical location for cancellation

Making the cancellation buttons unnoticeable on their website

Using guilting language to make you rethink your decision to cancel

Offering you special benefits or discounts to tempt you into staying

These delay tactics may result in you getting charged for another month of services you are no longer interested in. To protect yourself from accidental and intentional charges, consider using Privacy Virtual Cards to pay for your subscriptions.Â

While connected to a real bank account or debit card, virtual cards replace your actual financial information with fake card numbers, adding a layer of security around your online transactions. Comprehensive virtual card providers like Privacy also offer robust spending control features that can help you avoid unexpected charges from any subscription-based company.

Stop Excessive Subscription Payments With Privacy Virtual Cards

Privacy Virtual Cards give you the ability to define how much a company can charge you, helping you protect your financial account from unexpected payments. You can use Privacy Virtual Cards for various subscriptions, including other publications like the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times, and streaming services such as Apple TV, Apple Music, PlayStation Plus, and Philo.Â

Privacy allows you to generate two types of virtual cardsârefer to the table below for more information about them:

Privacy Cards come with the following features, which are helpful for managing your subscription expenses:

Card pausing/closingâWhen stopping a subscription, you can pause or close the card you used when signing up, and Privacy will block all future charge attempts on said card. This feature lets you focus on the cancellation process without worrying about the merchant imposing charges during and after canceling.

Spending limitâBy setting a spending limit, you can control how much a merchant can bill you for their services. Privacy will decline all transactions that exceed your preset limit. That includes accidental double charges for the same month, price increases you had no prior notification about, and other hidden fees.
