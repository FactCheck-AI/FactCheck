Rare original Holland pressed cd single

Considered to be one of England’s best drummers, and very much in demand for rock and pop records, Cozy Powell was almost legendary for a heavy-hitting style that could be made to work with many kinds of rock music, whether for the thundering pop productions helmed by Mickie Most, Black Sabbath, Emerson, Lake And Powell, or even his own solo work (notably Dance with the Devil, which was a major English hit in 1973). His fourth and last solo album The Drums Are Back (1992), was recorded between Powell’s two stints with Black Sabbath, and following its release he took a band on the road under the name Cozy Powell’s Hammer. The title track here are a heavy drum laden instrumental backed up by a lightweight rock number with vocals by Gerry Lane ((Driveshaft/Gerry Lane Band). Besides Cozy Powell and Gerry Lane we find the following amazing line-up of musicians: Neil Murray – Bass Guitar (Whitesnake/Gary Moore) Geoff Nicholls – Keyboards, sequencing and programming (Black Sabbath/Quartz) Steve Makin – Guitar, bass (Slade) John Sinclair – Keyboards (Uriah Heep/Ozzy Osbourne) Jamie Paige – Guitar (Black Alice)
