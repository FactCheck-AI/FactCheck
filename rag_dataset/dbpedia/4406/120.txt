In the best of all possible worlds, teams are formed deliberately and carefully to meet work needs that an individual or a group of individuals cannot meet as effectively. Although many groups are called "teams," not every work group is a team. In a work group, performance is a function of what its members do as individuals. The focus in a work group is individual goals and accountabilities. A team's performance is measured primarily by the products produced collectively by the team.

Teams share certain characteristics, including a clearly defined purpose (mission) and goals. Teamwork is defined by a shared commitment both to the team's process (how the team works together) and to its product (what work the team accomplishes). This commitment to team process is demonstrated through the development and use of team norms and groundrules, a willingness to pay attention to group process, and a sense of mutual accountability both to the members of the team as individuals and the team as a whole.

Types of Teams

Project teams are usually time-limited teams formed to complete a particular task. When the team completes its task, it disbands. Standing teams (sometimes called "intact" teams) are formed as ongoing organizational units. Teams that bring together members from different departments or functions are called cross-functional teams.

What Makes a Team Successful?

There are several factors identified as key to a team's success. They include:

Shared understanding of the team's mission

Commitment to the team's goals

Clearly defined roles and responsibilities

Agreed-upon groundrules

An established decision-making model

Effective group process including commitment to open communication, mutual accountability and appropriate self-evaluation (see the Communicating with Others learning topic for more on open communication)
