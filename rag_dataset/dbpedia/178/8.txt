J.B. Cassidy

Died: 24 Mar 1841 Village Creek, Tarrant County, Texas.[1][2][3]

Killed by Indians while on a scouting expedition with Henry Stout. Sometimes called "Batttle of Village Creek," but it was only a small, brief skirmish.

Handbook of Texas says he was killed while leading a company of Gen. Tarrant's militia in an organized attack on Keechi Village, and was struck by a rifle ball in the chest, dying instantly. This conflicts with the later account of Henry Stout, who helped bury him at the confluence of Oliver Creek & Denton Creek.

Buried: County Courthouse, Denton, Denton County, Texas.[1][2][3]

Originally buried in an unmarked grave near the confluence of Oliver Creek & Denton Creek. Henry B. Stout, about 30 years later, was able to relocate Denton's grave, and the remains were reburied by John S. Chisum in a wooden box in the corner of the yard of his home on Clear Creek, near Bolivar. In 1901, the Pioneer Association of Denton County, after diligent search and thorough careful identification, again removed the remains and buried them with appropriate ceremonies in the southeast corner of the Denton County Courthouse lawn.

Probate: Nov 18484 Clarksville, Red River County, Texas.[9]

John D. Craig appointed executor of his estate in regard to some land he owned in Harrison County.
