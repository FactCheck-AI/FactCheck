An automated collection uses selection conditions to automatically include matching products. You can add up to 60 selection conditions, and you can specify whether products need to meet all conditions or any condition to be included in the collection.

If you want to choose specific products for a collection, then you can create a manual collection instead.

The Shopify Starter plan doesn't support grouping your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. If you require the ability to create collections, then you need to upgrade to a higher plan such as Basic Shopify, Shopify, Advanced Shopify, or Shopify Plus.
