Dr Andrew Lindridge - Principal Investigator

Reader in Marketing, Newcastle Business School, Newcastle University, London.

​

Andrew’s research interests focus on the marginalised consumer, i.e. consumers who feel unable or unwilling to identify with the consumer market, or who the market intentionally excludes owing to cultural, economic, political, religious, or social reasons. An interest that has led to researching marginalised consumers in Britain, China, France, India, and the United States on a variety of consumption topics ranging from: ethnic minorities and alcoholism, inter-generational rifts within ethnic minorities, and how David Bowie fans use his music to reimagine their own past.

Dr Anoop Bhogal-Nair

Senior Lecturer in Marketing & Consumption, Leicester Castle Business School, De Montfort University.

​

Anoop's research interests center upon her interests in understanding how consumers negotiate and consume both their sense of physical being and their self-identity within the spaces they occupy. To date her work has focused upon Indian female consumers, religious minorities (Sikh disapora) and marginalised groups (disability). Much of Anoop's research takes an inter-disciplinary perspective - cultural studies, sociology, history and religion - focusing on the challenges, threats and opportunities consumers experience in their daily lives as individuals.

Steve carries out research in sub Saharan Africa and India. He is an expert around analysing data from large samples using advanced statistical techniques using both STATA and SPSS.
