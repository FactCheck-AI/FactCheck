American pianist Kenny Drew, who moved from the U.S. to Europe in the 1960s and gained high acclaim, collaborated with his friend, Danish bassist Neils-Henning Orsted Pedersen, and released a duo album on SteepleChase in 1973. The album features Drew's piano solo, Pedersen's bass solo, and duo from the original score, as well as traditional numbers. Special features include B2, a cover of a classic bossa tune with electric piano backing and acoustic piano melody, and B4, a groovy blues tune that also features an extensive introduction of electric piano. This is an original Danish pressing with no box line on the SteepleChase logo on the label.

B2 : Wave

B4: Hush-a-bye
