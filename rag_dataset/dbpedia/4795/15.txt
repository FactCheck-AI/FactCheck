Nanaulu, a descendandt in the fourteenth generation from Wakea, was the ancester of Moikeha, 1st Alii Aimoku of Kauai, but his dynasty was surplanted after two generations. The second, or Puna, dynasty was established by La'amaikahiki, eleventh in descent from Puna. In 1810, King Kaumualii, the 23rd Alii Aimoku of Kauai, ceded his kingdom to King Kamehameha I of Hawaii, in an effort to avoid bloodshed. Thereafter, he ruled as a tributary, until kidnapped by King Kamehameha II and taken to Honolulu in 1821. After his death in 1 824, his son and heir, attempted to re-establish his independence on Kauai, but was also eventually captured and taken to Honolulu. Ironically, the rights to the crown of the Hawaiian islands now rest with Kaumualii's heirs.
