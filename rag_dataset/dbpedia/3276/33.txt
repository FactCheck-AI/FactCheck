It's been 25 years since The Day Today first hit screens.

And to make the anniversary, the stars of the spoof current affairs and news show have come together for a team selfie.

The cult satire helped launch the careers of Rebecca Front, Armando Iannucci, Doon Mackichan, Peter Baynham, Patrick Marber, Steve Coogan, Chris Morris and David Schneider.

The team's grainy selfie has been posted on Twitter reports the Manchester Evening News .

The image has been celebrated by fans of the parody show which hit our screens on BB2 with its so-bonkers-it-could-be-true take on the modern world.

As quickly as it arrived, it had gone, in just six episodes, leaving behind both an indelible mark on the face of British comedy, and the hilarious gift that keeps on giving, Alan Patridge.

So what has the original cast been up to since the sun set on The Day Today:

Chris Morris

It launched Morris's iconic character, the self-important anchor who targeted guests and even his own news team.

After The Day Today, Morris developed the satirical news format with Brass Eye, which lampooned celebrities while focusing on big themes such as crime and drugs.

The episode Morris will be remembered for most was the Brass Eye special, which dealt with the moral panic surrounding paedophilia, and became one of the most complained about programmes in British television history.

Morris then helped create Nathan Barley, a sitcom which satirised hipsters, which he co-wrote with Charlie Brooker.

He also had an acting role in The IT Crowd before going on to direct his first feature-length film, Four Lions, which satirised Islamic terrorism.
