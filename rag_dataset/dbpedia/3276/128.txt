Smack The Pony actress Doon Mackichan is to join Tamsin Greig in April De Angelis’s new play Jumpy, which opens at the Royal Court next month.

The funny family drama about a 50-year-old wife and mother whose life has changed since her days protesting at Greenham also stars Seline Hizli, Richard Lintern, Michael Marcus, James Musgrave, Bel Powley, Ewan Stewart and Sarah Woodward.

Mackichan, who plays the best friend of Greig’s Hilary, last appeared at the Royal Court in The Queen And I and was recently seen in the Young Vic’s production of The Government Inspector. She is best known, however, for her TV appearances in shows including The Day Today and Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge.

Jumpy also marks the Royal Court returns of James Musgrave (previously seen in Wanderlust), Bel Powley (previously seen in Tusk Tusk) and Ewan Stewart (previously seen in Road).

Directed by Nina Raine, Jumpy runs at the Royal Court Jerwood Theatre Downstairs from 13 October, following the run of current hit show The Faith Machine.
