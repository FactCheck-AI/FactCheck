thereallarryhankin.comdeluxeedition.showLarry Hankin is a writer, performer, director, producer and Oscar-nominee – and one of Hollywood’s most recognizable faces in the world of character actors.Larry graduated as an industrial designer from Syracuse University, moved to Greenwich Village with his College Buddy, Carl Gottlieb (who would later write the movie “Jaws”, among others). Once there, Larry started doing stand-up in coffeehouses, and was soon opening for Woody Allen and Miles Davis. He then joined Second City in Chicago, bolted from there to San Francisco with 6 other Second City Runaways and started “The Committee”, a rival improv group.From there, Larry drifted down to Los Angeles, slept on couches for a few months and, when Penny Marshal needed a tall guy to do a comic dance with on “Laverne and Shirley”, she recalled seeing Larry in “The Committee” in S.F. and invited him on, which got him an agent, and, “I officially became a working actor in Hollywood.”One of his first jobs after that was “Charley Butz”, a co-starring lead in “Escape from Alcatraz”. His first big paycheck in hand, Larry took a dare from a friend who’s husband was a young camera operator needing “…footage for my cinematography reel”. she dared him to write a film short for himself to direct, play the lead, and produce with her husband as cinematographer, Harry Mathias. one year later their short, “Solly’s Diner”, was nominated for an Academy Award.Larry has appeared in over 180 films and TV Shows from “Friends” and “Seinfeld” (“Mr. Heckles” and “The Guy Who Stole The Raisins”), to “CSI”, the junkyard owner who crushed the winnebago and sold the huge magnet in “Breaking Bad,” the Russian hitman Slovka in episode 3 of Bill Hader’s Barry, and recently, reprized his role as go-for-Joe, the junkyard dealer in Netflix movie, “El Camino.”And all-the-while, Larry’s been exploring 2 characters of his own storytelling invention: one is feisty, old, “Emmett Deemus” (“Don Quixote on a motorcycle”, in 3, 10-min. film short “episodes” of, “The Outlaw Emmett Deemus” and as a homeless panhandler in “Emmett” in Peopleland” on Vimeo). The second, “Sometimes Jones” is in a set of funny fables about a young runaway, “The Quirky Fables of Sometimes Jones”, growing into manhood on the streets of an amazingly illogical and ridiculous world.Exploring both on stage and in his one-man show, “Street Stories”, and Support the show
