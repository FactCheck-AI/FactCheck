1994 - 2000 Special Year on

Mathematical Support for Molecular Biology

PLEASE REVIEW CALENDAR IN ITS ENTIRETY FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION, i.e. locations, times, abstracts of talks.

Locations of Events: Events are to be held at CoRE Building, Busch Campus, Rutgers University, except as noted.

Special Year Seminar Series:

Starting in September, 1995, there will be a special year seminar every Monday at 11 A.M., except when there is a workshop, miniworkshop, or Distinguished Lecture Series Lecture scheduled. Most seminars will be at Rutgers, but some will be at the Princeton University Computer Science Building or at the Waksman Institute for Molecular Genetics at Rutgers, and others will be at the Genome Center at University of Pennsylvania.
