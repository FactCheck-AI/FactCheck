The Sluice is like a trough on the side of the building, which takes its water from the mill pond and stores it until the lever to begin the milling procedure is pulled.

The Atlas Mill is operated by water-driven turbine beneath the water surface so the mill can operate in winter if the surface of the water is frozen.

Due to the modernization, the sluice no longer runs. Here is the exterior of the "Piatt and Son" mill, once located in

Laingsburg, Michigan (near Lansing).

This photo has an excellent view of horse and carts lined up with sacks of grain

ready to be ground.

A true picture of the past! Seymour Piatt (Scott's great-grandfather), and his son (Scott's great uncle) Lloyd Piatt in the mill office. As you can see, the oh-so-important cat got into the picture as well. Named after the Farris family, who ran this mill

for three generations, this windmill, built in 1633,

is said to be the oldest of its kind in the United States,

and stood at the road to West Yarmouth, Massachusetts.

It now stands at the southeast end of Greenfield Village,

right next to the 1750 Daggett House. As the Daggett House and Farris Windmill are situated inside Greenfield Village,

as seen in the above picture, they give a strong resemblance to the

East Hampton, NY historic landmark home of John Howard Payne, composer

of 'Home Sweet Home' (as seen in the photo below).
