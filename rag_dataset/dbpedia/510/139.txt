The Atlas Brass Mill is beautiful kitchen tool suitable for chefs and beginner cooks alike. The handmade grinding mechanism is designed to maximize flavor and aroma, producing a generous amount of salt or pepper with each turn of the handle.

Features adjustable grinding from fine-to-coarse. Each mill has a flanged base for stability and a durable all metal body. Please note that due to the natural chrome material, these mills will age and patina over time.

WHY WE LOVE IT

Atlas Mills are the origin of the phrase pepper grinder since these mills actually grind the pepper. Common pepper mills only smash the peppercorns which severely limits the flavor release. The Atlas mill is a unique piece of European tradition that is functionally the best in the world.
