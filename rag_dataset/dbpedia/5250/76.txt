It saddens us here at TFW2005 to bring you the news that voice actor and legendary radio star, Casey Kasem, has passed away at the age of 82. If you were a fan of the original Transformers cartoon, Casey Kasem provided the voices for Cliffjumper, Bluestreak, Dr. Arkeville and Teletraan-1. He was also known for his roles as Shaggy on Scooby Doo and Robin on the Super-Friends. Outside of voice acting, he was known as the host of American Top 40 and had one of the most prolific careers in radio history. Unfortunately, the last several months of Casey’s life has had it’s share in drama. In October of last year, he was diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia. A disease often confused with Parkinson’s. The disease left Kasem unable to speak. On June 12th, his family took him off of life support, and he passed away earlier today.

Our condolences go out to his family, friends and fans. One last long distance dedication from us here at TFW, thanks for getting Megatron dead set in your view finder!
