Scooby (Frank Welker, who also voices Freddie), Shaggy (Casey Kasem) and the rest of the gang set out on what they hope to be a relaxing, mystery-free cruise. But then terrified scientist Rupert Garcia (Freddy Rodriguez) is plucked out of the water and warns about a group of "ghost pirates." And shipboard magician/hypnotist, Mr. Mysterioso (Dan Castellaneta) seems a little too mysterious for his own good. Before long, pirates overtake the ship and kidnap passengers and crew members. Scooby and the gang must find the pirates' secret lair and save the day, but not before braving the mysterious Bermuda Triangle. As the friends battle the ghost pirates -- led by the menacing Captain Skunkbeard (Ron Perlman) -- they also encounter other entities that have disappeared into the triangle, including phantom World War II-era fighter planes and a giant sea serpent.
