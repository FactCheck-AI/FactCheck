America has a national treasure, and her name is RuPaul Andre Charles. Born November 17, 1960, she's TV's greatest drag queen, and she's been around the block once or twice. Naturally, she's accumulated some crazy, hilarious, and weird stories.

Since RuPaul's Drag Race began in 2009, she's met plenty of crazy queens and accumulated some buckwild RuPaul tales. It's not uncommon for celebrities to have some weird quirks, but Ru takes things to a new level with her life story.

For instance, Ru used to be in a punk band, and she's also been on an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger. She was once dubbed the Queen of Manhattan, but she also won best afro. She's one of the most famous drag queens on the planet, and she's named after... gumbo?

The world is a strange place, and Ru only makes it stranger. But hey, we were all born naked, and the rest is drag.
