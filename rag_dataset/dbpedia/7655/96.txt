It peaked at #45 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and at #2 on the "Billboard" Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

RuPaul returned to television in February 2009 with the reality television competition show "RuPaul's Drag Race," which initially aired on Logo. The premise of the program is that drag queens compete to be selected by a panel of judges (which includes RuPaul) as "America's next drag superstar." RuPaul's long-time collaborator, Michelle Visage, is a member of the judging panel. The show was the highest-rated television program on Logo TV and has aired internationally in countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and Israel.
