A native of Mexico City, Enrique Olvera graduated from The Culinary Institute of America in 1997, and is the chef-owner of Pujol, Eno Petrarca, and Eno Virreyes, in Mexico City, Maíz de Mar in Playa del Carmen, and Cosme in New York City. Chef Olvera’s reinterpretation of Mexico’s popular recipes as well as his experimentation with contemporary and millennia-old culinary techniques, has brought him fame well beyond the nation’s borders. Pujol has steadily climbed Restaurant Magazine’s World’s 50 Best Restaurant list—a first for a Mexican restaurant with a Mexican chef—reaching number 16 in 2015. Chef Olvera’s culinary philosophy has been defined by his deep exploration of Mexico’s universe of ingredients, and gastronomic techniques and traditions.
