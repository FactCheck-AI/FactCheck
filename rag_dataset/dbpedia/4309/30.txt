does anyone love their music?

i saw that this band's pictures were never posted here.

frankly, i didn't even know how they looked like until i searched for their pics.

from wiki:

Sodagreen is a Taiwanese pop rock band. It first made public in 2004 when it received the Grand Jury Award in Hohaiyan Gongliau Rock Festival. In 2006, it received the 17th Golden Music Award nomination for Best Arranger and Best Band. Sodagreen is renowned for its vocalist, Ching-Fong's unique voice with a wide voice range.

some random from google.com

post more pictures, if you have them. ;D

They're really talented! I have to admit that the lead singer's voice bugs me after awhile but that's ok. I love Pin Lu

How many GMAs were they nominated for? Like, seven?
