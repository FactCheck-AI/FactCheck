Murder, My Sweet is a 1944 Edward Dmytryk-directed Film Noir. It was adapted from the 1940 Raymond Chandler novel, Farewell, My Lovely.

Moose Malloy has just gotten out of jail, and hires detective Philip Marlowe to track the Love Interest he lost touch with while serving time. He is also hired by a beautiful woman named Clare Trevor to find a stolen jade necklace. It becomes more obvious that their stories are connected as the film continues.

Tropes used in Murder, My Sweet include:

Deadpan Snarker: Powell does a great job (arguably even better than Bogart) in capturing how snarky Marlowe is.

Does Not Like Men: Anne.

Doesn't Like Guns: "That's just part of my clothes. I hardly ever shoot anybody with it."

Femme Fatale: Helen Grayle/Velma Valento

Fiery Redhead: Helen Grayle/Velma Valento

Film Noir
