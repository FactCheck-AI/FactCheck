MURDER, MY SWEET

Plus The Three Stooges in Healthy, Wealthy and Dumb

(1944, Edward Dmytryk) “I caught the blackjack right behind my ear. A black pool opened at my feet. I dived in.” Dick Powell’s Philip Marlowe, sweating through a police grilling, flashes back to tell this story of murder, blackmail, sadism, sexual servitude, and bicep-ogling Claire Trevor. Based on Raymond Chandler’s Farewell, My Lovely. Approx. 95 min. 35mm.

12:40, 5:10, 9:50

“The purest version of Chandler on film.”
