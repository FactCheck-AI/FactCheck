The Serbian actor Lazar Ristovski and his 39 years younger partner Anica Lazic they packed their bags and traveled to the sea from where they regularly announce themselves.

Namely, after Lazar Ristovski published a video of him getting out of the pool, Anica now also published photos in a bathing suit.

She posed on the hot sand in a white bikini, and Ristovsky really went out of his way to photograph her the way she wanted.

By the way, after they announced that they were together, what caused the most comments was the age difference, and Anica Lazić is 39 years younger than Lazar Ristovski.

Despite that, Anica often points out on social networks that many things fascinate her about Lazar.

– Lazarus (meaning: "God helps"). It is believed that a man with this name was sent by God to help the Earth. I know that it is so - she wrote recently on social networks, then addressed Ristovski directly:

– You are the winner. Benefactor. Our greatest artist. The eternal creator who loves life and therefore life loves you. Protector. An optimist. The patriot. Bold and brave. A great friend. A man with a wide awareness and a good heart - added Anica.

Lazar Ristovski's girlfriend spoke for the first time about the relationship with the actor: We both love action and a fast pace
