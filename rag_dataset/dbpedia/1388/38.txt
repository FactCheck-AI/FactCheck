Born in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, Raul Garcia, was able to escape Castro’s communist regime with his mother at the age of 11. They immigrated to Madrid, Spain, where the Catholic Church helped the two refugees obtain political asylum into the United States. The two settled in Miami, Florida where most of their family continues to reside.

Raul graduated from the University of Miami, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Microbiology/Immunology. He then went on to graduate from medical school at the New York College of Osteopathic Medicine. He developed a passion for Emergency Medicine and has continued to serve the front lines for the last 25 years.

In addition to Emergency Medicine, he has been a successful small business owner of his own medical practice, has been the founding Dean of two medical schools, and the Medical Director of two hospitals. He is currently the Chief Medical Officer of Astria Toppenish Hospital.

His experience as an immigrant who fought hard for the American Dream, has given him a great appreciation for public service. He deeply understands that Washington needs fresh leadership to revitalize our state.

He founded ‘Opportunity for Washington’ as a non-profit, nonpartisan effort promoting education and change. He also founded the Partnership for Food Security in 2020 to promote education for COVID-19, particularly among the Latino community. He is dedicated to educating the state’s people and encouraging a more positive outlook for the future of our state and our resilient country.

Raul is a very proud and committed father to his five children. He and his wonderful wife Jessica live in Yakima.
