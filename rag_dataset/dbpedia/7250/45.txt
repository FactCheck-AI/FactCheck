It’s no surprise that Prince was a fan of Jane Child. After a bidding war between 14 labels in which she demanded complete creative control, this Toronto-based artist wrote, produced, and performed every note of her debut album. Her funky pop single “Don’t Wanna Fall In Love” skyrocketed to #2 on the Billboard Charts in 1990, opening the door of endless possibility for this Canadian badass with an unforgettable look. So why are we discussing her on One Hit Thunder? We asked ourselves the same thing. Stay tuned to find out.
