Communications Intelligence Analysis Training

SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) is intelligence derived from electronic signals and systems used by foreign targets.

These targets include everything from communications systems to radars and weapons systems. SIGINT provides a vital window for the U.S. military into foreign adversaries’ capabilities, actions and intentions.

The origins of SIGINT can be traced back to the first world war when British forces began intercepting German radio communications to gain intelligence about their plans. This led to the use of cryptography to conceal the content of radio transmissions, and as such, cryptanalysis became an integral part of SIGINT as well.

The world has changed and so has advances in communications intelligence. Today, the U.S. military gathers signals intelligence through several means, including:

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) like the Global Hawk and Reaper drones

Interception of electronic communications data

U.S. military drones are now equipped with powerful infrared sensors and cameras, as well as Light and Imaging Detection (LIDAR) and synthetic aperture RADAR systems to gather and transmit back valuable raw intelligence from the operational environment for analysis.

Agents of the National Security Agency (NSA) use the capture of electronic communications to provide actionable intelligence in real time by bringing in data like emails, texts, phone calls and more.

The raw SIGINT is then translated, interpreted or represented into information which can then be analyzed and used for decision-making.

SIGINT is divided into three sub-disciplines:

Communications Intelligence (COMINT)which is the interception of communication between people and groups

Electronic Intelligence (ELINT)which is the intercepting of electronic signals which are not specifically used for communication

Foreign Instrumentation Signals Intelligence (FISINT)which is the collection of signals created by the testing and use of foreign weapons systems.

There is some overlap between SIGINT and electronic warfare (EW) because the systems and equipment used for EW can simultaneously collect intelligence.

While EW is more focused on immediate threats in the operational environment, much of the data obtained can be used to enhance raw signals intelligence and SIGINT decision-making.

EW can detect the source of an electromagnetic signal, the type of equipment generating that signal, and relevant data like frequency, modulation.

Suggested Duration

1 Week, 2 Weeks or 4 Weeks Bootcamps; It will be customized based on goals and objectives of each participant.

Communications Intelligence Analysis involves collecting intelligence from communications and information systems to help protect troops and military operations, national security, fight terrorism, combat international crime and narcotics, support diplomatic negotiations, support allies, and advance many other important national objectives.

Participants will learn about COMINT/SIGINT and tools to collect and analyze signals from various sources, including foreign communications, satellite/space, commercial communication systems, mobile networks, radar and other electronic and communication systems. The instructors will show you what to collect, and how to process, analyze, produce, and disseminate Signals Intelligence information and data for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.

Participants will also learn about advanced techniques and algorithms for collection, network characterization, and analysis across the Radio Frequency Spectrum for the purpose of supporting Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze and Disseminate (F3EAD).

Communication is an important part of everyday life — especially when it comes to leading a country. World leaders communicate with their people in a variety of ways. All of these forms of communication emit a signal that can be collected. The information gathered from these intercepted signals is of vital importance to national security.

About Communications Intelligence, Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and Analysis

SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) is a broad discipline and can include intelligence collection from various means including communications intelligence (COMMINT), electronic intelligence (ELINT), Radar and electronic warfare (EW).

SIGINT systems gather information from adversaries’ electronic signals. Analysts then evaluate this raw data from foreign communication systems, radars and weapon systems, and transform it into actionable intelligence. The information generated by these systems offers insight into adversaries’ actions, capabilities, and intentions before they are carried out.

As electronic warfare and wireless technology has evolved, so have approaches to signals intelligence. Automation and artificial intelligence (AI), for example, have greatly improved communications planning and intelligence capabilities. An automated algorithm detects and identifies signals in sensor data much faster than a highly trained operator.

Signal detection from massive amounts of stored data is like searching for a needle in a haystack. An operator controlled autonomous agent finds incoming signals, automatically determine signal type, and provides an analyst with reasons why a determination was made.

Algorithms help SIGNET systems automates the low-level detection and classification tasks. This frees up military personnel to focus on higher level tactical decision making. This way, the system becomes another team member, with a supervising human in the loop to authorize the appropriate military response.

In addition, through SIGNET automation, a commander can gain an “EM signature picture” of his forces as they are arrayed in the battlespace. This way, he can glean valuable information on his own EM signature and use that information to improve or implement additional passive and active actions to increase survivability.

The responsibilities of a signals intelligence (SIGINT) analyst include examining foreign communications and activity and collating the information by compiling reports on combat, strategy and tactical intelligence, to support Special Operations Task Force and other government agencies.

Using advanced equipment, the SIGINT analyst analyzes intercepted messages and organizes relevant information, identifies operational patterns, and notifies commanders of unusual activity so they can respond appropriately. Other duties include maintaining databases and assisting with placing, camouflaging and retrieving surveillance systems.

Opportunities in this type of position are most prevalent in the military including the Army, Air Force and the National Guard, but there are positions available outside the military as well, such as with technology companies that work with law enforcement and counterintelligence agencies.
