Nathaniel Lee Phelps 42, of Cleveland, MS passed away on February 11, 2024, at his residence.

A visitation honoring Nathan will be held on Thursday, February 15, 2024, from 2 pm to 3 pm at Ray Funeral Home—no services to follow.

Born the mightiest of two of the tiniest twins in the Baton Rouge Woman’s Hospital on November 5, 1981, Nathan would graduate from St. Amant High School in Gonzales, LA. Finding his way in life, he had two beautiful daughters, Chloe, and Savannah.

Nathan was a person who loved working with his hands so it was no surprise that he would follow in his big brother Jack’s footsteps and become a welder.

Nathan was often called “Twin” or lovingly “Boy”. He will be so very missed.

Those left to mourn him are his daughters, Chloe Simon, and Savannah Phelps, his father Jerry Phelps, twin brother Daniel Phelps (Lisa), his brother Jack Phelps (Christine), sisters Menee Harthcock (Jim), and Linsey Phelps, special friend Cynthia Couey, nieces Addison Moore, Sara Dixon Harthcock, Lillie Wynn, nephews Ashton Ballard, Cole Harthcock and Haydon Moore and great niece Arianna Joy Hall.

Nathan is predeceased by his mother Anita Joy Davidson, stepdad Ben Davidson, grandparents Yvonne Phelps, and Jack Ward, and his aunt Verena Tootsie Phelps.
