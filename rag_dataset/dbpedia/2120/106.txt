In the exposition five different positions in contemporary drawing are presented. Marcel van Eeden and Elmar Trenkwalder are regular artists of the gallery, Tobias Gerber, Leo Kogan en Dick Tuinder are invited to participate in the show.

Marcel van Eeden (1965) has worked on an impressive collection of drawings for years, using pictures and photographs dating from before his birth in 1965. These past years he introduced an element of fiction in his drawings by having a fictional character undergo adventures on the basis of existing visual material. In the present exhibition a series of portraits is shown of people whose names end in ‘-Witz’. The drawings are arranged on a dark-painted wall in the way of an installation, just as he recently did in the Kunstverein Heidelberg.
