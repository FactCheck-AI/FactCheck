25 Years of So So Def hits and remixes is what you'll find on this limited edition picture disc.

The visionary producer/musician/entrepreneur Jermaine Dupri launched So So Def Recordings in 1993, following the success of Kris Kross's hit song "Jump," which was written and produced by Dupri and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2018. So So Def brought together strains of Southern hip-hop, R&B, soul, and new club sounds to create an ongoing catalog of music that continues to transform the culture. So So Def's first act, the female R&B vocal quartet Xscape struck platinum with three albums in a row beginning with their 1993 debut Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha continuing through Off the Hook (1995) and Traces of My Lipstick (1998). A creative wellspring for some of contemporary hip-hop's most innovative artists, So So Def released Da Brat's historic 1994 debut Funkdafied, the first album by a female solo rapper to achieve platinum status, and, in 1997, introduced the R&B hitmakers Jagged Edge to the world with the group's debut album, A Jagged Era. In 2000, So So Def released Beware of Dog, the debut album from (then) 13-year-old hip-hop prodigy Lil Bow Wow. Supported by four smash singles--"Bounce with Me" featuring Xscape, "Bow Wow (That's My Name)" featuring Snoop Dogg, "Puppy Love" featuring Jagged Edge, and "Ghetto Girls"--Beware of Dog went triple platinum, propelling Bow Wow into the hip-hop stratosphere.
