All but one of the 40 MHAs elected in November have taken their oath of office, and some are being assigned new roles.

The swearing in ceremony was held at the Newfoundland and Labrador legislature Friday morning.

The only MHA who couldn't make it was the leader of the Progressive Conservative opposition, Paul Davis.

He was listed as "unavoidably absent," and believed to be taking the vacation he promised his wife, Cheryl, after the November 30th election.

New Democratic Party Leader Earle McCurdy, who did not win a seat, watched from the visitor's gallery.

In their oath of office for the 48th General Assembly, MHAs swore they are eligible to hold office, didn't break election rules and won't let financial benefit influence their decision making.

The PCs have named Ferryland MHA Keith Hutchings as the opposition house leader. Tracey Perry, who represents Fortune Bay-Cape La Hune, will be caucus whip and the MHA for Conception Bay East-Bell Island, David Brazil, will chair the public accounts committee.
