History

Time Warner was founded in 1985 as a merger between Time Inc. and Warner Communications. The company initially focused on producing magazines, books, and television programming. In the following years, it acquired several other media companies, including HBO, CNN, and Turner Broadcasting System. During the late 20th century, Time Warner became one of the largest media conglomerates in the world, with interests in film production, music publishing, and cable television. However, the company faced challenges in the early 21st century due to changing consumer habits and competition from digital platforms. It spun off its publishing division in 2014 and sold its interest in Hulu in 2017. Today, Time Warner is primarily known for its ownership of Warner Bros., which produces films, television shows, and video games.
