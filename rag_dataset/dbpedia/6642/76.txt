Figures have been rounded.

The 2013 financial information has been recast so the basis of presentation is consistent with that of the 2014 financial information. On June 6, 2014, the Company completed the legal and structural separation of Time Inc. from the Company. Accordingly, the Company has recast its financial information to present the financial condition and results of operations of its former Time Inc. segment as discontinued operations.

Time Warner merged with AT&T on June 14, 2018, thereby changing its name from Time Warner Inc. to Warner Media. The 2018 and 2019 AT&T Annual reports did not include results from Time Warner operations prior to the acquisition.
