The traffic on Danube Bridge between the Bulgarian city of Ruse and the Romanian town of Giurgiu will be hampered due to repair works starting on the Romanian side.

The Romanian National Company of Motorways and National Roads informed the Bulgarian Road Infrastructure Agency of the forthcoming repair works on the DN5 road.

The road spanning the section from the exit of the customs office on Romanian territory to the beginning of the bridge will be also repaired.

A single lane will be used for traffic in both directions of the bridge until the end of the year with a speed limit of 10 km/h introduced.
