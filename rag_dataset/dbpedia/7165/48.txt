The Martin Beck books are widely acknowledged as some of the most influential detective novels ever written. Written by Swedish husband and wife team Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö between 1965-1975, the ten-book series set a gold standard for all subsequent Scandanavian crime fiction. Long before Kurt Wallander or Harry Hole, Beck was the original flawed policeman, working with a motley collection of colleagues to uncover the cruelty and injustice lurking beneath the surface of Sweden's seemingly liberal, democratic society.

This complete collection includes:

Roseanna (1965) - translated by Lois Roth and dramatised by Jennifer Howarth

The Man Who Went Up in Smoke (1966) - translated by Joan Tate and dramatised by Katie Hims

The Man on the Balcony (1967) - translated by Alan Blair and dramatised by Katie Hims
