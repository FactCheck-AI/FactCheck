10 Things I Hate About You July 6th, 1999 review details

I really enjoyed this, but not quite as much as the Taming of the Shrew play that I saw in Melbourne many years ago.

28 Days June 10th, 2000 imdb

Not too heavy, not too light.

3 Strikes March 3rd, 2000 details trailers

Very silly, but fun. A sad reflection on the LAPD. There are some BIG guys in this movie. I mean HUGE!

8mm April 20th, 1999 review details

Disturbing and captivating. Hard to judge the movie because the material alone is gripping enough. The "dance with the devil and the devil will change you" theme was fairly clumsy.

Almost Famous February 12th, 2001 July 11th, 2001 imdb

You probably shouldn't listen to anything I have to say about this movie as I'm still convinced that Penny Lane is Billy's sister.

Along Came a Spider April 8th, 2001 imdb

Morgan Freeman chasing a murderer always makes for an interesting movie.

America's Sweethearts September 17th, 2001 November 9th, 2001 imdb

John Cussack and Billy Crystal are great as always...

American Beauty September 26th, 1999 April 3rd, 2000 details trailers

Unexpected, unusual and very well done.

American History X June 8th, 1999 review details

I see a lot of movies and I enjoy most of them. Every now and then though I see a movie which makes the rest just seem like crap. American History X is one of those movies.

American Pie August 27th, 1999 October 30th, 1999 March 27th, 2000 review details trailers

A good quality teen flick that had me laughing the whole time. The American audience didn't quite seem to find it as funny as I did though (Boston). I enjoyed it just as much the second time (Sydney). And the 3rd (Berne, Switzerland).

Anaconda October 6, 1997 review details

I saw this movie at approximately 4am and quite enjoyed it. I'm not sure how it would fair if I was in a more awake state.

Antz November 6, 1998 review details

I enjoyed this film until I saw A Bug's Life. Antz just lacked the Disney touch.

As Good As It Gets February 21, 1998 review details

Good entertainment. Jack Nicholson is just brilliant.

Analyse This March 23, 1999 review details

Very funny. Robert De Niro is always good, and the combination with Billy Crystal in this movie is interesting.

Austin Powers 2 June 29th, 1999 review details

Much funnier than the first one because it didn't try to push every joke quite as far or as long.

Bean July 4, 1997 review details

If you have watched and loved the show then don't see the movie. It is just recycled humour from the television series. The only interesting part is the way we are shown that Mr Bean actually realizes how annoying he is.

Bedazzled January 30th, 2001 imdb

Simple, predictable but not terrible.

Beethovens 3rd August 7th, 2000 imdb

I'll watch anything on a 14 hour flight, not sure I would have got through this otherwise.

Being John Malkovich January 2nd, 2000 review details trailers

Very clever. Does a great job of making a completely unbelievable story line seem possible.

Big Daddy October 15th, 1999 review details trailers

Not up to par with other Adam Sandler films.

The Big Hit July 7, 1998 review details

A very pleasant surprise. I knew nothing before I went in, after I came out I was recommending it to everyone.

The Big Lebowski April 25, 1998 review details

This was really funny. I never realized how perfectly John Goodman would fit a violent militant role.

Billy Elliot April 19th, 2001 imdb

Charming.

Blade October 13, 1998 review details

I knew nothing about this film when I went in. That made it twice as good as it would otherwise have been just from the surprise.

The Blair Witch Project August 27th, 1999 review details trailers

You must see this film, I saw it twice. Brilliant.

Blue Streak November 9th, 1999 review details trailers

Martin Lawrence just can't play Eddie Murphy parts as well as Eddie Murphy can.

The Bone Collector December 7th, 1999 review details trailers

Patchy. An interesting idea that could have been done a lot better.

Boogie Nights February 20, 1998 review details

I would never has guessed that I would enjoy this film. From the ads it seemed like sex, sex and more sex (not that there's anything wrong with that :-). I heard an interview with the director where he said that he wanted to explore with this movie the way porn is something that many people both enjoy and are disgusted by. Overall, the movie just left me feeling sad.

Bowfinger September 14th, 1999 review details trailers

Good fun, but not as good as you might expect from all these big name comedians.

Bring It On December 19th, 2000 imdb

Trashy, but fun. Strange that cheerleading never took off in Australia. How many dance related movies have we seen over the last few months!

Brokedown Palace August 26th, 1999 review details trailers

Interesting, but it felt tame since I've read a book by an Australian sent to a Thai prison.

A Bug's Life December 13, 1998 review details

Another clever and fun Disney film, they just always seem to create magical characters. The end credits is definitely the best part.

Can't Hardly Wait September 22, 1998 review details

I'll admit that I saw this just because of Jennifer Love Hewitt. I shouldn't have bothered.

Cast Away January 23rd, 2001 imdb

After the brilliant plane crash sequence, anyone could be afraid to fly.

The Castle July 23, 1997 review details

A hilarious movie about a simple Australian family. Somehow the strange and stupid family members manage to win your heart in their quest to protect their "castle". I just hope that overseas watchers realize that this is not a typical Australian family, although it's probably not far from the truth.

Celebrity June 12th, 1999 review details

Enjoyable film with a nice twist of fortunes for the characters. Don't be scared off by Leonardo, his role is very small.

Center Stage October 17th, 2000 imdb

If you enjoy watching dancing, you'll enjoy this movie. It scared me that I even enjoyed the ballet.

Charlie's Angels December 5th, 2000 imdb

mmmm... Cameron. Great action and lots of funny little references to other shows / films...

Chill Factor September 6th, 1999 details

Very predictable, but some nice action sequences.

Chocolat February 23rd, 2001 imdb

Simply delicious...

Chopper August 17th, 2000 imdb

Extra scary for all of us who have seen the real Chopper interviewed by Elle McFeast.

The Cider House Rules April 10th, 2000 review details trailers

Moving and gripping.

A Civil Action May 4th, 1999 review details

It felt a little bit long and slow, but that may just be because it is based on a true story. The statistics and insights into personal injury law were interesting.

A Clockwork Orange November 27th, 1999 review details trailers

The bashing we saw after the movie made the violence seem a lot more real.

Copland February 3, 1998 review details

This movie is great for laughing at Sylvester Stallone. He is just such an oaf!

Coyote Ugly January 13th, 2001 imdb

Coyote ugly and the girls in this movie is a bit of a contradiction.

The Craic May 11th, 1999 review details

I really enjoyed this film laughing out loud a number of times. It was great seeing Australia through the eyes of an Irishman. The barmaid will take your breath away...

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon January 16th, 2001 April 19th, 2001 imdb

I love the new slow-motion / beyond reality fighting effects, but think this movie took them a bit too far. I enjoyed this movie a lot more the second time.

Cruel Intentions April 14th, 1999 review details

Felt a bit stupid and slow at the start. By the end the characters become interesting.

The Cup June 2nd, 2000 imdb

All this and the final wasn't even a very good game...

Deep Impact June 23, 1998 review details

Some great special effects. I'm a little ashamed to admit that I got a bit choked up at the end.

Delivering Milo July 23rd, 2001 imdb

Strange and stupid.

The Devil's Advocate January 13, 1998 review details

An interesting movie. It had me engrossed the whole way.

The Dinner Game September 26th, 1999; January 16th, 2000 review details

Very, very funny and traumatic at the same time.

The Dish October 31st, 2000 imdb

Feels good and is a nice way for relatively young people like me to pretend to experience the moon landing.

Doctor Dolittle July 28, 1998 review details

Good fun.

Doctor Dolittle 2 July 17th, 2001 imdb

Cute and funny but quickly forgotten.

Dog Park September 24th, 1999 details

A cute little romantic comedy.

Dolphins April 25th, 2000 details

It went through the IMAX motions but there was very little really effective footage.

Double Jeopardy September 25th, 1999 details trailers

Interesting concept but if you've seen the trailer you've basically seen the film.

Down to Earth July 23rd, 2001 imdb

Pretty much a waste of time.

East is East June 20th, 2000 imdb

Don't let the trailer suck you into thinking that this is a comedy.

Edtv June 1st, 1999 review details

Great movie. Leaves the Truman Show for dead.

Election October 19th, 1999 review details trailers

Wonderful characters.

End of Days January 13th, 2000 review details trailers

Satan was the only good thing in this movie.

Enemy of the State January 12, 1999 review details

Really enjoyable. Will Smith and Gene Hackman work well together.

Entrapment July 20th, 1999 review details

Sean Connery and Catherine Zeta-Jones, something for everyone! Lots of unexpected twists.

Erin Brockovich April 7th, 2000 review details trailers

Great movie. Julia Roberts is fantastic.

Everest July 21, 1998 review details

The only good IMAX film I have ever seen. Looking over the edge of the precipice on that screen was just breathtaking.

Evolution November 3rd, 2001 imdb

On a plane, anything is watchable.

Extreme April 10th, 1999 review details

This movie confirmed my thinking that the great IMAX format is not enough to make a movie good. The focus on extreme sports sounds perfect but many of the shots were so panoramic that you lost perspective on the size of the waves and the slope of the mountains. Some of the scenes were truly spectacular, just not enough of them.

Eyes Wide Shut August 12th, 1999 review details trailers

Very interesting movie. Not as weird as I thought it might be. Nicole is very beautiful, especially with curly hair and glasses.

Face/Off September 13, 1997 review details

Fantastic. John Travolta and Nick Cage do an amazing job of acting as each other. Nicholas Cage is just perfect for this bad guy role. The prison on the oil rig was also a highlight.

Fantasia 2000 April 12th, 2000 details trailers

Saw this in Japanese which made the visual interpretation of the music all the more impressive. I don't think it has the lasting imagery and characters of the original however.

The Fifth Element October 6, 1997 review details

Quite enjoyable and interesting.

Fight Club November 23rd, 1999 review details trailers

Unexpectedly clever...

Final Destination March 22nd, 2000 details trailers

Jumpy but silly.

Finding Forester April 10th, 2001 imdb

Warm and interesting. Also a good escape from 90 school kids cramped into economy on a red eye flight.

Forces of Nature May 25th, 1999 review details

Funny and I liked the ending. Sandra Bullock looks particularly cute in those tracksuit pants...

Funny Games August 9, 1998 review details

The best movie I have ever seen. My friend and I did not speak for 5 minutes after leaving the cinema. You must see this movie.

Galapogas 3D March 29th, 2000 review details

Another great IMAX experience.

Galaxy Quest May 2nd, 2000 review details trailers

Silly by funny. The aliens were brilliant.

The Generals Daughter November 16th, 1999 review details trailers

Interesting, but the casting gave away parts of the story.

Gladiator May 23rd, 2000 imdb

Filmed in a way that makes you think there is great depth to the characters and story. Unfortunately, there isn't. Russel Crowe is still fantastic.

Go August 11th, 1999 details trailers

I enjoyed the second and third storylines much more than the first. Saw this at a private screening in the city that my friend Joe won.

Gods and Monsters July 13th, 1999 review details

Although sick, I showed true dedication (read stupidity) and went to the movies. Unfortunately for the first time ever I keep falling asleep in the cinema. I did enjoy the bits I saw though.

Gone in Sixty Seconds July 4th, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb

Fast.

Good Will Hunting April 3, 1998 review details

I really liked this movie the first time I saw it. The second time though it felt a bit silly. The effect that Matt Daemon's character had on people seemed unrealistic.

Gossip October 3rd, 2000 imdb

The first movie that has left us thinking and prompted conversation for a long time.

Great Expectations March 28, 1998 review details

Enjoyable story. More enjoyable though was watching Gyneth in this film.

Hannibal March 6th, 2001 imdb

I was more chilled by the air conditioning in the cinema than by the movie itself.

Happy, Texas January 8th, 2000 review details trailers

Absolutely hilarious. A brilliant script.

High Fidelity September 26th, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb

Sucked on a plane, great in a cinema.

Himalaya May 16th, 2001 imdb

Movies like this are so easy to believe because they are so far removed from my sense of reality.

Hollow Man August 13th, 2000 imdb

Good special effects, but I just hate this type of movie.

The Hurricane April 16th, 2000 review details trailers

Great story. If only all the Canadians I know were that nice - NOT.

I Know What You Did Last Summer December 16, 1997 review details

I lump this in with Scream, etc. Not a type of movie that I enjoy.

An Ideal Husband August 16th, 1999 details trailers

An interesting look at human moral values, ethics and the way we judge others. (Airplane movie)

The Insider January 25th, 2000 review details trailers

I just couldn't get past Russell Crowe looking so old. Amazing story and Al Pacino is great.

Jackie Brown March 7, 1998 review details

I enjoyed the pace of this film. My friends found it too slow but I thought that the pace helped convey the mood of the film and the situations.

Jane Austen's Mafia August 6, 1998 review details

Very corny. I was in the mood so some parts were hilarious.

Joan of Arc February 7th, 2000 review details trailers

A great film that twists your mind to two perspectives on the story, leaving you wondering which one is correct.

Judas Kiss February 2nd, 2001 imdb

Exciting, interesting, intelligent and unpredictable. Everything a movie should be. Of course, starting with a lesbian love scene helps capture the attention of at least half the audience. ;)

Keeping the Faith June 27th, 2000 imdb

A unique and interesting story, which is quite rare these days...

The Kid November 25th, 2000 imdb

Started OK but just got weirder and weirder as it went on.

The Klumps December 28th, 2000 imdb

All the good bits are in the trailer. The characters had potential from the first movie, but not enough substance to justify their own.

KM 0 May 6th, 2001 imdb

A classic and interesting tale of lifes little co-incidences.

A Knights Tale September 22nd, 2001 imdb

Fantastic. Had me flinching the whole time. I wasn't expecting much, but really enjoyed it.

Kundun August 25, 1998 review details

Informative, moving and inspirational. A must see.

L.A. Confidential December 9, 1997 review details

I loved this film. I recommend it to everyone. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were brilliant. I am still outraged that Kim Bassinger won an Oscar for this film while the Australian boys didn't even get nominated.

Lethal Weapon 4 September 15, 1998 review details

They should have stopped at 3. Not bad, but not legendary like the others. Why is Riggs suddenly too old as well?

Life is Beautiful March 30, 1999 review details

I had to see this because my Dad kept pestering me and Roberto Benigni was just so infectious at the Oscars. Humour and a concentration camp is an unlikely mix but Roberto's infectiousness makes it work very well. Funny and sad.

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels November 24, 1998 review details

Very enjoyable. Especially the payback on the parking officer.

Looking for Alibrandi May 16th, 2000 August 14th, 2000 imdb

Great! Pia Miranda is just adorable...

Loser August 29th, 2000 imdb

Nice. The cast was good, but very much in their trademark roles.

Lost & Found August 16th, 1999 details trailers

Some chuckly bits but on the whole it wasn't quite there... (Airplane movie)

Mad About Mambo November 29th, 2000 imdb

There are a lot of dance oriented movies around at the moment. This one, like the others, was quite pleasant to watch.

The Matrix April 15th, 1999 review details

A fantastic sci-fi film. Amazing special effects, a clever story, computers, filmed in Australia - what more could you want? Just one thing, to be able to move that fast...

Meet the Parents January 2nd, 2001 imdb

Hilarious. Ben Stiller rocks.

Memento May 27th, 2001 imdb

Interesting format, but be more awake than I was when you choose to see it.

Men in Black October 6, 1997 review details

Funny. The contrast between Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones makes most of the humour possible. My favourite part is still the television advertisement that I didn't understand until seeing the movie. They hold up the memory eraser, it flashes, and the quote "See it again, for the first time".

The Mexican May 1st, 2001 July 23rd, 2001 imdb

Enjoyable little tale ... particularly for those who like drooling over Brad Pitt.

Micky Blue Eyes August 30th, 1999 details trailers

Simple fun with lots of Hugh Grant sorry's.

Miss Congeniality March 25th, 2001 imdb

Funnier and not quite as silly as I was expecting.

Mission: Impossible II June 6th, 2000 imdb

Like all good action films, completely unbelievable.

Moulin Rouge June 13th, 2001 imdb

I hate to admit that musicals are growing on me...

My Best Friends Wedding September 27, 1997 review details

Extremely light. It basically felt like the whole movie was based around one catchy tune (Say a Little Prayer For Me). The hilarious gay friend of Julia Roberts was the one thing that made the movie worth watching.

Mulan September 27, 1998 review details

Arguably my favourite Disney film. I loved it.

Mumford February 13th, 2000 details trailers

Simple, funny. Perhaps I was too dulled by the 13 hour plane trip to enjoy it more.

Music of the Heart February 13th, 2000 details trailers

Nice story, nice movie. Meryl Streep is great.

Mystery, Alaska February 13th, 2000 details trailers

Good small town feel and one of the few unpredictable sports movies ever made.

The Negotiator October 27, 1998 review details

I love Samuel L Jackson films and this was no exception.

Notting Hill June 15th, 1999 review details

Nice movie. I was a little disappointed though since I was hoping for another brilliant movie like Four Weddings.

O Brother, Where Art Thou? January 21st, 2001 imdb

Not sure where it went, but I enjoyed the ride.

The Opposite of Sex August 18, 1998 review details

This movie just annoyed me.

The Out of Towners October 11th, 1999 review details trailers

Silly, as expected.

Patch Adams April 3rd, 1999 review details

Very funny but perhaps a little too sentimental for those who aren't immune to Hollywood movies like I am.

The Patriot July 25th, 2000 imdb

I even got a bit watery eyed at one point.

Payback March 16. 1999 review details

Interesting watching Mel Gibson as a bad guy. Quite enjoyable, but I think that may be largely due to it starring Mel.

The Peacemaker December 18, 1997 review details

I think that this was the George Clooney and Nicole Kidman movie. Obviously it left a strong impression on me.

The Perfect Storm July 9th, 2000 imdb

Great storm scenes wrapped in a bad attempt at building land-based relationships for the main characters.

The Phantom Menace June 3rd, 1999 review details

I'd been looking forward to it for ages, and I wasn't disappointed. I just wish that I could be watching the whole 6 film series in order.

Picture Perfect November 1, 1997 review details

My ex dragged me to see this movie. I should have fought harder to get away.

Planet of the Apes November 3rd, 2001 imdb

Interesting concept (still), great special effects.

The Prince of Egypt December 25, 1998 review details

The story was simply just too serious. Some of the animation was great though.

The Princess Diaries September 15th, 2001 imdb

Lots of smiles from all the "would be princesses" in the audience.

Proof of Life April 2nd, 2001 imdb

Watchable, but no where near as good as Ransom.

Quills March 4th, 2001 imdb

Disturbing content is by its nature compelling. Unfortunately this film doesn't seem to have a more interesting message hidden below.

The Red Violin November 2nd, 1999 review details

I really enjoyed it but somehow the 2 hours still felt long.

Reindeer Games October 10th, 2000 imdb

It took half an hour to remember that we'd seen it. I was even looking at the title and thinking that we never got around to it.

Remember the Titans January 31st, 2001 imdb

Things are still not perfect, but it's so hard to imagine living in a time when racism was such a dividing issue. It's also strange to have a feel good movie where people spend most of their time getting pummelled.

Road Trip September 22nd, 2000 imdb

Slow start, funny middle, poor ending.

Romeo Must Die March 22nd, 2000 May 30th, 2000 imdb

Really good action film. Used some visual effects brilliantly to further highlight the violence.

Rounders March 2, 1999 review details

I enjoyed the card playing in this movie. The character Worm infuriated me so much that I almost wasn't enjoying the movie. It must have been good.

Run Lola Run October 26th, 1999 review details trailers

Breathtaking.

Runaway Bride August 19th, 1999 review details trailers

Nice to see Julia Roberts and Richard Gere together again.

Rush Hour February 9, 1999 review details

Not bad, but it is just so disappointing when compared to the brilliant action in Chinese Jackie Chan films.

Save the Last Dance May 2nd, 2001 imdb

Inter-racial dating is something we don't see enough of in the media today...

Saving Private Ryan December 18, 1998 review details

One of those films where no one in the cinema makes a single noise. Maybe that's because the sound effects were up to 110dB :-). So realistic. Thought provoking. It made me realize the contradictions of war. The overall cause is worthy, the campaigns are costly and futile, but one person can make a huge difference.

Scary Movie September 5th, 2000 imdb

If 30% of one million jokes work you have a funny movie.

Scream 2 February 10, 1998 review details

Good suspense like the first one. Just too much gore for me though.

Shaft November 7th, 2000 imdb

The most violent movie I've seen in quite a while. Funny though...

Shakespeare in Love March 1, 1999 review details

An extremely clever movie. Shakespeare within Shakespeare. Highly recommended. I saw it twice.

Shanghai Noon August 22nd, 2000 October 26th, 2000 imdb

Finally a mainstream Jackie Chan movie that gets the mix exactly right.

Shooting Fish September 8, 1998 review details

Harmless. Quite funny.

Shrek June 29th, 2001 August 3rd, 2001 imdb

Fantastic fun... "that'll do Donkey, that'll do"

A Simple Plan February 23, 1999 review details

Another spiral movie, where one bad decision leads to endless problems. Not bad though.

The Sixth Sense August 27th, 1999 review details trailers

Bruce Willis couldn't quite pull off this non tough guy role. A very clever story.

Sleepy Hollow January 1st, 2000 review details trailers

Even worse than I was expecting.

Sliding Doors August 10, 1998 review details

Interesting concept.

Snatch November 14th, 2000 imdb

Great story that was very well filmed...

Snow Falling on Cedars January 11th, 2000 review details trailers

Conveys a lot of feeling and emotion with visual imagery and sound effects. The subtle portrayal of rasism is very well done.

Someone Like You August 3rd, 2001 imdb

It was alright until the terrible ending.

South Park : Bigger, Longer and Uncut July 29th, 1999 review details

Very, very funny. I particularly liked the music. I'm glad I watched a few episodes on video before seeing the movie though...

The Suburbans February 13th, 2000 details

Very silly but funny. Jennifer Love Hewitt makes it much more watchable.

Superstar September 28th, 2000 imdb

Simple but enjoyable.

The Sweet Hereafter August 11, 1998 review details

I cannot remember a single thing about this movie.

Swordfish July 9th, 2001 imdb

I laughed when I watched the guy while hacking. Banging his head on the desk, having revelations, etc. Exactly the things I do when coding...

The Talented Mr Ripley April 10th, 2000 review details trailers

Ultimately not that interesting.

Tarzan April 10th, 2000 review details trailers

Good, but not as special as some Disney classics.

Tea with Mussolini October 15th, 1999 review details trailers

An interesting perspective on WWII but pretty slow.

There's Something About Mary September 11, 1998 review details

Pushes the line of what I feel comfortable laughing at. I laughed very hard in the cinema, I felt a little uncomfortable afterwards. On reflection the laughter is outweighing the discomfort.

The Thin Red Line March 13, 1999 review details

I was very disappointed. This movie got rave reviews everywhere and I hated it. I thought that it was long and boring. There was very little action and lots of voice overs. I hate voice overs. Some of the sound effects and cinematography was fantastic though.

The Thomas Crown Affair August 19th, 1999 review details trailers

A very enjoyable power struggle. I love Rene Russo all the more after this film.

Thrill Ride: The Science of Fun September 3, 1997 review details

This IMAX format movie was a real disappointment. Most of the movie is made in the standard cinema screen format. There was probably about 15 minutes of excitement in the 1 hour movie. The title should have been warning enough.

Titanic July 14, 1998 review details

Brilliant. The story was so powerful. One of those amazing movies where the special effects are so good that you don't even realize how good they are because you don't notice them at all. I am so glad that I saw it on the big screen. I wonder if movies will ever get more true to life than Titanic.

Tombraider July 13th, 2001 imdb

Just stay home and play the game.

Tomorrow Never Dies January 29, 1998 review details

I quite like Pierce Brosnan as Bond.

Topsy Turvey April 15th, 2000 review details trailers

If I wasn't so jet lagged I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. It is guaranteed to put you to sleep in that state however. There were some great scenes depicting life at that time.

Toy Story 2 December 26th, 1999 review details trailers

Some amazing graphics, I was really disappointed that they didn't show the out-takes during the trailers in my theatre.

Traffic March 20th, 2001 imdb

Interesting style, interesting story, difficult problems, great acting.

Tropfest 2001 February 25th, 2001 site

85,000 people decide to converge on the domain have a quiet picnic and watch short films together. Fantastic!

The Truman Show October 1, 1998 review details

Interesting concept. I just thought that Jim Carrey was unnecessary and that the ending was very weak.

True Crime May 13th, 1999 review details

Enjoyable suspense film. The death row prisoner and his family convey their emotion very convincingly. Clint Eastwood makes us feel awkward just watching him fumble through life as a reporter.

Twenty-Four Seven June 30, 1998 review details

I don't feel I can comment on this movie as I don't think that I really understood it.

Two Hands August 10th, 1999 review details

A strange mix of comedy and weirdness. Lots of subtle Australian jokes.

U-571 May 9th, 2000 imdb

Nothing builds suspense like a submarine movie.

Unbreakable January 4th, 2001 imdb

Strange but got more and more interesting as it went on.

Varsity Blues April 6th, 1999 review details

Teen trash. I enjoyed it though, mostly because of William Robert (Billy Bob).

Velvet Goldmine November 21, 1998 review details

Way too weird for me.

Vertical Limit April 19th, 2001 imdb

Definitely exciting and not as over the top as the previews seemed.

Very Bad Things February 16, 1999 review details

If you think that watching someone get chopped into little pieces is funny, then see this film.

The Very Thought of You May 18th, 1999 review details

This romantic comedy walks the fine line but doesn't become a chick flick. A lot of funny unpredictable events.

The Waterboy February 4, 1999 review details

Another hilarious Adam Sandler film. Almost as funny as Happy Gilmore.

The Wedding Singer May 22, 1998 review details
