The Great Gildersleeve Movie Collection on DVD

One of the very first spin-off sensations, Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve graduated from thorn in Fibber McGee's side ("You're a HARRRRD MAN, McGee!") to his own hit radio sitcom and a series of feature films starring Harold Peary as the befuddled blowhard. As an added treat, viewers can take a gander at the Great Gildersleeve's guest-starring gig alongside an all-star radio role call in the Lucille Ball/Victor Mature romantic romp Seven Days' Leave. 2-Disc, 5-Feature Collection.
