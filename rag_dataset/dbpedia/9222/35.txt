This week, on Inside the Skev, we sit down with Scott Rochelle, the President and CEO of the National Basketball Retired Players Association (NBRPA) which is headquartered in Downtown Chicago. In his role as President and CEO, Rochelle oversees the Retired Players Association’s day-to-day operations, including securing new cutting-edge partnerships for former players to thrive and prosper. In addition, he continues to strengthen and foster the association’s local chapters which has expanded to 12 cities during his tenure as President and CEO.

Founded in 1992 by NBA Legends Dave DeBusschere, Dave Bing, Archie Clark, Dave Cowens and Oscar Robertson, the NBRPA is a non-profit association comprised of former professional basketball players of the NBA, ABA, WNBA, and Harlem Globetrotters. They are the only alumni association of its kind supported directly by the NBA and National Basketball Players Association (NBPA). The National Basketball Retired Players Association serves former professional basketball players, supporting them in life after their playing days, and helping them to leverage their inspirational influence to promote and teach basketball in their communities.
