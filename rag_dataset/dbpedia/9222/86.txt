The U.S. Women’s National Team Players Association serves as a leading advocate for women’s soccer players, pioneering a new era of women’s soccer as a preeminent sport. Our primary mission is to protect the rights of USWNT players and to advance and safeguard the economic and social welfare of all USWNT players, both on and off the field. We are committed to raising the level of women’s soccer domestically and continuing to grow the game worldwide.

The Women’s National Team has always been a force to be reckoned with on and off the field of play. They have inspired and represented the nation with grit and grace, from their first major tournament win in 1991 to the trailblazing accomplishments of today.
