Learn more about the map styles

Each map type offers different information and each map style is designed for a different purpose. Read about the styles and map projection used in the above map (Political Location Map of Hwali).

Political map

Political map shows how people have divided up the world into countries and administrative regions such as states, counties, provinces, municipalities and postal zones. Different colors represent different countries and regions, whereas different shades of one color represent their internal divisions.

The choice of color is not related to the characteristics of Hwali, colors are assigned to countries and regions randomly. The capital is marked with a black star inside a white circle. Squares and circles of various size indicate other major cities.

Map projection of the location map

The location map of Hwali combines two projections: the orthographic azimuthal projection for the globe and the simple geographic projection for the rectangular part of the map. Geographic projection has straight meridians and parallels, each degree of latitude and longitude is the same size over the entire world map.

The orthographic azimuthal projection is a perspective projection from infinite distance. It was already known to the Egyptians and Greeks more than 2,000 years ago. It gives the appearance of the Earth viewed from outer space. Only one hemisphere can be viewed at a time. The globe centered on Hwali appears more realistic than almost any other projection.
