History of the XAF (Central African CFA Franc)

The XAF has its roots in France’s African colonial empire when France controlled much of West and Central Africa from the middle of the nineteenth century through the middle of the twentieth century. In 1910, the French government established French Equatorial Africa, a federation of French colonial possessions in Equatorial Africa, extending northwards from the Congo River into the Sahel.

The colonies of French Equatorial Africa used the French Equatorial franc as the official currency of the region and was in circulation from 1917 until 1945, when the Central African franc replaced it. As the countries in this region gained independence from France, they kept the Central African franc as their currency.

In 1964, the Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa evolved with the signing of the Treaty of Brazzaville. The signatory countries were Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, and Gabon. Equatorial Guinea, the only former Spanish colony in the monetary union, joined in 1983 and adopted the Central African CFA franc as its currency a year later.

In 1972, the Bank of Central African States was formed, replacing the Central Bank of Equatorial Africa and Cameroon as the currency manager and the region ’s banking supervisor.
