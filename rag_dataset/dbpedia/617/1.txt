Chris was an amazing chef who worked at several high-end restaurants within Central Indiana and the Chicago area. He was skilled and creative and enjoyed creating new and unique dishes.

As an avid athlete in his youth, Chris played baseball, basketball, and soccer. He especially excelled at soccer and had a passion for the sport. Chris enjoyed drawing and working with his hands. He could often be found hiking, camping, and spending time in the outdoors with nature.

Chris was always learning and exploring. He loved animals, especially his dog, Smooth and puppy, Trooper, whom he loved dearly. Chris enjoyed sitting and talking with his family over a game of cards or next to a hot bonfire. Chris was happiest when he was spending time with family because they were so important to him.
