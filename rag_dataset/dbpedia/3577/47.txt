Family

From https://minerdescent.com/2010/07/24/james-fitch/

James Fitch was for a period of almost twenty years one of the most powerful men in the colony. To his enemies he was “Black James” or the “Great land pirate,” but he led a faction devoted to charter government and native right that helped mark the transition from Puritan commonwealth to provincial Yankee society.

James first wife Elizabeth Mason was born in Aug 1654 in Saybrook, CT. She was the widow of William Adams of Dedham, Massachusetts. Her parents were Maj. John MASON and Anne PECK. The family relationship was unusual. When James married Elizabeth in 1675, Elizabeth’s older sister Priscilla had been James’ step-mother for over 10 years having married his father in 1664. Elizabeth died 8 Oct 1684 in Norwich, Conn.

James second wife Alice Bradford was born 27 Mar 1661 in Plymouth, Mass. Her parents were William Bradford and Alice Richards. William and Alice lived on the north side of Jones River in Stony Brook, Kingston, in the Plymouth Colony. William Bradford Plymouth Solider (Wiki) was Major Commander-in-chief of the Plymouth forces in the Great Swamp Fight in 1675 where he was severely wounded. He was active in politics. Alice died 10 Mar. 1745/46 Canterbury, Windham, CT
