“Poseidon” is a non-stop thrill as a small band of survivors climb through the inner workings of the ill-fated cruise ship trying to escape. During their journey, we are exposed to those who weren’t as fortunate and died; sometimes horrible deaths. However, while understanding that many perished, the director showed restraint and none were extremely graphic. Unfortunately, language again stops Dove from approving this adventure in the high seas.

We recommend you rent the original “Poseidon Adventure” which has been re-released on DVD.
