Santo Domingo is not just the capital of the Dominican Republic. In many respects, it's the capital city of the Caribbean as well. As well as being the region's most populous urban center, it was the first base of Spanish colonial rule in the Americas. In other words, Santo Domingo was the first European city this side of the Atlantic.

Santo Domingo's long history is evident all around when you learn Spanish here. The colonial center, characterized by cobblestone streets, holds historic churches, convents, homes, palaces and plazas. On the other hand, the city's modern side shines through in new buildings, hundreds of restaurants, bars and merengue clubs.
