Who are Free Will Baptists?

Free Will Baptists are members of a Christian denomination known as Free Will Baptist Churches. They adhere to Arminian theology, emphasizing human free will in salvation. This means they believe individuals can accept or reject God's offer of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

Like other Baptists, they practice believer's baptism by immersion and promote holy living and sanctification. Free Will Baptist congregations are autonomous, each governing itself independently. Evangelism and missions are central to their identity, actively spreading the Christian message.

Free Will Baptists have a distinctive theological stance within the Baptist tradition, placing a strong emphasis on individual choice in matters of faith and salvation.

Who are Southern Baptists?

Southern Baptists are members of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC), one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States. They are known for their conservative theology, emphasizing the inerrancy of the Bible and salvation through faith in Jesus Christ.

Like other Baptists, they practice believer's baptism by immersion and believe in the autonomy of individual churches. Southern Baptists place a strong focus on missions and evangelism, supporting both domestic and international missionary work.

They also maintain conservative social values on issues such as marriage and abortion. With millions of members and thousands of churches across the country, Southern Baptists have a significant presence in American evangelical Christianity and are actively involved in various community and outreach efforts.
