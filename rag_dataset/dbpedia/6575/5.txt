AMES, Iowa -- Induction into the Minnesota Vikings' Ring of Honor is the highest honor the NFL team can bestow upon an individual. The Vikings announced on Monday from 2012 Verizon Vikings Training Camp that former Iowa State All-American linebacker Matt Blair will receive that honor on Thursday, October 25 of this year.

Blair, a second-round pick of the Vikings out of Iowa State in 1974, played LB for the Vikings from 1974-85 and still ranks second in team history with 1,452 tackles; he collected 220 tackles in 1980, marking the third-most tackles by a player in team history. Only fellow Ring of Honor member Scott Studwell and Roy Winston played in more games at LB for the Vikings than Blair's 160 games (with 130 starts), and no other Vikings LB had more sacks (23.0) or INTs (16). Blair had a knack for being around the ball at the right time, as illustrated by the fact that he blocked 20 kicks during his career and had three games in which he blocked two kicks.

A six-time Pro Bowler and one-time All-Pro, Blair made his appearances in the all-star game in consecutive seasons (1977-82), and Alan Page (nine) is the only defensive player in club history with more Pro Bowls to his credit. Blair played on two Super Bowl teams with the Vikings, and the club won NFC Central Division titles and went to the playoffs in six of his first seven seasons in the League.

Blair made 121 tackles for the Iowa State's Sun Bowl team in 1971. He earned All-America honors for the Cyclones in 1973.

The Vikings Ring of Honor recognizes Vikings legends for their contributions to the success of the team on and off the field. Members of the Ring of Honor are recognized with a banner on the facade of Mall of America Field's upper deck, forever living in Vikings lore.
