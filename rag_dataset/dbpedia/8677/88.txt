"When I first really heard a Timbaland beat, I was like WTF is this? Is that a baby? It was the Aaliyah, “Are You That Somebody” song and ever since then, I knew dude was gonna be a problem. The Missy run was incredible. They were like Jordan and Pippen but then the songs he did with Jay-Z just solidified his skills as a producer. To working on whole albums with Justin Timberlake and making some of the biggest Pop and Hip-Hop records, Timbo is truly one of the best producers EVER! Hope y’all enjoyed."
