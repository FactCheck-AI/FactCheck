The Big Apple, the Windy City, the Golden State. They all have their charms, but a recent survey has revealed a surprise winner as the USA's best city: Norfolk.

According to Travel & Leisure, Virginia’s second-biggest city is better than Chicago, New York, New Orleans and San Francisco, coming top in three categories: America’s Favourite Hometown, America’s Top Best Places to Travel City and America’s Most Underrated City.

In reaction to the news, Donna Allen, vice president of sales and marketing for Visit Norfolk, said: “This is definitely a home run. It’s exciting. We’re thrilled.”

Norfolk - just over three hours south of Washington DC by car - topped the poll of readers of Travel & Leisure.

“When people who live or have lived in Norfolk were asked about their hometown, they raved about how welcoming this port city is to tourists – and what a great place it was to grab a burger, sip a pint of craft beer, and even admire creative street art,” says the write-up of the rankings.

And though it may come as a surprise to Brits, Norfolk's popularity isn't new to Americans. Last year, it came fourth in the same poll.

So what's in Norfolk for tourists? For starters, the city hosts almost-weekly waterfront festivals – such as Harborfest – and is home to Naval Station Norfolk, the largest naval base in the world.

“We have, as the others do, great amenities,” says Allen. “We have a great beach at Ocean View. We have water, great arts and cultural amenities, and our culinary scene is through the roof the last couple of years. There’s a little something for everybody here.”

There's modesty, too, by the looks of it. Allen says that some residents don’t ‘get’ the city's newfound status.

“Our biggest challenge is getting people here to believe,” she said. “It’s always more difficult for residents to see just what they have. Maybe this will help."
