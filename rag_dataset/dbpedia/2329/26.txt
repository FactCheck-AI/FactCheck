News broke Wednesday through a post on John Lydon’s website that UK punk icon Ari Up (born Ariane Forster) has passed away after a long illness. Lydon, (better known as Johnny Rotten) is married to German publishing heiress Nora Forster, making him Ari Up’s step father, so there’s no reason to suspect any kind of punk rock prank.

She was best known as the singer of the Slits, a pioneering female UK punk band, who’s reggae-influenced beats and experimental approach would have an influence far beyond what their record sales would suggest. Their dubbed-out disco-punk cover of I Heard It Through The Grapevine regained new life in the hipster era as a huge anthem at indie dance parties. The growling bass line, scratchy guitars, and wild yelps still sound amazingly modern 30 years later.

The last time we saw her perform was at a Pride event at now-defunct mega-club Circa in 2008. Squeezed into the tiny Bathroom Bar, it wasn’t exactly the ideal scenario, but she was still a commanding presence to be sure.
