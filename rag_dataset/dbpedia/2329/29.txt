Ariane "Ari Up" Forster of The Slits has passed away at 48. Ari Up formed The Slits when she was 14, in 1976. After The Slits split in 1981, she moved with her husband and twin children to jungle regions of Indonesia and Belize, living among indigenous people in those areas. Later, they moved to Jamaica, eventually settling in Kingston. She continued to make music, first with the New Age Steppers, then solo as Baby Ari, Madussa, and Ari Up.
