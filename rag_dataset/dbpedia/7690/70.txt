1 RNSWR - A Brief History and lineage

1 RNSWR traces its ancestry furthest back of all New South Wales battalions, directly to the 1st Sydney Volunteer Rifles, which was formed in Sydney in 1854 as part of the Colony's concern at the possibility of a Russian naval squadron raid associated with the Crimean War.

Interim 'ancestors' through to the Great War were:

From 1860, 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers, comprising 1st (Sydney) and 2nd (Suburban) Battalions;

From 1878, 1st and 2nd Regiments, New South Wales Volunteer Infantry;

From 1903, '1st and 2nd Australian Infantry Regiments.

These units had made substantial contributions to the forces for the Soudan in 1885 and the Boer War 1899 to 1902.

1st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised at Randwick, as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas. Serving with distinction throughout the Gallipoli Campaign, its members Private Keysor and Captain Shout each won a Victoria Cross at Lone Pine in August 1915. 1916 to 1918 saw the Battalion in France and Flanders, Corporal Howell being awarded a Victoria Cross at Second Bullecourt in May 1917

Between World Wars, 1st Battalion AMF, the inheritor of twenty-four Great War Battle Honours, was in 1927 titled The East Sydney Regiment, then in 1937 The City of Sydney's Own Regiment. At various times it was linked with `19th and 45th Battalions. Not serving overseas in the Second World War, it was disbanded in 1944.

The Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/1st Battalion, at Ingleburn in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. Hard service in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea included distinguished action in Crete, nevertheless culminating in surrender on orders from higher command. Its nineteen Battle Honours passed in due course to the 1st Battalion AMF.

From 1954, the '1st Commando Company provided continuity, until its 1957 redesignation and the raising of 1st Infantry Battalion (Commando) (The City of Sydney's Own Regiment). On 1 July 1960, this became No. 1 Company (Commando) (The City of Sydney Company) The Royal New South Wales Regiment, in turn redesignated in 1965 1st Battalion, The Royal New South Wales Regiment (Cdo).

The Commando role was separated from the Regiment] May 1971, 1st Battalion then being linked with the 19th to form 1/19 RNSWR, whose 'Special Conditions', remote location membership role continued until 1995, when all units became able to offer flexible conditions of service.

2 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage

There has been a volunteer infantry presence in Newcastle since 1860, when The Newcastle Volunteer Rifle Corps was formed. The 2nd Battalion traces its lineage through various name changes and reorganisations from this time. Troops from the Newcastle area served in both the Soudan 1885 and Boer War 1899 to 1902 Campaigns.

Recruited generally from Newcastle and the Hunter Valley, the 2nd Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was raised at Randwick as part of 1st Brigade, 1st Division of the expeditionary force for Great War service overseas.

The Second Australian Imperial Force, raised as in the Great War, saw the advent of 2/2nd Battalion, at Ingleburn in October 1939, as part of 16th Brigade, 6th Division. Again recruited largely from the same areas as its Great War predecessor, it created its own distinguished war record in North Africa, Greece, Crete and New Guinea. Lieutenant Chowne was awarded, posthumously, a Victoria Cross for action in the Dagua area, New Guinea in March 1945. The Battalion's fifteen Battle Honours passed in due course to the 2nd Battalion AMF.

The post-war Army restructuring in 1948 included the reformation of 2nd Battalion, based on Newcastle. The 1 July 1960 reorganisation resulted in redesignation as C Company (City of Newcastle Company) 2nd Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment. However, from 1 July 1965, the 2nd Battalion was reformed in its own right as a battalion of The Royal New South Wales Regiment.

In 1968, the battalion was honoured by the Grant of the Freedom of Entry to the City of Newcastle.

The reorganisation of the Army Reserve in 1987caused the linking of the 2nd and 17th Battalions, to form 2/17 RNSWR.

17 RNSWR - A Brief History and lineage

The first volunteer infantry corps to be raised in Sydney's northern metropolitan area was the St. Leonards Volunteer Rifles, in 1860. From this, and through the 1stRegiment, New South Wales Volunteer Infantry and, from 1903 the 1st Australian Infantry Regiment, the 17th Battalion traces its lineage, and from these predecessors it derives the Battle Honours "Suakin, 1885 and "South Africa, 1899-1902".

19 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage

In 1860 the South Sydney Volunteer Corps, a sub‑unit of 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers, was raised. From this colonial era corps, through a complex series of re-designations and reorganisations, 1 9th Infantry Battalion was formed in 192 1.

The 19th Battalion, Australian Imperial Force was formed at Liverpool on 27April 1915 as part of 5th Brigade, 2nd Division, of the now‑enlarged expeditionary force for Great War service overseas.

Lieutenant Colonel Anderson, the Commanding Officer, was awarded the Victoria Cross for actions at Parit Sulong in January 1942.

Battalion AMF, though not raised until somewhat later, was the inheritor of the wartime units 'three and four Battle Honours respectively. Its raising occurred on 12 December 1966, as Battalion The Royal New South Wales Regiment and as a 'Special Conditions' unit, to provide remotely-located persons subject to National Service legislation with the opportunity to exercise the option of Citizen Military Force, rather than Regular Army, service.

On 1 May 1971, the 1st and the 19th Battalions were once again linked, to form 1/19 RNSWR, with a continuation of the 'Special Conditions' role.

41 RNSWR - A Brief History and Lineage

The volunteer infantry presence in the State's Northern Rivers area since 1899 provides the earliest military links for the 41st Battalion. The then Maclean Company Scottish Rifles became, through various reorganisations, the 12th (Byron) Infantry by early in the Great War. Further reorganisations led to the forming in 1921 of41st Infantry Battalion.

The 41st Battalion, Australian Imperial Force, came into existence in the Enoggera area on 1 January 1916, as part of the raising of additional expeditionary force divisions following the evacuation of the 1 stand 2nd Divisions from the Gallipoli Peninsular.

The 41st, originally the 35th but now renumbered, embarked for England on 17May`1916, as part of M th Brigade, 3rd Division. Its recruits were generally from southern Queensland and northern New South Wales.

From December of that ear to May 1918, the battalion played a distinguished part in all significant operations of the AI Fin France and Flanders. In its first major action, Messines Ridge, the whole of the battalion staff was lost to enemy action. Notwithstanding this severe setback, the battalion still performed to a standard warranting receipt of a commendation from the Divisional Commander, (then) Major General John Monash. It has been a matter of pride that no member of 41st Battalion was taken prisoner. The Victoria Cross was awarded to lance Corporal B.S. Gordon, MM, for his gallantry at Bray, France, 26‑27 August 1918. The Battalion was awarded fifteen Battle Honours for its Great War service.

The inheritor of these Battle Honours and traditions was the 41st Battalion AMF whose territorial title 'The Byron Regiment was reconfirmed in 1927.

Between the Great War and Second World War, the battalion experienced various linkages with 2nd and 33rd Battalions, and was re‑activated in its own right in 1937. Though becoming an AI F battalion in 1942, it d id not serve overseas during the Second World War, rather being linked, as 41st/2nd Battalion (AI F) from December 1943. The battalion was disbanded on 17 December 1945.
