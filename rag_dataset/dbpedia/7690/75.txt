The Royal Australian Infantry Corps (RA Inf) is the parent corps for all infantry regiments of the Australian Army. Major components of the RA Inf include the various battalions of the Royal Australian Regiment and Army Reserve regiments eg. Royal New South Wales Regiment. The Infantry School is located at Singleton, New South Wales.

The most common unit in the Australian Army is the Infantry Battalion. It is the smallest Australian Army unit capable of independent operations, and it is exceedingly rare for Australia to deploy a smaller group as a task force. Normally, the Infantry Battalion is supported by armour, light armoured reconnaissance, artillery, aviation, and engineering. There are three types of infantry battalion, mechanised infantry, motorised infantry, and light infantry. Mechanised infantry are equipped with heavy vehicles, the primary vehicle being the M113AS3/4. Lighter infantry units normally proceed on foot, though they have Bushmaster IMV's for tactical, and strategic mobility. Airborne infantry are dropped into action by RAAF aircraft. Reserve battalions are all light infantry, and usually use Landrovers for mobility.

The battalions are referred to as part of Regiments, though the Regiment itself is not a tactical organisation. The Australian Army has the following infantry regiments:

Royal Australian Regiment (ARA only)

Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment (ARA, and ARes)

Royal New South Wales Regiment (ARes)

Royal Pacific Islands Regiment (ARes)

Royal Queensland Regiment (ARes)

Royal South Australia Regiment (ARes)

Royal Tasmania Regiment (ARes)

Royal Victoria Regiment (ARes)

Royal Western Australia Regiment (ARes)

The Royal Australian Regiment was raised in 1948 to take part in the occupation of Japan after the Second World War. It was formed from personnel from Second AIF personnel serving in the South West Pacific. The Regiment subsequently became the basis of the Australian Regular Army. It saw its first combat in the Korean War. It served later in Malaya and Borneo, and after an expansion in the 1960s with National Service it served in Vietnam. The Royal Australian Regiment has performed peacekeeping duties in troublespots, and has performed public duties in Buckingham Palace as the Queen's Guard. All Australian regular infantry recruited outside New Zealand. The Royal Australian regiment has ten regular battalions.

The Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment was the basis of the New Zealand Army. It was formed in 1947. Like the RAR, it has served in Malaya, Borneo, and Vietnam. Today, the RNZIR is the regiment of all Australian Army infantry recruited in New Zealand. It has two regular and two reserve battalions.

Organisation[]

The below organisations are for an Airborne Infantry Battalion. All other infantry battalions are changed by the addition of vehicles. All Australian Infantry Battalions that are not airborne are fully mobile with their own vehicles. Mechanised Infantry use the M113AS3/4, motorised Infantry use the Bushmaster IMV, and light infantry use walk, or use trucks for ground mobility.

Rifle Platoon[]

The basic unit is the Infantry Platoon. It consists of three sections and a platoon headquarters.

Infantry Section[]

The infantry section consists of two fire teams. Each team consists of 4 men. One team is led by a Corporal (the Section Commander), and the other by a Lance Corporal (the Section 2IC). The infantry section is equipped and manned as follows.

Fireteam Bravo

Team Leader (CPL) - F88

Marksman - F88S with an Elcan sight (he can also carry thermal sights, or an off-angle sight1)

Grenadier - F88 GLA

Light Support Weapon Operator - F89 Minimi

Fireteam Delta

Team Leader (LCPL) - F88

Marksman - F88S with an Elcan sight (he can also carry thermal sights, or an off-angle sight1)

Grenadier - F88 GLA

Light Support Weapon Operator - F89 Minimi

1The Off-Axis Viewing Device is a simple, periscopic Australian designed sight. It fits behind any conventional scope, and gives a 50o view angle, and is far superior to video-based installations being simpler, more reliable, and more ergonomic.

Platoon Headquarters[]

The HQ Team consists of the Platoon Commander, Platoon Sergeant, Platoon Signaller, and Platoon Medic. Although all teams have at least one short range radio, the HQ Team radio is more capable. Likewise, all teammembers have some first aid training, and a member from each team has more advanced training, but the HQ Team medic is effectively as well trained as a civilian paramedic.

Rifle Company[]

A Rifle Company consists of 3 Rifle Platoons, a Support Section, and a Company Headquarters.

The Support Section consists of ten men organised into two Support Fire Teams. A Support Fire Team consists of a Team Leader, a Machine Gunner and his Number Two equipped with a MAG 58 and tripod, and a Recoilless Rifle Gunner and his Number Two equipped with an 84mm Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. The Number Twos carry ammunition, protect the gunner, and in the case of the machine gunner, carry a spare barrel and tripod.

The Company Headquarters consists of the Company Officer Commanding, his Second in Command, a Company Sergeant Major, and thirteen other ranks.

Infantry Battalion[]

The Infantry Battalion consists of a Battalion Headquarters, four Rifle Companies, an Administration Company, and a Support Company.
