Double Dragon (1987) was one of the best arcade games ever made. The story is simple, it involves two brothers. One of their girlfriends is beaten up and dragged off by some sleazy dirt bags. The two of you have to find her and fight your way through a savage gauntlet of knife throwing punks, women with whips, thug wielding baseball bats and huge

overmuscled fighters. What makes this game fun it that weapons can be used (i.e. thrown, hit with, or wield). Even garbage cans, crates and metal containers can be used! The game is whole lot more exciting when two players team up. It's a nice way to lose a dollar. One of the few arcade games that can last a long time.

Highly recommended, if you can find a machine!
