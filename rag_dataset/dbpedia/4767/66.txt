An International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a number that identifies a serial publication and is used in orders, catalogues, libraries, and other matters relating to serial literature.

The International Standard serial Number (ISSN) Generator generates eight-digit codes divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.

You can also generate ISSNs in the 13-digit format. For this, select the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN-13) generator.

The dialog box of the ISSN Generator contains some of the Basic Settings. You can customize the generator by changing the basic settings.
