Bonerama has always been hailed as “unlike anything you’ve ever heard before”…

As their sound evolves and changes it’s still the best way to describe this 18 year old powerhouse trombone touring band from New Orleans, LA. In addition to changing the way people think about the trombone, the sound of Bonerama has become an influence and contribution to the sound of New Orleans music today.

With newer acts such as Trombone Shorty and Big Sam’s Funky Nation joining them on on the national music scene, it’s New Orleans that has benefited with a newfound reputation as being a bonafide “Trombone Town”. These bands carry the trombone like the trophy it truly is in New Orleans.

The band has performed and recorded with countless national artists such as R.E.M., OKGo, Tom Morello, Wayne Kramer (MC5), Jill Sobule and so many more, all while bringing their distinctive sounds from New Orleans to a national spotlight.

Festivals and events such as Monterey Jazz Fest to High Sierra Music Festival, Jam Cruise, Bear Creek Festival and of course the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival only outline the extensive festival work this band has under its’ name. National television appearances on CNN and HBO (Comic Relief, Treme) have further exposed Bonerama to a wide range of unsuspecting new viewers.

While enduring lineup changes, member displacement, tragedy and loss over the years, the song for Bonerama has remained the same; being centered around their beloved trombone & city, while striving for greatness with a fun spirit.

Whether it’s their inventive covers or funky, rocking originals, Bonerama is calling you to Shake It Baby. To the left and to the right. Or anyway you like it, and all in between. Rest assured, Bonerama will take you on your most memorable RIDE ON THE SLIDE!
