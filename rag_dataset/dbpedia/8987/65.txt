Metalcore veterans Botch, hailing from Washington State, are set to extend their recent reunion run in March with performances in the UK and Europe. Following this, the band has revealed plans for a brief Australian tour in May.

Botch made a notable comeback in 2022, dropping their first single in two decades in August. Shortly after, they surprised fans by appearing as special guests at a birthday show in Seattle, WA. Following this unexpected performance, the band officially announced a pair of reunion shows, which later expanded into a nationwide tour and beyond.

The band shared:
