Geoff Love & His Orchestra has been played on NTS in shows including Uncanny Valley w/ Peter J Doyle, featured first on 4 March 2016. Songs played include Siboney, Psycho and Vaya Con Dios.

Geoff Love Orchestra was a newcomer to the beautiful music category, yet his arrangements included many old standards done in his style. He used a slight "soul" sound, which attracted music lovers of all races, a pleasant change. You will love listening the the great arrangements from Geoff Love Orchestra on Last fm.
