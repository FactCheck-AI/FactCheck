Fractal Design Torrent Compact cables

Anyone here have this case? I know there's not much of a difference between it & the Torrent, other than space & fans.

But there's a dual cable that I need to know what it's for so that I can continue my build.

There's 2 sets of plugs on one wire. One comes with a protective cap on it that is a small 3 prong while the secondary is a 3 prong female. Are these to daisy chain compatible fans with the front 2? If they are, I can tuck those out of the way.

I wasn't able to get the same brand of fans as the front. (Prism)

This case has 14 connectors and none are labelled in any way other than the HD Audio & the front headers.
