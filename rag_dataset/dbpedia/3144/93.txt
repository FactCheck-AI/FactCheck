I am delighted to announce that we have been accepted as an associate member of the HMC (the Headmasters' & Headmistresses' Conference) which is a professional association of heads of the world's leading independent schools. We are only one of five state schools who are associate members of this prestigious organisation.

We are very proud to be a state funded school, but due to our status as one of the largest boarding schools in the country, we have much in common with our counterparts in the independent sector. We are committed to continued school development and collaboration and I am sure that working with national networks through the HMC, BSA (Boarding School Association) and SBF (State Boarding Forum) will benefit our students and staff and help further cement our world class reputation.
