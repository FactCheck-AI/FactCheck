Stone Ponies Affiliation Mercenary Parent Command Independent

History[edit]

Formed by a former member of the Black Omen mercenary company, the Stone Ponies signed contracts to fight in the Clan wars in the Periphery. The unit required only transportation to the planet, a facility to work on their machines, and just enough money to buy any supplies needed. Currently, they have a contract with the Circinus Federation and are stationed on Clayborne II.

During the Jihad, the unit was listed as wanted because of their contract with the WoB affiliated Circinus Federation.
