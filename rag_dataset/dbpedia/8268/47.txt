On April 26, 2021, Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan of the House introduced a bill to grant official federal recognition of Arab American Heritage Month.

Hereâs what she had to say about it:

As a strong, proud, and unapologetically Arab American woman in Congress, it is an honor to introduce this new Arab American Heritage Month resolution uplifting our contributions to this nation. This resolution is a symbol of our utmost appreciation and thanks for the contributions Arab Americans have made for generations and the ones to come that will no doubt continue our historic legacy. Our love and pursuit of freedom, justice, and equity makes this country a better place and I look forward to seeing that officially recognized.

Take this opportunity to teach your students that Arab American heritage and history are an integral part of Americaâs past, present, and future.
