Abstract

This thesis explores modernism's temporality and location through the examination of Arabic modernism's occurrence. In this thesis, I question whether the authenticity of modernism derives from its temporality period or its literary content while concurrently investigating several poems by Lebanese authors Kahlil Gibran and Nadia Tuéni and Syrian poet Adonis. Additionally, I trace Arabic modernism's influence to the early 1900s-1910s to the conception of the Mahjar movement and the Pen League, an Arabic literary society consisting of Arabic immigrant writers. As I discern the political impact within Arabic writings, I explore political events, such as World War I and its aftermath, that heavily influenced Arabic literature and modernism. Subsequently, I acknowledge Lebanon's position in both a colonial and postcolonial context and dispute the simple notion that the Eastern world entirely comprises Western practices and traditions. I accomplish this by exploring Nadia Tuéni's contribution to Arabic modernism through the dual questions of translation and postcolonial theory. By considering these critical political and literary factors, I hope to call attention to Arabic modernism's influence and temporality.
