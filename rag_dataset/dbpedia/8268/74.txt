While many of the editors of the early papers were major cultural and political figures themselves, they also supported and published a younger generation of writers. Informed by an-Nahdah and shaped by their immigrant experience and contemporary American letters – at times inspired by writers such as Emerson and Whitman – these younger journalists and poets in New York experimented with new Arabic literary forms. They sought to break from the classical, calling for a new understanding of the written word.

The Mahjar writers included monumental figures of contemporary Arabic letters such as Gibran Kahlil Gibran, Nasib Arida, Rashid Ayoub, Abdul Massih Haddad, Nudra Haddad, Elia Abu Madi, and Mikhail Naimy. In 1916, a group of these figures inaugurated the literary organization known as the Pen Bond (ar-Rabitah al-Qalamiyah), which published its first writing in the journal Al-Funun (The Arts). The Pen Bond was reconstituted in 1920, becoming the most important manifestation of Mahjar writing in the new world.

Perhaps the greatest testament to its influence for western audiences was the publication of Gibran’s best-known work,The Prophet. Translated into over 100 languages, it is one of the best-selling books in history, and it has never been out of print. More profoundly, the cultural dynamism of these writers in diaspora and their impact on Arabic literature and popular culture is recognized among Arab populations around the world. Even today, their work is studied in secondary schools, defended in doctoral dissertations, celebrated in song and recited on street corners, in tea halls throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Perhaps no other foreign-language movement originating in New York has had as broad an impact.
