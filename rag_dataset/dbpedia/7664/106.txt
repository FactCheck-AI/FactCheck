For the past 10 years, Voice of OC has delivered consistently fair, focused and thorough civic and arts journalism to Orange County California’s 3.5 million residents. We are now widely recognized as the civic news of record. We encourage civic engagement and civil discourse through our editorial pages, community forums and social channels. We are vigilant advocates for first amendment rights and have won every lawsuit we have pursued. Voice of OC journalists are empowered and encouraged to dive daily into the mechanics of Orange County’s cities and government agencies engaging on stories that affect real people and hold powerful interests accountable. Our news is delivered daily on our website and via social media. Our reporters frequently appear on local public radio. We also have content agreements with the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times on election coverage.
