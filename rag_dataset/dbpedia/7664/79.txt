The Hilbert Museum of California Art is home to one of the world’s largest collections of California narrative art.

And it’s about to get even bigger.

Located in Old Towne Orange near Chapman University, the museum expansion is currently undergoing major construction, allowing for expansion from 7,500 square feet to 22,000.
