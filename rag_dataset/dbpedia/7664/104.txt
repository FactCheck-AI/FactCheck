Voice of OC in California went all out for Sunshine Week, changing its branding to Noise of OC and highlighting their successes in shining a light on government.

During this year’s Sunshine Week we celebrate being called the “Noise of OC” for making abundant public records requests. While we encourage civic engagement year-round, this week we are offering extra guides on how to follow and participate in local quality of life debates.
