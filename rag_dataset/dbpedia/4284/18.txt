Checklist

In the following species accounts, we present information on systematics, distribution and conservation status of new species records for the wider Bumbuna area and Loma in 2014 and 2016. For species already documented from Bumbuna I (Decher et al. 2010) and encountered in our study, we only list new information. Species only found in Bumbuna I and previous records from within a radius of 40 km (Suppl. material 4) are included in Table . If not otherwise mentioned, females did not show signs of reproductive activity.

Order Chiroptera

Family Pteropodidae

Micropteropus pusillus (Peters, 1868) Peters's Dwarf Epauletted Fruit Bat

Eight individuals were captured in Bumbuna II in savannah habitats in 2014 (B3), and 19 individuals at the same site and along rivers in 2016 (B3, B7, B8). Out of the 27 individuals, 17 were females. Two females were pregnant (30 + 31 Mar) and five were lactating (6 + 7 Apr, 28 May).

Epomops buettikoferi (Matschie, 1899) Buettikofer's Epauletted Fruit Bat

With 49 individuals (Bumbuna II: 45, Loma: 4), this was the second most frequently encountered fruit bat species in our study. In Bumbuna II, the species was found at five sites (B3, B4, B6, B7, B8) in savannah and riparian forest habitats in varying condition. We captured 19 females, including one pregnant (30 Mar) and six lactating (24, 30, 31 Mar, 1 + 7 Apr) females.

Eidolon helvum (Kerr, 1792) African Straw-coloured Fruit Bat

Four individuals of this species were captured, two in Bumbuna II (B7) and two in Loma, representing new records for both areas. All four individuals were encountered between agricultural lands and riparian forests. Eidolon helvum is known from several other localities, mostly day roosts, across the country (Grubb et al. 1998). The species often forms large colonies comprising up to several thousand or millions of individuals. In West Africa, colonies are frequently situated in cities, in Sierra Leone e.g. in Freetown and Makeni (N. Weber pers. observation). Eidolon helvum is migratory and its presence in Bumbuna II and Loma is probably seasonal. It is ranked as “Near Threatened” by the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2019) and included on Appendix II of the Convention for the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). This fruit bat is threatened by unsustainable hunting throughout its range, as has been examined, for instance, in Ghana (Kamins et al. 2011).

Hypsignathus monstrosus H. Allen, 1861 Hammer-headed Fruit Bat

Male individuals of this largest African bat were heard calling in Loma and one sub-adult female was captured with a canopy net in Bumbuna II in 2016 (B7). Hypsignathus monstrosus was known from the Loma Mountains prior to this study (Atkinson et al. 1996, Grubb et al. 1998), but not from Bumbuna. The species is usually encountered in forest habitats.

Rousettus aegyptiacus (E. Geoffroy, 1810) Egyptian Fruit Bat

We captured 17 individuals of the Egyptian fruit bat in our study in 2016 (B4, B8: 5, Lo1: 12). One of eight females was lactating (7 Apr). We further observed a few individuals of this fruit bat at the entrance of a cavity in Sadia Konkoma (Loa) by day. A local guide reported that the majority of individuals disappeared shortly before our visit, probably due to a recent fire which burnt much of the vegetation on the rocky slope. Another approximately 60 individuals were counted in Yafarama cave (Bb). The species is hunted for bushmeat at day roosts in the area.

Myonycteris leptodon K. Andersen, 1908 Sierra Leone Collared Fruit Bat

We encountered six individuals of M. leptodon at three sites in Bumbuna II (B1, B3, B8). Three of them were females, including one which was lactating (7 Apr).

Myonycteris angolensis smithii (Thomas, 1908) Angolan Fruit Bat

Five females of this fruit bat were recorded in Loma and one male in hilly woodland savannah in Bumbuna II (B3). Two females were lactating (25 Mar). The few previous records from Sierra Leone are patchily distributed, and include the type specimen for this taxon (Grubb et al. 1998). Myonycteris angolensis smithii uses particular caves and hollow trees as day roost and might be restricted to mountainous forest habitats.

Nanonycteris veldkampii (Jentink, 1888) Veldkamp's Epauletted Fruit Bat

With a total of 94 individuals, this species constituted the most numerous species in our study, all of them recorded in 2016. Veldkamp's bat was common in Loma (n = 44 individuals) and occurred at four sites in Bumbuna II (n = 50 individuals; B3, B4, B7, B8). Females were represented by 47 individuals, 28 being adult. Out of these, five were pregnant (25, 30, 31 Mar, 2 Apr) and eleven lactating (25, 27, 30, 31 Mar, 1, 3, 7, 8 Apr). The species was likely absent from the study area in 2014.

Family Rhinolophidae

Rhinolophus landeri Martin, 1838 Lander's Horseshoe Bat

Two males of R. landeri were captured on rocky slopes (B1) in 2014. Forearm length (43.4-43.9 mm) and cf frequency were in the typical range of this species (Table ; Happold 2013a). We observed one individual emerging from an underground cave at B1 shortly after sunset, indicating a day roost of this horseshoe bat (21 May). Rhinolophus landeri generally depends on caves or similar structures as roosting habitat. It is distributed in much of sub-Saharan Africa and occurs mainly in savannahs and riparian forests with rocky features. The species was previously known from few records in Sierra Leone, including the Loma Mountains (Grubb et al. 1998).

Rhinolophus guineensis Eisentraut, 1960 Guinean Horseshoe Bat

One pregnant female was recorded in riparian forest at the Yogoron River (B7) in 2016 (30 Mar). Forearm length (46.8 mm) and echolocation frequency of this individual fit with previous observations (Table ; Fahr 2013a). Rhinolophus guineensis is listed as “Vulnerable” by the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2019).

Rhinolophus fumigatus Sanborn, 1939 Rüppell's Horseshoe Bat

This horseshoe bat was tentatively identified by echolocation recordings from Yafarama cave (Bb; Table ; Cotterill and Happold 2013) and the relatively large size of individuals observed in flight. It was sharing this day roost with Hipposideros aff. ruber and Rousettus aegyptiacus.

Family Hipposideridae

Hipposideros marisae Aellen, 1954 Aellen’s Leaf-nosed Bat

In 2014, five individuals of this small leaf-nosed bat (Fig. ) were recorded in riparian forest at B1, where they emerged from rock cavities underneath a slope. A sixth individual was captured at a stagnant pool surrounded by Raphia palms at B3. The three females were lactating (21, 22, 28 May). Echolocation call frequencies of two males and two females of Aellen’s leaf-nosed bat match previous recordings of this species from Liberian Mount Nimba (Table ; Monadjem et al. 2013).

This constitutes the first record of H. marisae for Sierra Leone and only the ninth observation of this species in total, with seven records dating back to at least 1990 (Koopman et al. 1995, Fahr 2013b, Monadjem et al. 2016). The Wonegizi Mountains in northwest Liberia constitute the nearest documented location for H. marisae (Koopman et al. 1995), at a distance of more than 250 km from our study area. Prior to this study, this species was only known from Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea (Fahr 2013b, Monadjem et al. 2016). Hipposideros marisae is ranked as “Vulnerable” by the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2019). Evidence suggests that H. marisae is extremely rare within a restricted range, likely as it depends on suitable caves as day roost and forest habitats. Major threats to this species comprise loss of foraging and roosting habitat through deforestation, mining and other anthropogenic activities. Despite re-visiting the same localities as in 2014, the species was not encountered in the 2016 survey.

Hipposideros aff. ruber (Noack, 1893) Noack's Roundleaf Bat

Hipposideros aff. ruber belongs to the wider H. caffer/ruber species complex, which shows a high level of cryptic diversity based on Cyt-b (Vallo et al. 2008, Vallo et al. 2011, Hauslaib-Haidn 2011, Monadjem et al. 2013). Bats belonging to this species group were encountered at all study sites in Bumbuna II (2014: n = 68, 2016: n = 13) including the two caves and in Loma (n = 1), resulting in a total of 82 captures. High variation in forearm length and echolocation call frequency (Table ) indicated that more than one genetic lineage was involved in our samples, but species identification with morphology and echolocation alone is currently not possible in this taxon. Following Vallo et al. (2008), analyses of mitochondrial Cyt-b sequences revealed that at least two distinct lineages (C1 and D) occurred in the Bumbuna areas. Further genetic and morphological studies are required to establish species boundaries and assign valid names.

Hipposideros aff. ruber C1 was represented by five samples in the genetic sequencing (Fig. ), with four bats from this study, captured at four sites (B1, B4, B7, B8) in 2016. The two females were pregnant (1 + 7 Apr). The echolocation call frequencies of the individuals sampled had an unusually wide range for a hipposiderid bat (Table ). Lineage C1 seems to occur in the forest zone of West and Central Africa, but additional data are needed to corroborate this assumption. Recently, the taxon was reported from Mount Nimba in Liberia (Monadjem et al. 2016).

Genetic sequencing revealed that 13 samples belonged to Hipposideros aff. ruber D. Eight of these bats were from six sites visited in this study (B1, B2, B4, B5, B6, Lo1). One of four females was pregnant (24 Mar) and one was lactating (2 Apr). Echolocation call frequencies of two males were higher than the frequencies used by four females (Table ). Frequency differences between males and females have previously been observed in lineage D1 (Vallo et al. 2011). Hipposideros aff. ruber D is currently only known from forested areas in West Africa. The majority of our specimens groups with individuals from lineage D1 (Vallo et al. 2011). Three bats form a distinct branch on the phylogenetic tree as sister taxon to lineage D1 and might constitute another lineage (Fig. ;Hauslaib-Haidn 2011, Herkt et al. 2016 Suppl. material).

Hipposideros abae J.A. Allen, 1917 Aba Leaf-nosed Bat

We captured two females of the Aba roundleaf bat at Kamin Mata (Ba) during the day, one was lactating (24 May). At the time of visit, the cave harboured a colony of roughly 100 individuals of this species and around 300 individuals of Hipposideros aff. ruber. Two males were caught around the transmission line (B5) near Kamin Mata, just on the other side of Seli River. The cf frequency of one female (Table ) was recorded and appears to be the first recording of this species.

Macronycteris vittatus (Peters, 1852) Striped Leaf-nosed Bat

Macronycteris has long been considered a synonym of Hipposideros. We follow Foley et al. (2017) in recognising the genus Macronycteris as paraphyletic to Hipposideros, based on genetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences as well as morphological diagnoses (Vallo et al. 2008, Monadjem et al. 2013, Foley et al. 2017).

We recorded two individuals of this large hipposiderid in 2016, one pregnant female (26 Mar; Fig. ) in Loma and one sub-adult male in a canopy net across the Makarikari River (B8). Echolocation frequencies were well above 60 kHz (Table ; Happold 2013b), which excludes the morphologically similar M. gigas that is known to use lower frequencies up to 56 kHz. The striped leaf-nosed bat or M. gigas was also observed in Bumbuna I, but the individual was not clearly identified (Decher et al. 2010). Macronycteris vittatus is listed as “Near Threatened” on the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2019). The records from our study areas represent the second and third confirmed localities for the species in Sierra Leone, the first one being from Fadugu near Bumbuna II (Grubb et al. 1998 [as Hipposideros commersoni]). Macronycteris vittatus has a scattered distribution in West Africa and its population is considered to be declining due to loss or disturbance of suitable habitat and hunting. The species depends at least partially on caves as day roost.

Doryrhina cyclops (Peters 1871) Cyclops Leaf-nosed Bat

We follow Foley et al. (2017) in raising Doryrhina to genus level and recognising it as paraphyletic to Hipposideros, based on genetic analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences as well as morphological diagnoses (Vallo et al. 2008, Monadjem et al. 2013, Foley et al. 2017).

We captured four individuals of Cyclops leaf-nosed bat in 2014, two males and two females which were both lactating (26 + 28 May). One female was encountered at B3, the other three individuals were captured when emerging from their day roost, a hollow tree on a freshly burnt field at B2. Echolocation calls of the two females were recorded and frequencies were in the common range of D. cyclops (Table ; Fahr 2013c).

Family Nycteridae

Nycteris arge Thomas, 1903 Bates's Slit-faced Bat

One male was captured in riparian forest at B1.

Nycteris grandis Peters, 1865 Large Slit-faced Bat

One male of the large slit-faced bat was recorded in wooded savannah at B6, representing the third record for Sierra Leone (Decher et al. 2010).

Nycteris macrotis Dobson, 1876 Large-eared Slit-faced Bat

We captured two males of this species, one in forest at B1 and one in degraded riparian forest at the Seli River (B4). The large-eared slit-faced bat is a widespread species, which has been previously documented from several other localities in Sierra Leone (Grubb et al. 1998). Nycteris macrotis occurs in a variety of habitats and it uses caves and hollow trees as day roost.

Nycteris thebaica E. Geoffroy, 1818 Egyptian Slit-faced Bat

Three individuals of N. thebaica were recorded in Bumbuna II, all in riparian forest at the cave system at B1, one male and one female in 2014, and one sub-adult female in 2016. Nycteris thebaica is difficult to distinguish from N. gambiensis, but the latter is smaller than N. thebaica in West Africa (Van Cakenberghe and De Vree 1998). Forearm lengths of our adult individuals were rather in the range of N. thebaica (42.4 and 43.1 mm). Fur colouration also points to N. thebaica, as all individuals had a much lighter ventral than dorsal fur. There are two previous record of N. thebaica from Sierra Leone, from Freetown and Mongberi near Bo (Van Cakenberghe and De Vree 1998). This species occurs predominantly in wooded savannahs in West Africa. It requires caves or cave-like structures as day roost.

Nycteris hispida (Schreber, 1775) Hairy Slit-faced Bat

Four individuals were found roosting in an open cavity under a large rock in a partly dried out riverbed near B2 during the day. One adult and one sub-adult flew off, but one lactating female (25 May) was captured with a young attached. Nycteris hispida is known from other locations in the Northern Province (Van Cakenberghe and De Vree 1993), and it is generally found in different habitats from savannahs to forests.

Family Emballonuridae

Coleura afra (Peters, 1852) African Sheath-tailed Bat

We captured one male of this emballonurid bat in riparian forest at B4 in 2016 (Fig. ). This record of C. afra constitutes the first for Sierra Leone, alongside a colony comprising several hundred individuals observed on Bunce Island, a small island in the estuary of the Rokel River, in 2014 (N. Weber pers. observation; iNaturalist.org 2019). In West Africa, Coleura afra has a patchy distribution in savannah and savannah transition zones (Benin, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Côte d'Ivoire, Nigeria, Togo; Happold 2013c). It requires caves or cave-like structures as day roost.

Family Vespertilionidae

Myotis bocagii (Peters, 1870) Rufous Mouse-eared Bat

A total of seven individuals was obtained in both study periods. Six records were from the Seli River (B5, B6) and one individual was captured over Makarikari River (B8). The single female was pregnant (4 Jun).

Pipistrellus nanulus Thomas, 1904 Tiny Pipistrelle

We recorded one male and one female in 2014 (B4, B6). The tiny pipistrelle was previously documented from four localities in the country (Grubb et al. 1998).

Scotoecus hirundo (de Winton, 1899) Dark-winged Lesser House Bat

Our capture represents the second record of S. hirundo for Sierra Leone, the first is from Musaia approximately 50 km north of our locality (Grubb et al. 1998). The female was captured over rocks in the Seli River near the access road (B6). This species seems to be mainly associated with savannah habitats.

Scotophilus viridis (Peters, 1852) Green House Bat

We captured one male in the savannah landscape at B3. Grubb et al. (1998) mention two historic records from the north of Sierra Leone, which refer to S. viridis [as S. nigritellus]. Taxonomic relationships within the genus Scotophilus are currently not clear and need a revision (Vallo et al. 2016, Demos et al. 2018). The green house bat is associated with savannahs and woodlands.

Scotophilus nux Thomas, 1904 Nut-coloured Yellow Bat

One male was captured over a swamp at the forest edge in Loma. The nut-coloured yellow bat has been previously recorded from the rainforest zone in southern Sierra Leone. Our record constitutes the northernmost locality of this species to date, with the nearest record from 10 miles north of Panguma, 100 km to the south of Loma (Grubb et al. 1998 [as S. dinganii nux]). The distribution of S. nux in West Africa ranges from Sierra Leone to Ghana in the rainforest zone and continues eastwards in Nigeria.

Scotophilus dinganii (A. Smith, 1833) Yellow-bellied House Bat

Our samples included two pregnant females (7 Apr, 29 May). We encountered one bat in woodland savannah (B3), and one over the Makarikari River (B8). The yellow-bellied house bat was previously known from three localities in Sierra Leone, Bonthe (Robbins et al. 1985), Kent (ROM 62749) and Njala (MRAC 35641, 35685). The species occurs mainly in woodlands and savannahs.

Glauconycteris poensis (Gray, 1842) Abo Butterfly Bat

We recorded a total of six males of this species in both study periods and areas. Four individuals were captured at B5 in 2014 after emergence from their day roost. One individual was caught over a small river at B7 and one individual was from Loma. Glauconycteris poensis is known from several localities in the south of Sierra Leone (Hayman and Jones 1950, Grubb et al. 1998). Fur colour of this bat is highly variable, indicating that the name G. poensis might generally refer to more than one species. All our specimens had a pale cream-brown to greyish colour, two whitish shoulder spots dorsally, and two whitish lateral bands dorsally, the latter being a typical character of the species in West Africa (Fig. ).

Family Molossidae

Chaerephon nigeriae nigeriae Thomas, 1913 Nigerian Free-tailed Bat

We captured one nulliparous female in Loma, which constitutes the second record of this savannah species for Sierra Leone. The first record is from east of Fintonia in Outamba-Kilimi National Park (Grubb et al. 1998), approximately 120 km west-northwest from our site.

Mops condylurus (A. Smith, 1833) Angolan Free-tailed Bat

Seven individuals of this molossid bat were captured with canopy nets, three in savannah habitats (B3), one over Makarikari River (B8) and three in Loma. There are several previous records of M. condylurus from Sierra Leone (Grubb et al. 1998). The species is widely distributed in a broad range of habitats including agricultural landscapes. Natural day roosts are in tree openings, but Angolan free-tailed bats also use roofs and other anthropogenic structures for roosting.

Mops nanulus J. A. Allen, 1917 Dwarf Free-tailed Bat

This very small molossid was only encountered in Loma. Of the six individuals, four were females, one being pregnant (26 Mar). Our record is the third of M. nanulus for the country (Grubb et al. 1998 [as Tadarida nanula]). The locality at the fringe of the Loma Mountains corresponds to previous findings, which suggest that this species is associated with forest and forest edge habitats.

Mops thersites (Thomas, 1903) Railer Free-tailed Bat

A single female of this species was recorded in Loma. Mops thersites was previously documented from several localities in the southern half of the country (Rosevear 1965, Grubb et al. 1998 [as Tadarida thersites]). In general, this molossid bat occurs in forest habitats.

Mops trevori J.A. Allen, 1917 Trevor's Free-tailed Bat

We recorded two females of this rarely observed bat in Loma, one being pregnant (25 Mar; Fig. ). M. trevori is documented for the first time from Sierra Leone. Our record constitutes the westernmost locality of this species, with a range extension of roughly 310 km. The nearest known site is in the Mount Béro Forest Reserve in southeastern Guinea (Fahr et al. 2006). Mops trevori is listed as “Data Deficient” by the IUCN Red List (IUCN 2019). It is known from a few disjunct records in forest-savannah mosaic habitats, with the easternmost in Uganda (Happold 2013d).

Order Soricomorpha

Family Soricidae

Crocidura olivieri (Lesson, 1827) Olivier’s Shrew, African Giant Shrew

One individual of this large common shrew was captured in a pitfall trap close to the Seli River at B2. The species is found in a wide variety of habitats including forest, savannah, degraded forest, farmbush, shrubland and forest clearings in most of sub-Saharan Africa (Churchfield and Hutterer 2013). Crocidura olivieri is also often found near human settlements (IUCN 2019). There are numerous localities of this species in Sierra Leone (Grubb et al. 1998). Following Jacquet et al. (2015), our specimen belongs to clade I, which is associated with West African rain forests. Our individual was captured in microhabitat with no canopy cover.

Crocidura cf. theresae (Heim de Balsac, 1968) Therese’s Shrew

One male was captured in a pitfall trap at B9. This species was tentatively assigned to C. theresae based on morphological characteristics (head-body length: 89.0 mm, tail: 62.0 mm, hind foot: 15.0 mm, ear: 6.9 mm, body mass: 14.5 g). Molecular analyses supported another position within the C. poensis species group, C. grandiceps (Jacquet et al. 2012), but this species was ruled out due to significant morphological differences. There are several other localities of this species throughout Sierra Leone (Grubb et al. 1998). Crocidura theresae has been recorded from mixed forest, grassland and rice fields (Heim de Balsac 1968). It occurs in West Africa in the savannahs from Guinea to Ghana. Our individual was captured in microhabitat with 5% canopy cover.

Crocidura sp.1

One pregnant female of this shrew was captured at B1 (22 May). This individual also belongs to the C. poensis species complex. Our specimen shares morphological characteristics with C. longipes (head-body length: 93.0 mm, tail: 59.0 mm, hind foot: 15.3 mm, ear: 7.3 mm, body mass: 19.0 g), but the genetic identification is not clear and requires further information and reference sequences. Our individual was captured in microhabitat with 75% canopy cover. The C. poensis species complex comprises large-sized species that are distributed throughout the Guinea-Congolian rainforests and savannahs. Taxonomic relationships within this group are currently not resolved and a revision based on morphological and genetic studies is urgently needed.

Order Rodentia

Family Nesomyidae

Cricetomys gambianus (Wroughton, 1910) Gambian Giant Pouched Rat, Giant Rat

Seven individuals (2 males, 4 females, 1 unspecified) of this large rodent were captured in Tomahawk traps at all sites except for B3. All but two individuals were caught in forest vegetation, one female on a branch at about 2 m height. One female was lactating (28 May). Three voucher specimens were identified as C. gambianus based on morphological and molecular analyses. The species occurs in grassland, woodland and anthropogenic habitats in the northern savannahs of West and Central Africa (Monadjem et al. 2015) and throughout Sierra Leone (Grubb et al. 1998). Compared to the distribution range and genetic sequences in Olayemi et al. (2012), our specimens belong to clade III. Our individuals were captured in microhabitat with an average of 52% canopy cover.

Family Muridae

Gerbilliscus kempi (Wroughton, 1906) Kemp's or Northern Savannah Gerbil

One male of this common West and Central African gerbil was obtained at B5 in savannah with elephant grass. This species can be distinguished from the less common G. guineae, which is restricted to northern Sierra Leone, by its shorter, untufted tail (Granjon et al. 2012). It is widespread in savannahs from southern Senegal to Sudan (Grubb et al. 1998 [as Tatera kempii], Volobouev et al. 2007, Monadjem et al. 2015) where it inhabits grass- and farmland. Our individual was captured in microhabitat with no canopy cover.

Lophuromys sikapusi (Temminck, 1853) Rusty-bellied Brush-furred Rat

One male of this distinctive orange-bellied rat was captured in a valley with fields at B9 in a pitfall trap set in dense tall elephant grass. This individual was captured in microhabitat with no canopy cover.

Uranomys ruddi (Dollmann, 1909) Rudd's Brush-furred Mouse

Only one female of this distinctive savannah and open woodland mouse was caught at the edge of a field at B9. The species is very rare in surveys of small mammals (Happold 2013) and in museum collections. Uranomys ruddi occurs from Senegal eastwards in the savannah zone to Zimbabwe and Mozambique, preferably in savannahs with ravine or similar forests (Denys et al. 2009). This widespread but patchily distributed taxon most likely includes several distinct but morphologically cryptic species. This individual was captured in microhabitat with no canopy cover.

Hylomyscus simus (Allen and Coolidge, 1930) West African Wood Mouse

One male of this arboreal species was caught on a branch in young forest at B5. We follow Nicolas et al. (2006) in using H. simus for the common West African form. The potentially sympatric species H. baeri can be distinguished from H. simus by its pure white ventral pelage. The one individual was captured in microhabitat with 90.0% canopy cover.

Lemniscomys striatus (Linnaeus, 1758) Typical Striped Grass Mouse

Seven individuals (2 male, 2 female, 3 unspecified) of this striped grass mouse were caught at three sites, mostly in savannahs with elephant grass (B5, B9) or termite mounds (B3). One female was pregnant with 4 embryos (30 May). Following Nicolas et al. (2008), our specimens belong to their clade IV, covering West Africa from Guinea to Ghana. All individuals were captured in microhabitat with an average of 6.4% canopy cover.

Malacomys edwardsi (Rochebrunne, 1885) Edward's Swamp Rat

One male was caught on a steep hill in gallery forest at B1 and one pregnant female with two embryos in young forest near the Seli River at B6. Both individuals were captured in microhabitat with an average of 93.5% canopy cover.

Mastomys erythroleucus (Temminck, 1853) Multimammate Mouse

Seven specimens of this common rodent were captured at all study sites except for B1 and B9. Two males were captured at B2 in a rice patch near a palm oil cooking site, one male at B3 in elephant grass savannah, three (two females, one unspecified) at B6 in grassland in a marshy area near the shore of the Seli River and one male at B5. Our specimens belong to the West African phylogroup A (Brouat et al. 2009) and were captured in microhabitat with an average of 1.7% canopy cover.

Mus musculoides (Temminck, 1853) / M. minutoides (Smith, 1834) Pigmy Mice

One male belonging to this species complex was captured at B2. It is distinguished from M. setulosus based on its small size. This tiny mouse was captured in microhabitat with 40.0% canopy cover.

Mus setulosus (Peters, 1876) Peter's Pygmy Mouse

One male of this relatively large pygmy mouse species was captured at B1 in riparian forest and three males at B9 in elephant grass and shrubs. All individuals were captured in microhabitat with an average of 25.0% canopy cover.

Praomys rostratus (Miller, 1900) West African Soft-furred Mouse

We captured 71 individuals (21 male, 36 female, 14 unspecified) of this common forest rat. It was the most common rodent species recorded in our study and captured at almost all study sites (B1, B2, B3, B6, B9), almost exclusively in forest habitats. Seven females were pregnant (one with two embryos, 24 May; two with three embryos, 23 + 27 May). The microhabitat of 68 captured individuals had an average of 73.4% canopy cover.

Family Sciuridae

Paraxerus poensis (Smith, 1834) Green Bush Squirrel

One individual was photographed on 3 June by ornithologist Paul Robinson at B3. This squirrel is common in forest edge, secondary forest and farmbush habitats. It is widely distributed in the Upper Guinean Forests of West Africa to the River Volta and in the Lower Guinean Forests from the Niger River eastwards into Central Africa (Emmons 2013).

Euxerus erythropus (Geoffroy, 1803) Striped Ground Squirrel

Observed but not photographed crossing the road at S3 on 20 May.
