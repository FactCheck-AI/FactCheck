There are two ways to watch this movie: 1. It's a cheap ALIEN rip-off in a cave (but the cave is on another planet) 2. INSEMINOID is a postcolonial and deconstructive take on British imperialism. The "settlers" are actually the invaders, but instead of raping and killing the indigenous population, the British actually get raped, impregnated and brutally murdered. 3. It's a film about a pregnant lady running amok and giving birth to alien twins (tasteful nude scenes included of course).

It was not bad but it was not amazing. It had the same style as Alien (1979) but without the production value. This was nothing more than a b-movie. Alien did it right with aspirations and credibility. Inseminoid was just about making a film. It is not amazing and the budget is low. This would benefit from more gore. There is tension and it is interesting but it just doesn't feel original at all. Fine entertainment but nothing special. The twins were cool though.

At first I didnt think this was any good, but then i watched it again and i thought that it has a cool thing going on, its not for everyone tho
