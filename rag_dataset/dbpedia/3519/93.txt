Florence Grant plays Nancy Tilton. She moves to Chicago for a job as a stenographer and is pursued by Barry Norton and loved chastely by Ralph Forbes. Complications ensue when it turns out she has the same last name as prominent Chicagoans and people keep telling her her grandmother is coming home from Europe.

It's acted in a low-key manner, which might be interesting, except it isn't, and Muriel Evans speaks in an annoying, baby-girl voice. It's a pure Poverty Row production, and the interesting talent, including Franklin Pangborn and Marry Carr are used to no particular effect. Skip this one.
