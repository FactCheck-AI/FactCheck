A sample of a cover song by Dari

"ECHO", Crusher-P

Dari is a Spanish YouTube singer.

Dari sings covers of Vocaloid, anime, or any other kind of songs (mostly powerful, energetic songs). He usually sings in Japanese or English, and he hates to sing in Spanish (his native tongue). He also mixes his own covers.

He's known for his speed in covering new release songs. Though he has a deep and mid-low voice, he enjoys singing high pitch songs.

He is good friends with Raku, and they often collab together. After a five year break of not uploading, he came back with a cover featuring his sister.
