Introduction to Windows Server 2003

Objectives • Differentiate between the different editions of Windows Server 2003 • Explain Windows Server 2003 network models and server roles • Identify concepts relating to Windows Server 2003 network management and maintenance • Explain Windows Server 2003 Active Directory concepts

Windows Server 2003 Network Administration Goals • To ensure that network resources such as files, folders, and printers are available to users • To secure the network so that available resources are only accessible to users who have been granted the proper permissions

Windows Server 2003 Editions • Multiple versions of Windows Server 2003 exist • Each version is defined to meet the need of a certain market segment • Versions Include: • Standard Edition • Enterprise Edition • Datacenter Edition • Web Edition

Standard Edition • Designed for everyday needs of small to mediumbusinesses or as a departmental server for larger organizations • Provides file and print services, secure Internet connectivity, centralized management of network resources • Logical upgrade path for Windows 2000 Server • Can be used as a domain controller, member server, or standalone server

Standard Edition (continued)

Enterprise Edition • Generally used for medium to large businesses • Designed for organizations that require better performance, reliability, and availability than Standard Edition provides • Provides support for mission-critical applications • Available in both 32 and 64-bit editions

Enterprise Edition (continued)

Enterprise Edition (continued)

Datacenter Edition • Designed for mission-critical applications, very large databases, and information access that requires the highest levels of availability • Can only be obtained from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

Datacenter Edition Continued

Web Edition • Lower-cost edition • Designed for hosting and deploying Web services and applications • Meant for small to large companies or departments that develop and/or deploy Web services • Can only be obtained from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

Web Edition (continued)

Four Types of Servers

Windows Networking Concepts Overview • Two different security models used in Windows environments • Workgroup • Domain • Three roles for a Windows Server 2003 system in a network • Standalone server • Member server • Domain controller

Workgroups • A workgroup is a logical group of computers • Characterized by a decentralized security and and administration model • Authentication provided by a local account database – Security Accounts Manager (SAM) • Limitations • Users need unique accounts on each workstation • Users manage their own accounts (security issues) • Not very scalable

Domains • A domain is a logical group of computers • Characterized by centralized authentication and administration • Authentication provided through centralized Active Directory • Active Directory database can be physically distributed across domain controllers • Requires at least one system configured as a domain controller

Member Servers • A member server • Has an account in a domain • Is notconfigured as a domain controller • Typically used for file, print, application, and host network services • All 4 Windows Server 2003 Editions can be configured as member servers

AD Improvements • Forest to Forest Trusts • Not transitive • Separate Global Catalogs (GC) • Elimination of DC piling on when a PDC is upgraded • Max Number of Object 1,000,000,000 • Site replication improved • Application Partitions – selective replication • Domains can be renamed • rendom.exe

Remote Administration Upgrades • Remote Desktop Protocol • Remote Assistance • Remote Desktop Support • Access to local devices • Web Based Remote Control

Command Line Heaven • More command line programs • Enables easier scripting and scheduling of administrative functions • More tools available via telnet

Tightened Security • Optional services turned off by default • NTFS • Everyone Group permissions • Trustworthy Computing Initiative

Domain Controllers • Explicitly configured to store a copy of Active Directory • Service user authentication requests • Service queries about domain objects • May be a dedicated server but is not required to be

Domain Controllers (continued)

Computer Accounts • Assigned in Windows NT, 2000, XP, and 2003 • Assigned when joining a domain • Method for authentication and access auditing • Accounts are represented as computer objects • Accounts can be viewed using administrative tools • e.g., Active Directory Users and Computers

Using Active Directory Users and Computers to View a Computer Object

Network Management and Maintenance Overview • Five major focus areas of administrative tasks • Managing and maintaining physical and logical devices • Managing users, computers, and groups • Managing and maintaining access to resources • Managing and maintaining a server environment • Managing and implementing disaster recovery

Managing and Maintaining Physical and Logical Devices • Network administrator responsibilities include: • Installing and configuring hardware devices • Managing server disks • Monitoring and managing performance • Tools include • Control panel applets • Device Manager • Disk Defragmenter

Managing Users, Computers, and Groups • User accounts • Creation, maintenance, passwords • Group accounts • Assign network rights and permissions to multiple users • Support e-mail distribution lists • Computer accounts • Active Directory tools and utilities used to create and maintain computer accounts

Managing and Maintaining Access to Resources • Server 2003 uses sharing technique • Sharing setup • Through Windows Explorer interface and Computer Management administrative tool • Shared folder and NTFS permissions • Terminal services • Allows access to applications through a central server • Allows access from desktops running different operating systems
