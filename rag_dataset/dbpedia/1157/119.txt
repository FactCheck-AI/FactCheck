The purpose of this chapter is to add to the discussion of the record album cover as a visual representation to be studied as an opening to explore the possibilities of critical self-understanding and aesthetic understandings which lead to critical understandings of the world and the consequent agency for the possibilities of political transformation. The major goal of studying the cover of the album Déjà vu by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (1970) is to develop and elaborate ways in which this type of record album study can lead to these types of understandings.
