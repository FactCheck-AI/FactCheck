Sometimes an historical event of a person who shares the same surnames as our ancestors, can lead one to ask, “Was he in my Family Lineage?”

Such was the case with an explorer Philip Carteret. From Wikipedia his story can be told, however it comes very short on his family history.

Philip Carteret, Seigneur of Trinity (22 January 1733, Trinity Manor, Jersey – 21 July 1796, Southampton) was a British naval officer and explorer who participated in two of the Royal Navy's circumnavigation expeditions in 1764–66 and 1766–69.

Biography

Carteret entered the navy in 1747, serving aboard the Salisbury, and then under Captain John Byron from 1751 to 1755. Between 1757 and 1758 he was in the Guernsey on the Mediterranean Station. As a lieutenant in the Dolphin he accompanied Byron during his voyage of circumnavigation, from June 1764 to May 1766.

In 1766 he was made a commander and given the command of HMS Swallow to circumnavigate the world, as consort to the Dolphin under the command of Samuel Wallis. The two ships were parted shortly after sailing through the Strait of Magellan, Carteret discovering Pitcairn Island and the Carteret Islands, which were subsequently named after him. In 1767, he also discovered a new archipelago inside Saint George's Channel between New Ireland and New Britain Islands (Papua New Guinea) and named it Duke of York Islands, as well as rediscovered the Solomon Islands first sighted by the Spaniard Álvaro de Mendaña in 1568, and the Juan Fernández Islands first discovered by Juan Fernández in 1574. Weakened by severe illness, he arrived back in England, at Spithead, on 20 March 1769, having been ably assisted by Lieutenant Erasmus Gower who was, for much of the voyage, the only fit person on board Swallow who could navigate.

The following year he returned to Jersey as seigneur of Trinity and took part in Jersey politics. He was promoted to post captain in 1771 and was in London on 5 May 1772, when he married Mary Rachel Silvester (1741–1815), a doctor's daughter. Four of their five children survived to adulthood, including:

·the second son, Philip Carteret Silvester (1777–1828), entered the navy like his father and inherited a baronetcy from his maternal uncle Sir John Silvester

·a daughter, Elizabeth Mary (1774 – 21 September 1851, Yarmouth), in 1818 became the third wife of William Symonds, Surveyor of the Navy.

Carteret's health was ruined by his voyage of exploration, and he received little reward from the Admiralty. He did not have the patrons which were necessary for naval promotion at this time, and this and his complaints before the voyage on the Swallow's ill-suitedness to the voyage ensured that his requests for a new ship in 1769 fell on deaf ears. Put on half-pay, the petition for increasing half-pay which he got together helped many officers, but not Carteret himself.

In the meantime, in 1773, his journals of the voyage were published as part of An Account of the Voyages undertaken by Byron, Wallis, Carteret and Cook, but that volume's editor John Hawkesworth made many changes to his account and so Carteret drafted a correct version of his own (which, however, only got published in 1965, by the Hakluyt Society.

His new ship, HMS Endymion, at last came on 1 August 1779 and despite problems in the Channel, off Senegal and off the Leeward Islands (at the last of which Carteret was nearly killed in a hurricane) he arrived in the West Indies as instructed. Despite having a share in four prize ships, he was paid off and the Endymion transferred to another captain. All his petitions for a new ship were unsuccessful and he suffered a stroke in 1792, retiring to Southampton in 1794 with the rank of rear admiral. He died there two years later and was buried in the catacombs of All Saints' Church, Southampton. In 1940 the church was destroyed by German bombing. In 1944 the bodies beneath it were reburied in Hollybrook Cemetery in Southampton.

Without a doubt the de Carteret family history is quite incredible, and very interwoven with other families who resided in Jersey.

The de Carteret family can be linked to the Companions of William the Conquerer. They lived in France, and were part of his crusade.

The de Carteret family was perhaps the greatest of the patrician families of the Channel Islands. There influence on the Island would last from the 10th century until the present time.

The family originated from Normandy where their ancestor Guy de Carteret would be the first Lord of the Barony of Carteret in Normandy. The family would side with William the Conqueror in the Norman conquest. Years later Renaud de Carteret I would return from First Crusade and take the parish of St Ouen by force, establishing the families presence in the Channel Islands.

A descendant of Renaud de Carteret I named Hellier de Carteret colonised the island of Sark and would become the first of the Seigneurs of Sark. At the time of the restoration, some became Barons Carteret and were granted lands in the Carolinas and in what eventually became the state of New Jersey. Others Carterets would become the Earls of Granville.

Their ancestral seat is Saint Ouen's Manor, Jersey, still today owned by persons of that name.

Philip de Carteret was the son of Charles de Carteret 1684 and Frances Mary St Paul c 1701

Charles was the son of Charles de Carteret 1669 – 1712 and Elizabeth le Couteur 1667 – 1698

This Charles had a sister Dame Elizabeth de Carteret 1663 – 1717 who married her cousin, Sir Phillip de Carteret 1650 – 1693. They also had a son called Sir Charles de Carteret 1679 – 1715. He had no heirs, and this line then died out. They have memorials in Westminster Abbey.

Biography

It was hardly surprising that a history of the Carteret family, published in 1756 in celebration of the Whig politician Earl Granville, the former Lord Carteret, should quietly omit details of the life and career of his distant relative Sir Charles Carteret, an authentic Jacobite who had spent his later years in the service of the Stuart court-in-exile. The Carterets (also known as the de Carterets) were a leading Jersey family who had been prominent in the government of the island since the Middle Ages. Sir Charles’s immediate forebears were of Trinity Manor, a junior branch of the de Carterets of St. Ouen, Jersey on whom a baronetcy had been bestowed in 1670.

The two families became more closely linked in 1676 through the marriage of Sir Philip, 2nd Bt., with Sir Charles’s sister. Carteret’s father, a Royalist during the Civil War, shared Charles II’s exile, served as Black Rod from 1676 until his death six years later, and although non-resident bailiff of Jersey was placed by James II in charge of the island’s defence as major of the militia there.

Carteret himself served in a troop of horse against Monmouth’s rebellion and was later promoted to one of the regiments of guards. His early years were spent at the palace of Whitehall, where his father had lodgings and he was in high favour with James II. In 1687 he married Mary Anne Fairfax, a maid of honour to Mary of Modena, and a granddaughter of the 2nd Viscount Fairfax.

The King gave a marriage portion of £2,000 and it is possible that Carteret converted, at least temporarily, to Catholicism in line with his wife’s faith. On receipt of his knighthood in October he was excused the usual fees. Carteret had already inherited the manor of Toomer, near Milborne Port, which his father had purchased in 1679. In December 1687, before he had come of age, the King’s agents reported that he had ‘the best interest of anyone’ at Milborne Port and added in September 1688 that not only would he be elected but he had influence enough to carry the second seat. He supported the King after the Dutch invasion and he and four servants were given a pass on 16 Nov. to visit King James at Salisbury. Though he did not stand for election to the Convention, he was making interest in the borough in July 1689, planning to stand jointly with Sir Thomas Travell*, a Whig merchant.

In 1690, aged only 23, he was returned unopposed for the borough, and was classed by Lord Carmarthen (Sir Thomas Osborne†) as a Tory and in another list as a Court supporter. His attendance during the first session was foreshortened by a grant of leave on 21 Apr. In December Carmarthen saw him as a likely Court supporter, but in April 1691 he was noted by Robert Harley* as a Country supporter. There is no evidence, however, of any noteworthy involvement in parliamentary business.

Returned in 1695, Carteret became more active in 1696, most notably as a teller. His political conduct in the House was consistently against the government. In January 1696 he was forecast as likely to oppose the Court over the proposed council of trade, and at the end of February was among the Tories who initially refused to sign the Association. However, he soon afterwards asked the pardon of the House and signed. In March he voted against fixing the price of guineas at 22s. In the next session he played an active part in the defence of Sir John Fenwick†, acting as teller on 6 Nov. with John Granville against authorizing the bill of attainder, and at the bill’s third reading on the 25th he outlined his belief that the case was insufficiently proven. He also voted against the bill in the closing division. Two days later he was teller in favour of a motion that the ‘grievances of the kingdom’, rather than the ‘state of the nation’, should be considered by a committee of the whole. On 23 Nov. he had been teller in favour of giving a second reading to the bill for improving the regulation of elections. In July 1697 it was brought to the attention of the lords justices that Carteret’s wife had been going about the streets of London in disguise distributing printed ‘libels’ sent from France, and orders were issued to the Post Office to intercept her letters. Returned again in 1698, Carteret was listed as a Country supporter, appeared in the forecast of those likely to oppose the standing army, and on 18 Jan. 1699 was one of the tellers (again with Granville) in favour of the disbanding bill. On 15 Mar. he conveyed a private naturalization bill to the Lords.

He was given three weeks’ leave of absence on 16 Dec., and was teller on 10 Apr. 1700 against adjourning the debate on an address for the removal of Lord Chancellor Somers (Sir John*) from the King’s presence and councils.

Carteret did not stand at the first general election of 1701 but instead left England for the Stuart court at St. Germain where, in November 1701, he was appointed gentleman usher of the Black Rod, the office his father had previously held under Charles II. He continued to serve the Old Pretender in this capacity until his death in July 1719 when he was buried at St. Germain-en-Laye in the presence of his son James and William Dicconson, treasurer to the Stuart Court.

Charles de Carteret 1669 was the son of Charles De Carteret 1646 – 1685 and Marie De Carteret 1641 – 1686 They were cousins.

Charles de Carteret 1646 was the son of Helier de Carteret 1574 – 1668 and Rachel la Clouche 1619 – 1686

Helier de Carteret 1574 was the son of Pierre de Carteret and Judith Dumaresq 1552 – 1646

Pierre de Carteret was the son of Francis de Carteret 1515 – 1575 and Margaret Payn 1510 – 1570

Francis de Carteret was the son of Sir Richard de Carteret 1476 – 1560 and Jeanne Dumaresq 1480 – 1570.

This lineage can be traced back to Guilliame de Carteret born in France, and part of the Norman Conquest.

De Carteret and Montague Line

A member of the Montague family also married into the de Carteret line.

Dame Jemima Montague, was a direct descendant of another of those who were involved in the Conquest.

Her line goes back to Drogo de Montagu.

Drogo de Montagu 1030 – 1090 (of Monte Acuto in Normandy) participated in the Conquest, and at the time of Domesday held lands in Somerset and Devon. Here is an entry from the Domesday Book:

Drogo of Montacute [Drogo de Montagud] holds KNOWLE (Park). Alnoth held it before 1066; it paid tax for 1 1/2 hides. Land for 3 ploughs; as many there. 6 villagers, and 4 slaves with 1 cottager.

Meadow, 15 acres; woodland 4 furlongs in length and 3 furlongs in width. 26 pigs.

Formally 40s; value now £4.

Drogo holds it from the King.

From this land 1 hide of land has been taken away which was there before 1066. Thurstan son of Rolf holds it, & an Englishman from him. Value 20s.

His brother Ansger also held lands in Somerset.

Our grandmother Aline Basset married Andreas (Drew or Drogo) Lord Montacute de Talbot 11183 – 1216. Of their sons, Sir William De Montacut married Berta of Lidworth, and their son was Simon de Montacute 1250 – 1315. His son was William de Montagu 1273 – 1319. He is our 22nd great grandfather.

Through this lineage Lady Jemima Montague is a direct relation.

Jemima was the daughter of Admiral Sir Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich 1625 – 1672 and his wife Jemima Crew 1625 – 1674. He died along with Jemima’s husband in 1672 at the Battle of Solebay

Jemima married Sir Philip Carteret 1615 – 1672 and they had 4 children. They became orphans at a young age and were brought up by their grandmother. Elizabeth de Carteret 1636 – 1696

Sir Philip Carteret, FRS (1641 – 1672), was the eldest son of Sir George Carteret and his wife and cousin Elizabeth de Cartetet.

Philip was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 15 February 1665.

He married Jemima Montagu, daughter of Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, in an arranged marriage on 31 July 1665. Samuel Pepys had a hand in the marriage and wrote of it at some length in his diary. Jemima had only known of Philip some fourteen days before their marriage: Pepys did ask her if she could like Philip as a husband, and was relieved when she answered that she thought she could like him very well. It is noted that Jemima failed to arrive in time for the ceremony at the church, but the marriage is thought to have been reasonably happy. Jemima died in childbirth in 1671.

Philip was father of four children, including George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret.

Knighted in 1667, he became Gentleman of the King's Chamber in 1670.

Philip died along with his father-in-law the Earl of Sandwich when their ship, the Prince Royal, was grappeled by a Dutch fire ship in the Battle of Solebay.

Their children were Edward Carteret who married Bridget Exton, George Carteret, who married Grace Granville, Phillipe de Carteret, Mary and Mary Ann.

Edward’s son was George Carteret. He is buried in Westminster Abbey

George Carteret

On 21st November 1699 Edward Carteret, 3rd son of Sir Philip (who was killed at the battle of Sole Bay in 1672) and his wife Lady Jemima Montagu daughter of the 1st Earl of Sandwich, married Lady Bridget Sudbury, alias Clutterbuck, daughter of Sir Thomas Exton, in the Abbey. Their eldest son George Carteret was buried in the nave on 14th November 1718. He died aged 17 while attending Westminster School.

Their son was George de Carteret 1667 – 1695 married Grace Granville. Their son was

John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 7th Seigneur of Sark, KG, PC (/kɑːrtəˈrɛt/; 22 April 1690 – 2 January 1763), commonly known by his earlier title Lord Carteret, was a British statesman and Lord President of the Council from 1751 to 1763; he worked extremely closely with the Prime Minister of the country, Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, in order to manage the various factions of the Government. He was Seigneur of Sark from 1715 to 1720 when he sold the fief. He held (in absentia) the office of Bailiff of Jersey from 1715 to 1763.

John Carteret was educated at Westminster School, and at Christ Church, Oxford. Jonathan Swift said that "with a singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more Greek, Latin and philosophy than properly became a person of his rank". Throughout his life Carteret not only showed a keen love of the classics, but a taste for and knowledge of modern languages and literature. He was almost the only English nobleman of his time who spoke German, which allowed him to talk with and gain the trust of[4] King George I, who spoke no English. Walter Harte, the author of the Life of Gustavus Adolphus, acknowledged the aid which Carteret had given him.

On 17 October 1710 Carteret married Lady Frances Worsley at Longleat House. She was the granddaughter of the first Viscount Weymouth. One of their daughters, Georgiana Caroline Carteret Spencer, became the grandmother of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.

Upon reaching his majority of 21, Lord Carteret took his seat in the House of Lords on 25 May 1711. Although his family, on both sides, had been devoted to the Jacobite cause, Carteret was a steady adherent of the Hanoverian dynasty which supplanted them. He was a friend of the Whig leaders Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland and supported the passing of the Septennial Act

On 18 October 1744 Carteret became 2nd Earl Granville on the death of his mother. His first wife Lady Frances Worsley died on 20 June 1743 at Hanover, and in April 1744 he married Lady Sophia Fermor, a daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret, a fashionable beauty and "reigning toast" of London society, who was younger than his daughters. Granville's ostentatious performance of the part of lover was ridiculed by Horace Walpole as "The nuptials of our great Quixote and the fair Sophia"[6] and "My lord stayed with her there till four in the morning. They are all fondness—walk together, and stop every five steps to kiss."

The Countess Granville died on 7 October 1745, leaving one daughter Sophia Carteret, who married William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. Granville's second marriage may have done something to increase his reputation for eccentricity. In February 1746 he allowed himself to be entrapped by the intrigues of the Pelhams into accepting the secretaryship, but resigned within forty-eight hours. In June 1751 he became president of the council, and was still liked and trusted by the King, but his share in government did not go beyond giving advice, and endeavouring to forward ministerial arrangements. In 1756 he was asked by Newcastle to become Prime Minister as the alternative to Pitt, but having perfectly understood why the offer was made, declined and supported Pitt. When in October 1761 Pitt, who had information of the signing of the "Family Compact" wished to declare war on Spain, and declared his intention to resign unless his advice was accepted, Granville replied that "the opinion of the majority (of the Cabinet) must decide". He spoke in complimentary terms of Pitt but resisted his claim to be considered as a "sole minister" or Prime Minister.

Whether he used the words attributed to him in the Annual Register for 1761 is more than doubtful, but the minutes of Council show that they express his meaning

Philip was the son of Sir George Carteret 1610 – 1680, Elizabeth was the daughter of Phillip de Carteret 1584 – 1643 and Anne Dowse 1597 – 1644.

George Carteret's signature

Sir George Carteret (1610–1680) was Bailiff of Jersey when King Charles I was executed and had his son Charles II proclaimed King in Jersey. He had been a naval officer and was later to serve as Treasurer of the Navy. He was given large tracts of land in the American colonies by Charles II, who named New Jersey in his honour.

Family

He was the son of Helier de Carteret and Elizabeth Dumaresq of Jersey, who both died in 1640. George dropped the "de" from his surname when he entered the English navy, concerned that the "de" sounded too French). In the Chapel of Mont Orgueil Castle in May 1640 George married his cousin Elizabeth de Carteret, daughter of Philippe de Carteret, 3rd Seigneur of Sark.

Sir George Carteret

He served as an officer in various naval ships in the 1630s but when the Civil War started he retired from the navy, and withdrew with his family to Jersey.

He subsequently returned to aid the projects of the royalists but then went back to Jersey to succeeded his uncle as Bailiff, holding the office for eight years. After subduing the Parliamentary party in the island, he was commissioned (1644) a vice-admiral of Jersey and "the maritime parts adjacent", and by virtue of that office he carried on an active privateering campaign in the Royalist cause. Parliament branded him as a pirate and excluded him specifically from future amnesty. His rule in Jersey was severe, but profitable to the island; he developed its resources and made it a refuge for Royalists, among whom in 1646 and again in 1649-1650 was Prince Charles, who created Carteret a knight and baronet.

George Carteret also had Charles proclaimed King in Saint Helier on 17 February 1649, after the execution of his father, Charles I. Charles II never forgot that Jersey became the first of his realms to recognise his claim to the throne.

Elizabeth Carteret

Privateering resumes

After his proclamation in Jersey Charles rewarded de Carteret by ordering that his privateering could resume. He sent Carteret a bundle of Letters of Marque, signed by himself in ink, with a blank for the names of the captain and boat left for Carteret to fill in, and soon once more, Jersey privateers were making the Channel dangerous for ships flying Cromwell’s flag

Know that we, reposing trust and confidence in your courage, experience in sea affairs, a good affection to Us, do by these presents nominate and appoint you Captain of the good ship ………………………, giving you authority with your ship manned, equipped, and armed for war, to enter any River or Port of England, and, either there or at sea, to apprehend and possess, and in the case of resistance to sink, fire, or otherwise destroy, all ships together with their men, goods, and lading, belonging to any place or person of our subjects in actual rebellion against, or not in present obedience to Us, together with the ships, persons, and goods, of all their aiders and abettors.

And to bring all ships, persons and merchandize as you shall take, without breaking the bulk or altering the property of any of the said goods, to our Island of Jersey, there to cause the same to be adjudged lawful prize by such Judge of the Admiralty as is settled there, and after such adjudication to pay the tenths and fifteenths to Our use to such person as shall have authority to receive the same.

Provided that you do not permit any injury to be done to any ships belonging to subjects of any Prince or State in league or amity with Us,

And that you make the Isle of Jersey the constant place of your abode, and obey the orders of the Governor there, whilst you enjoy the benefits our this Our commission,

Provided that you enter into bond of one thousand pounds sterling to Us for the performance of all these particulars.

CHARLES R

Sir George's son Philip, who predeceased him at the age of 30 in 1672

In addition to this naval win for Carteret, he received a highly unexpected prize. The execution of King Charles I caused considerable discontent within the Navy. One of their frigates, the “Heart” changed sides and, to the surprise of all, arrived at Jersey. Carteret, not one to miss an opportunity, took advantage of the fact that nobody knew this change of loyalties had occurred. He sent the Heart off to Guernsey to capture another ship, the “Secant”. The crew of the Secant, unknowing that the Heart had pledged their loyalty to the King, was an easy target and the captured ship and its prizes went to Jersey. An unusual characteristic of Carteret is revealed here. Although he did “imprison the Jerseymen and Guernseymen on board, he sent the others to St. Malo and gave each of them a piece of eight so that they might be able to pay their expenses in getting back to England”

Surrender

Carteret had to surrender Jersey to the Commonwealth on 12 December 1651 after an invasion by parliamentarian troops. He then went into exile in France. Although he had command of a French naval vessel for some time, he was imprisoned in 1657 and then exiled from France, after which he went to Venice.

Restoration

At the Restoration, having shared Charles II’s banishment, Sir George formed one of the immediate train of the restored monarch on his triumphant entry into London. The next day Carteret was sworn into the Privy Council, appointed Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, and Treasurer of the Navy. His career for the next decade is documented in the diary of Samuel Pepys who joined him as Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board in 1660. In 1667 he exchanged his office as Vice-Chamberlain with Lord Anglesey for that of Vice-Treasurer of Ireland, an office which he sold two years later for £11000.

Duce in Normandy where Carteret took refuge during the Commonwealth occupation of Jersey

American colonies

The fidelity with which Carteret, like John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, had clung to the royal cause, gave him great influence at court. He had, at an early date, taken a warm interest in the colonization of America. In recognition for all the help given to him during his exile in Jersey in the 1640s, Charles II gave Carteret a large grant of land in the American colonies, which he named New Jersey. With Berkeley, he became one of the proprietors of the Province of Carolina, prior to their becoming jointly interested in East Jersey. Carteret County, North Carolina and the town of Carteret, New Jersey are named after him.

In 1665, Carteret was one of the drafters of the Concession and Agreement, a document that provided freedom of religion in the colony of New Jersey. It was issued as a proclamation for the structure of the government for the colony written by the two proprietors, Berkeley and Carteret.

Later life

He was elected in 1661 to represent Portsmouth in Parliament but his lax methods of keeping accounts led to his being censured by parliament, having initially been accused of embezzlement. After an announcement from the king expressing his satisfaction with Carteret and an acquittal by the House of Lords, the inquiry against him lapsed.

In 1673, he was appointed one of the Lords of the Admiralty, and continued in the public service until his death on 14 January 1680.

Shortly before Carteret's death, the king proposed to give him the title Baron Carteret, but Carteret died too soon, so the honour was granted to his grandson George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret.

Other Family Members of Interest

Seigneur of St Ouen and of Longueville, who was Bailiff of Jersey, as appears by Rolls of the Royal Court, in 1446. He was succeeded by his son, Renaud.

Seigneur of St Ouen, who at the time of his father's death was a minor in ward of the King. His guardianship was granted to Roger de Walden, Rector of Drayton, Leicester, "he paying into the Exchequer ten pounds per annum, for which the said Roger gave security". This Sir Philippe inherited all the military talents of his ancestors, and was one of the principal instruments in rescuing the island after a period of French occupation.

Sir Philippe married the sole daughter and heiress of Sir William Newton, of of Gloucestershire, by whom he had a son Philippe, who married Perrine, daughter of Penna de Caux, of the Pays of Caux in Normandy, and had a son, another Philippe.

Although not quite as dramatic as his grandfather's seige of Mont Orgueil, this Philippe de Carteret was involved in another dramatic saga which involved his wife rushing to the Court of Henry VII in London to persuade him to bring to a halt a duel in which Philippe might have lost his life.

Sir Edouard de Carteret - 1

From A Biographical Dictionary of Jersey by George Balleine

Sir Edouard de Carteret (1620-1683)was Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod and Bailiff of Jersey.

He was the younger son of Lieut-Bailiff Josue De Carteret and Jeanne Herault daughter of Edouard, Rector of St Clement. He was born in Trinity Manor on 17 February 1620.

Civil War

During the Civil War in June 1649 he went with Sir George Carteret to Paris to arrange for the King's visit to Jersey. He was one of the defenders of Elizabeth Castle when it surrendered in 1651. He then shared the King's exile.

The Patent appointing him Bailiff states:

”He has constantly served and followed our person in foreign landss".

This meant nine years aimless drifting from Paris to Colognee, Bruges, Brussels, Brittany, the Spanish frontier, back again to Brussels. In August 1654 he is mentioned as one of the members of the King's Household who were to receive board wages out of the 72,000 guilders allowed by the King of France. At the Restoration in 1660 he obtained a position at Court. In 1665 he is described as “Knight, one of our Gentlemen Ushers in Ordinary and Daily Waiter".

On 25 November 1665 he was sworn in as Bailiff, the first of six non-resident De Carteret Bailiffs, whose English engagements left little time for their Jersey duties. Under them the office of Lieut-Bailiff assumed a new importance, for Lieut-Bailiffss now performed all the Bailiff's functions.

Sir Edouard's Lieutenants were Jean Pipon, Jean Poingdestre then Philippe Le Geyt. For eleven years (1668-79) Sir Edouard did not once preside over the States. In 1675 he is mentioned as Keeper of the Little Park, Windsor. In 1676 he became Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod, a title derived from his ebony staff surmounted by a gold lion. His duty now was to attend the King, when he went to the House of Lords, to maintain order in the House, and arrest recalcitrant peers, and to summon the Commons to hear the King's speech and his assent to their bills. Moreover, as Usher to the Order of the Garter, he had to keep the door at all meetings of the Chapter.

In 1679 a constitutional crisis brought him back to Jersey. When appointed Bailiff in 1665, one of his first acts had been to call the King's attention to the danger of a French invasion. In response Sir Thomas Morgan had been sent as Governor, a fine soldier, but a testy old martinet with no respect whatever for civil officials. He told the Attorney-General that he "had been like to lay him by the heels", and during a sitting of the Court he threatened the Constable of St Martin with his cane, shouting: "By God, Sirrah, I shall rub your nose".

Petition to King

After much friction the States at last petitioned the King against him and in July 1679 secured an Order in Council granting all that they asked for, and stating that "no Governor shall disturb the inhabitants in the peaceable possession of their privileges".

But Morgan had died in April. The new Governor,Sir John Lanier, who owed his appointment largely to de Carteret's influence at Court, protested that this Order would "much impayre the authoritie of the Governor", and secured its suspension till the States should produce a list of their privileges for his consideration. De Carteret realized that this required his personal attention. He spent the next nine months in Jersey. A new deputation was sent to the Council, but it could not prevent a revision of the Order, much in Lanier's favour.

Sir Edouard was still Bailiff in March 1682, when he protested successfully before the Council against the stopping of work on St Aubin pier, but later in the year he resigned in favour of his son-in-law, Sir Philippe De Carteret of St Ouen, the husband of his daughter Elizabeth. On 18 February 1683 he died while on a visit to St Ouen's Manor.

The St Lawrence Church Register declares:

"He was buried with the pomp and splendour that his dignity deserved".

Tradition says that all arrangements had been made to bury him in St. Ouen's Church, but, as the procession was about to start, a terrific thunderstorm frightened the six horses that drew the hearse, and they could not be reined in, till they stopped of their own accord at the gate of Trinity Church. The mourners who had followed this mad stampede took this as a sign that he wished to be buried in his native parish.

The coffin was taken to the Manor, while a new grave was dug beside his family pew, and the funeral was finished by torch-light. We have found no contemporary evidence for the bolting horses, but it is a fact that he was buried in Trinity Church, where the finest mural monument in the island proclaims in Latin that "no juster man ever lived on earth or one more loving to a friend".

He married Elizabeth, daughter of Robert Johnson, Alderman of London, and had three children, Elizabeth, born 30 December 1663, and baptized in St Martin-in-the-fields, who married Sir Philippe De Carteret, Charles, and Edward, born 1665, who died when seven years old, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

Philip De Carteret (died 1500) was the eighth Seigneur of Saint Ouen. The son of Philip, he married Margaret Harliston in 1470 and had 21 children.

According to a biased non-contemporary account of Baker's governorship, Philip De Carteret opposed the alleged cruelty of the rule of Matthew Baker as Governor of Jersey, who had been appointed with vice-regal Powers in all but name. It was alleged that Baker conceived a plot to implicate De Carteret as a traitor, using a letter purportedly written by De Carteret to the Normans. De Carteret was imprisoned in Mont Orgueil to await trial by combat. According to a chronicle of events, - written by a member of the De Carteret family some 70 years later - his wife Margaret, who had only recently given birth, secretly took a boat to the English mainland to convince King Henry VII of her husband's innocence. He was freed and his lands and chattels returned to him, and Baker was later recalled from office. Henry VII was not absolutely convinced of De Carteret's loyalty, however, and placed him under a Bond of £1,000 as surety for his future good conduct.
