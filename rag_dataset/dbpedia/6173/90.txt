PORTLAND, Ore. and HOLLYWOOD, Calif., Dec. 15 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Rentrak Corporation (Nasdaq: RENT), a leader in multi-screen media measurement serving the entertainment and advertising industries, and The Nielsen Company, today announced that the companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Rentrak will acquire Nielsen EDI, a global leader in measurement, information and research solutions for the motion picture industry from The Nielsen Company. The transaction, which is expected to close in the first calendar quarter of 2010, is subject, in some jurisdictions, to consultation with employee representative bodies and other regulatory requirements. As part of the transaction, Nielsen will also enter into a long term data license agreement with Rentrak for continued access to certain box office sales information for certain of its existing products and services that currently use or feature such data.

Nielsen EDI, which will be integrated into Rentrak's AMI division and its Box Office Essentials(TM) business, captures theatrical box office results from more than 50,000 movie screens in 14 countries. The combination will provide box office results for the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Russia, Spain and the United Kingdom, covering 90% of the global theatrical box office market.

"This strategic transaction will provide Rentrak with a substantial global platform, further enabling our ability to provide robust measurement capabilities and analytics to entertainment, media and advertising companies throughout the world, and from which to pursue new business opportunities," said Bill Livek, Rentrak's Chief Executive Officer.

"While EDI has been an important part of the Nielsen portfolio, this transaction allows our entertainment group to focus on its core businesses and those parts of the company that are most aligned with our long-term strategy. Nielsen remains committed to increasing its understanding of the connected consumer, with a special focus on the relationship between media consumption and consumer purchase behavior," said Eric Weinberg, President, Nielsen Entertainment.

"Overseas box office continues to be a major contributor to movie receipts and is an important facet of our strategy to solidify Rentrak's position as the 'gold standard' for worldwide, real-time measurement of theatrical box office ticket sales," added Ron Giambra, Rentrak's Executive Vice President, Theatrical Worldwide. "With the encouragement of our studio partners, our strategic geographic expansion will provide a truly unified view of the global motion picture consumer."
