Kathmandu is believed to have been established in 723 by Raja Gunakamadeva, it was initially known as Manju-Patan.

Its current name derives from a wooden temple (kath, meaning “wood”; mandir, meaning “temple” or “edifice”) believed to have been constructed entirely from the wood of a single tree in 1596, by Raja Lachmina Singh.

A structure, thought to be the original establishment, still lies in the central square and is now used as a lodging place for holy men.
