DESCRIPTION:

(from CBS's press release, December 2013) After 208 episodes told over nine seasons, the story of how Ted Mosby ultimately meets his children's mother will conclude with a special one-hour series finale on Monday, March 31 (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT). The HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER finale will be followed immediately by the series premiere of the new comedy FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES (9:00-9:30 PM, ET/PT). Following its special premiere after the HIMYM finale, FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES moves to its regular Monday (8:30-9:00 PM, ET/PT) time period on April 7. FRIENDS WITH BETTER LIVES is about six friends at different stages in their lives - married, divorced, newly engaged and single - who are outwardly happy, but secretly questioning if their friends have it better. As part of CBS's new Monday lineup, 2 BROKE GIRLS will move to the 8:00 PM time period on April 14 to lead off the night's comedy block.
