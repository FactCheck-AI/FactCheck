Tailor-made architecture

FerrariCentro Stile is the place where the dream cars of tomorrow are imagined today. Located in Viale Enzo Ferrari, in the heart of the Ferrari factory, the building houses Maranello's design activities under a single, spectacular roof: over 100 designers and engineers, the Model shop, the Tailor Made area and the Ateliers.

This splendid building is an avant-garde "compact sculpture", arranged on four levels with a total area of 5,000 square meters. The entire structure is enclosed by a "double skin" mesh whose external fa√ßade is made up of over 3,000 triangular glass and aluminium modules. A giant prancing horse logo decorates the exterior.

Ferrari Centro Stile has been designed in cooperation with the Ferrari Design team led by Arch. Flavio Manzoni, Design International led by Arch. Davide Padoa and Planning Engineering led by Eng. Stefano Neri.

The exteriors, which evoke the dynamic lines of Ferrari sports cars, are a captivating combination of concave and convex surfaces. The external geometric panels, which alternate glass and stretched anodized aluminium, give the entire structure a floating effect.
