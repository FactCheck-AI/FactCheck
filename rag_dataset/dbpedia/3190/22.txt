Museo Ferrari

Many of the most important cars built, both racing and street cars, are exhibited here.

If you are in Maranello we would highly recommend Museo Ferrari. It is centrally located in the village. The museum has been around for a few years, and the exhibition has been expanded on several occasions. Most recently, the museum was expanded with a whole department dealing with F1 and racing. It is impressive. Many of the most important cars built, both racing and street cars, are exhibited in the same place.

Are you visiting by car? Then I recommend that you park outside the Museo Ferrari. There is a large parking lot there. After visiting the museum, you are within walking distance to both Ferrari's old factory entrance and Ferrari's large shop with gadgets.
