Let’s travel to Algeria for 22 fun facts. Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the land of the Sahara Desert and home to seven UNESCO sites.

1. Fun fact: Algeria is the largest country in Africa, and a major player in the region and world

Algeria, formally the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, is the largest country in North Africa and the tenth largest country in the world. Much of Algeria’s land is covered by the Algerian Desert, a desert in central North Africa, part of the larger Sahara Desert.

It might not surprise you that the Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert, and that Algeria is hot; the highest recorded temperature in Algeria is over 124 degrees Fahrenheit (51 degrees Celsius). What did surprise me was that Algeria isn’t one of the hottest countries in the world. The honor of country with the hottest average temperature goes to:

Burkina Faso 84.7 °F (29.3 °C)

Mali 84.6 °F (29.21 °C)

Aruba 84.5 °F (29.2 °C)

Senegal 84.0 °F (28.9 °C)

Algeria ranks as 117th hottest country 23.6 °C (74.5 °F). While not a member of the hot country club, Algeria is a member of several major international organizations, including the African Union, the Arab League, the OIC, OPEC, the United Nations, and the Arab Maghreb Union, of which it is a founding member. There are many more interesting facts about Algeria, including its diverse climate and significant historical events. Let’s get into it.

2. Arabic is the Algerian language; the Algerian identity is far more complicated to untangle

The official language of Algeria is Arabic. The Algerian population speaks Arabic, Berber (Tamazight and Amazigh), or French. While English is not commonly spoken, it is taught in Algerian schools.

Most Algerians are of Arab descent, and only a minority identify as Amazigh. The Amazigh are also Muslim but emphasize their cultural heritage over Arab cultural heritage. Some Amazigh have sought increased autonomy, sometimes peacefully, sometime not. While the Algerian government is unlikely to grant autonomy, it has officially recognized Amazigh languages and introduced these languages into public schools.

3. The capital city of Algiers is known as “The White” for its sun-bleached buildings

Algiers is the capital city of Algeria. Algiers is known as “Alger la Blanche” (Algiers the White) because of its whitewashed buildings. Situated on the Mediterranean coast, Algiers is the largest city in Algeria and features historic sites like the Casbah of Algiers, modern architecture, and a whirl of French and Arab influences.

4. Most of the country’s population is on the Mediterranean coast and in Northern Algeria

Most of the Algerian population lives on the coast. Nearly 90% of Algeria is uninhabited, with most of the land being the Sahara Desert. The Sahara Desert is the largest hot desert in the world and covers 80% of Algeria.

So despite Algeria’s size, only 12% of the population lives inland, with most people residing along the Mediterranean coast. The northern region has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and rainy winters, while the southern region is arid.

5. Algeria was an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire until France seized the capital city Algiers in 1830

Algeria was an autonomous province of the Ottoman Empire, enjoying self-governance until 1830. France launched a military campaign and seized Algiers, the capital city. The French invasion marked the beginning of a long colonial period for Algeria, as France integrated Algeria into its empire.

6. Algeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962

Algeria gained independence from France on July 5, 1962, after 132 years of colonia rule. The Algerian War of Independence against France lasted from 1954 to 1962. French historians estimate that around 400,000 Algerians perished during the conflict.

7. The Algerian national anthem is a war song against the French

The national anthem, “Qassaman” or “Kassaman,” was adopted in 1962 and reflects the theme of the Algerian fight for independence. The lyrics promote nationalistic ideals and principles on the front line, and championing armed uprising as the sole route to independence. It foreshadows a “day of reckoning” for France, Algeria’s former colonial ruler. Algeria’s national holiday, Revolution Day, honors the beginning of the final bid for independence.

8. Algerian civil war from 1992 to 2002 was pretty ugly

The Algerian Civil War broke out across the country thirty years after independence. The war was fought between the Algerian government and multiple Islamist rebel groups from January 11, 1992, to February 8, 2002, after a coup nullified an Islamist electoral victory.

The conflict started slowly, but by 1994, violence had escalated to a point where the government’s stability was in question. The war involved extreme violence against civilians. Fatalities are estimated to be between 44,000 and up to 200,000.

9. The Algerian government runs on a combination of French and Sharia law

Algeria’s legal system is a blend of the French court system and Sharia law, reflecting its colonial past and significant Muslim influence. The official religion of Algeria is Islam. Islamic symbols are on the flag and throughout the government. It is illegal to proselytize any religion other than Islam in Algeria.

Ancient Algeria was ruled by various empires and dynasties, including the Byzantines, Turks, Spanish, Romans, and Germanic tribes. The inhabitants converted to Islam when Muslim Arabs captured the region in the 7th century.

10. The Arab conquest of North Africa (Islamic Maghreb) shaped Algeria

The Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, also known as the Arab conquest of North Africa, began in 647 and ended in 709. This period saw the Byzantine Empire lose its last remaining strongholds in North Africa to the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates, particularly under Caliph Al-Walid I. These campaigns were part of the rapid early Muslim conquests that reshaped the region over a century.

11. Algeria is a natural gas superpower

Algeria is the sixth-largest exporter of natural gas and has the 10th largest natural gas reserve in the world. Fossil fuels are the main export, significantly contributing to the economy and classifying Algeria as an upper-middle-income country. In 2019, Algeria had the fifth cheapest petrol in the world at $0.35 per liter due to government subsidies.

A large percentage of the country’s earnings come from hydrocarbon exports, and Algeria has negligible external debt. However, despite significant revenue from natural gas exports, many Algerians live in absolute poverty, with one in four citizens living on less than a dollar a day.

12. Algeria is home to seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites

Algeria’s diverse climate supports various crops. The coastal region, with its Mediterranean climate, grows citrus and wheat, while the desert regions are known for date groves.

Algeria is the 10th largest producer of dates in the world, with large palm groves common in desert oasis towns. The snack of choice in Algeria is the date fruit, which is both sweet and nutritious, packed with vitamins and dietary fiber. Algeria is often called the land of cherries and dates, referring to the varied climate: a mild climate in the north and a dry, hot one in the Saharan south.

Algerian dates are renowned for their quality and flavor. Visitors to Algeria are traditionally greeted with dates and milk, showcasing the cultural importance of this fruit.

16. Algeria is a large country with lots of neighbors

Algeria is the largest country in Africa and shares borders with other nations. Algeria’s neighboring countries in Northern Africa are:

Morocco (969 miles border): Algeria and Morocco share a long tumultuous history, including the Sand War in 1963 and the Western Sahara War from 1975 to 1991. The Sand War was a border conflict between Algeria and Morocco, over Morocco’s claim to Algeria’s Tindouf and Béchar provinces in Western Algeria, close to the Mauritanian, Western Saharan and Moroccan borders. The conflict stemmed from unclear borders, valuable mineral resources, and Moroccan expansionism.

Mali (844 miles border)

Tunisia (642 miles border): Relations are friendly along the Tunisian border

Libya (614 miles border)

Niger (591 miles border): The border between Niger and Algeria is mostly desert with few crossing points. In recent years, the border region between Algeria and neighboring countries has gained attention due to increasing numbers of African migrants crossing it to reach Europe. In 2017, Algeria began stricter border policing, leading to criticism as deported migrants were left stranded at the remote frontier without provisions.

Mauritania (286 miles border): Algeria and Mauritania opened the “Martyr Mujahid Ismail Ould Bardi” border in February 2024 to facilitate the transit of people and goods between the two countries. President of Mauritania, Mohamed Ould Cheikh El Ghazouani, and the President of Algeria, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, supervised the opening of the border intended to boost trade, enhance economic cooperation, and strengthen the bonds of brotherhood, friendship, and good neighborliness. Additionally, the plan includes creating a free trade zone and building a road linking Tindouf in Algeria to Ezouirat in Mauritania.

18. Algeria faces several significant environmental issues

Ok, so this is not a fun fact about Algeria. Algeria faces several significant environmental issues. Although Algeria is not a major contributor to global climate change, poor farming practices and overgrazing lead to soil erosion and desertification. Pollution is another major problem, with rivers and coastal waters contaminated by the dumping of raw sewage, petroleum refining wastes, and other industrial effluents.

The high Atlas Mountains and broad Sahara Desert influence the climate, creating a rain shadow effect that impacts water distribution. Greenhouse gas emissions mainly come from fossil fuel operations and power generation, with the economy heavily reliant on oil and natural gas. The government is pursuing sustainable development, but today renewable energy only accounts for 3% of electricity in 2023.

20. The Algerian camel calvary was a real thing in the Sahara Desert

The Sahara Desert Algerian camel cavalry, known as the Méhariste, was a part of the French military during colonial times. These camel cavalry units were recruited from nomadic tribes and commanded by French officers. The units were tasked with patrolling the vast expanse of the Sahara Desert. During World War II, Méhariste companies fought against Axis forces.

After the war, the Méhariste resumed their role as the police force of the Sahara Desert. They were stationed near the Tunisian border until the end of French rule in Algeria in 1962, following the Algerian War of Independence. After independence, the newly formed Algerian government disbanded these camel mounted units.

Too bad the US Army doesn’t have a camel division!
