Over the past few decades, synthpop has become known as one of the most quirky and fun genres of pop music. Originating in the 1960s, synthpop bands started popping up as more new wave, Krautrock, progressive rock, and art rock bands started incorporating synthesizers into their sound; and, of course, synthpop is an offshoot of this blend. Synthesizer-based sounds caught on with audiences, and with their abundance of and reliance on electronic instruments, they only continued to create some of the most interesting new sounds across music. At the beginning of the 2000s, synthpop reemerged as a powerful genre that coincided with the electronic music boom (and it has yet to subside).

So, what are the best synthpop bands and synthpop artists of all time? Any list of synthpop groups, duos, or singers has to include the names Depeche Mode, Devo, Kraftwerk, Passion Pit and M83 on it. From older synthpop bands to the newest generation of musicians, these artists still remain some of the most recognizable bands in the genre. Between their biggest hits, studio LP sales, and sold out live shows, one could say that synthpop bands have reached their greatest popularity since the 1980s.

That said, it's up to you to vote for the top synthpop artists of the past few decades. This list answers the questions "who are the best synthpop bands of all time?" and "who is the greatest synthpop musician ever?" If you know enough about the genre, please vote based on the quality of the bands' music (albums and songs) instead of just voting for the most popular, famous, or modern synthpop musicians that you might've heard of.
