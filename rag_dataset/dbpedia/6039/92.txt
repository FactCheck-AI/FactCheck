Synth Pop

History of Synthpop

In this article, we will explore the history of synthpop, from its technological origins to its cultural impact.

Synthpop is a genre of electronic and pop music that first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the Krautrock of bands like Kraftwerk. Emerging as a distinct genre in Japan and the UK during the post-punk era, synthpop became a significant part of the new wave movement from the late 1970s to the mid-1980s.

The Dawn of Synthpop

The invention of the synthesizer was the most important technological advancement that led to the creation of synthpop. The first synthesizers were developed in the early 1950s, but they were large, expensive, and difficult to use. In the 1960s, synthesizers became more affordable and portable, and they began to be used by musicians to create new and innovative sounds.

Synthpop Synthesizers

One of the most important early synthesizers was the Moog Minimoog. The Minimoog was released in 1970, and it was one of the first mass-produced synthesizers. It was also one of the first synthesizers to be used by popular musicians. Kraftwerk was one of the first bands to use the Minimoog, and they used it to create their signature electronic sound. Other early synthpop bands that used the Minimoog include Devo, Gary Numan, and OMD.

Another important early synthesizer was the ARP Odyssey. The Odyssey was released in 1972, and it was known for its warm and organic sound. It was used by a wide variety of musicians, including synthpop bands like The Human League, Ultravox, and Depeche Mode.

Early synthesizers were also used to create new and innovative drum sounds. The Roland TR-808 drum machine was released in 1980, and it quickly became the standard drum machine for synthpop bands. The TR-808 was used by bands like The Human League, OMD, and Depeche Mode to create their signature electronic beats.

Early synthesizers and drum machines were used by musicians to create a wide range of new and innovative sounds. These sounds were central to the development of synthpop in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Precipitation of Synthpop due to Cultural and Musical Shifts of the 1970s

The cultural and musical shifts in the 1970s also made the ground fertile for synthpop's emergence. The 1970s was a decade of experimentation and innovation in music. Many musicians were looking for new ways to express themselves, and they were drawn to the unique sound of the synthesizer.

Some of the most important cultural and musical shifts that led to the emergence of synthpop include:

The rise of punk rock: Punk rock was a rebellious and experimental genre of music that emerged in the early 1970s. Punk rockers rejected traditional music values and experimented with new sounds and styles. This spirit of experimentation helped to pave the way for synthpop.

The development of new music technologies: In the 1970s, a number of new music technologies were developed, including the synthesizer, the drum machine, and the sequencer. These technologies allowed musicians to create new and innovative sounds that were not possible with traditional instruments.

The growing popularity of electronic music: Electronic music was becoming increasingly popular in the 1970s. Bands like Kraftwerk and Yellow Magic Orchestra were using synthesizers to create new and futuristic sounds. The popularity of electronic music helped to create a demand for synthpop.

Synthpop in the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom is widely regarded as the birthplace of synthpop. In the mid-1970s, a new generation of British musicians began to experiment with synthesizers and electronic instruments. They were inspired by the German band Kraftwerk, whose pioneering work in electronic music had a profound impact on the British music scene.

One of the earliest synthpop bands in the UK was Ultravox, formed in 1974 by John Foxx and Billy Currie. Ultravox's early sound was heavily influenced by Kraftwerk, but they quickly developed their own unique style, which incorporated elements of art rock and glam rock.

Another early synthpop band was The Human League, formed in 1977. The Human League's early sound was more experimental than Ultravox's, but they eventually moved towards a more pop-oriented sound in the early 1980s.

Other notable synthpop bands from the UK include OMD, Depeche Mode, New Order, The Cure, and Duran Duran. These bands all achieved mainstream success in the 1980s, and while not wholly synthpop, their music helped to define the synthpop sound.

History of Synthpop in the United States

Synthpop first emerged in the United States in the late 1970s, as a subgenre of new wave music. It drew inspiration from pioneering German bands like Kraftwerk and the Japanese band, Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). American synthpop artists were also inspired by the DIY ethos of punk rock, and they often used synthesizers and other electronic instruments to create new and innovative sounds.

One of the earliest and most influential American synthpop bands was Devo. Devo formed in Ohio in 1972, and they quickly developed a unique sound that combined elements of new wave, punk rock, and electronic music. Devo's music was often satirical and humorous, and they were known for their distinctive visual style, which incorporated elements of science fiction and technology.

Another important early American synthpop band was The Cars. The Cars formed in Boston in 1976, and their music was more pop-oriented than Devo's. However, The Cars were still one of the first American bands to embrace the use of synthesizers, and their music helped to popularize synthpop in the United States.

Synthpop began to decline in popularity in the mid-1980s, as other genres of music, such as grunge and hip hop, began to emerge. However, synthpop has continued to have a cult following, and it has also influenced other genres of music, such as dance music and electronica.

History of synthpop in Russia

Synthpop emerged in Russia in the late 1970s. However, the development of synthpop in Russia was hindered by the Soviet government's strict censorship of music.

Soviet Government Music Censoreship

The Soviet government censored music for a number of reasons, including:

To maintain control over the population: The Soviet government was a totalitarian regime, and it used censorship to control the flow of information and ideas. Music was seen as a powerful tool for communication, and the government wanted to ensure that only music that was in line with its ideology was released to the public.

To promote socialist realism: Socialist realism was the official artistic doctrine of the Soviet Union. It was a style of art that was supposed to depict the lives of ordinary people in a positive light. The Soviet government censored music that did not conform to the principles of socialist realism.

To suppress dissent: The Soviet government was very afraid of dissent, and it used censorship to suppress any music that was critical of the government or its policies.

The censorship of music in the Soviet Union was very strict. All music had to be approved by the state before it could be released. The government also controlled radio and television stations, and it only allowed music to be played that had been approved by the state.

Despite the censorship, there was a thriving underground music scene in the Soviet Union. Many musicians released their music unofficially, and they often performed at secret concerts. The underground music scene was a way for musicians to express themselves freely and to challenge the government's ideology.

The censorship of music in the Soviet Union began to relax in the late 1980s, during the period of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). This led to a flourishing of new music genres in the Soviet Union, including synthpop.

Russian Synthpop Bands

Despite the challenges, a number of Russian synthpop bands emerged in the early 1980s. One of the earliest and most influential Russian synthpop bands was Forum. Forum was formed in 1983, and they quickly became one of the most popular bands in the Soviet Union. Forum's music was a unique blend of synthpop, rock, and traditional Russian music.

Other notable Russian synthpop bands from the early 1980s include:

Kino

Bravo

Tatu

Glukoza

Bi-2

Splean

Zemfira
