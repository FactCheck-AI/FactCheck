MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The owners of Ameritech have announced pay phones charges will increase to 50 cents from 35 cents per call.

SBC Communications Inc. announced Friday that it would begin phasing in the new charge next week in the company's 13-state service region. Ameritech is a subsidiary of SBC.

All pay phones on the SBC network should be converted to the higher charge by September, the company said.

SBC officials said the increase is needed to maintain remaining pay phones as more consumers switch to wireless phones, prepaid phone cards, pagers and other forms of communication.

"This price increase will address our efforts to keep as many of our pay phones in place as possible for those who use and depend on them," said Randall Feger, president of SBC Public Communications.

Feger said pay phone use has declined significantly in the past four years, but he declined to disclose the number of pay phones in the SBC network.

Besides Wisconsin, the increase affects pay phones in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, California, Nevada, Connecticut, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and Arkansas.

The rate increase is not subject to regulatory approval, since pay phones are considered a competitive service under federal telecommunications law.

Ameritech will eliminate per-minute charges in Illinois as part of the increase. Pay phone users currently pay 35 cents for the first three minutes of a local call and 25 cents for each five minutes thereafter.
