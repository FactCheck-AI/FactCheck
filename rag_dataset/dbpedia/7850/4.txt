A profanity-laced song written by Bob Odenkirk and David Cross and performed by Jack Black in “Run Ronnie Run!” will be up against a children’s tune sung by Olivia Newton John in “The Land Before Time X” at the 2003 DVD Exclusive Awards on Dec. 2.

They are just two of the five nominees in the song category, along with a tongue-in-cheek melodramatic Broadway show tune sung by Mandy Patinkin in the Odenkirk and Cross comedy “Run Ronnie Run!”

Disney (including Dimension/Miramax and Pixar) leads the pack with 38 nominations, followed by 27 for Warner/New Line. This year’s show, to be hosted by Jenny McCarthy at the Wiltern Theater LG in L.A., will be produced by Dick Clark Prods. Event will air Dec. 9 in primetime on FX.

Chris Cooper, Bob Hoskins, James Earl Jones, Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, Jessica Alba, Brenda Blethyn and Amy Smart are among the actors nominated for performances in movies that made their exclusive premiere on DVD, while Dick Van Dyke and Carl Reiner, Peter Jackson, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are among those nominated for their work on special editions of their films and TV shows.

The third annual event will include the special DVD Exclusive Director Focus Award to Scott and a creative achievement nod to comicbook legend Stan Lee in recognition of their work on DVD special editions of their productions. Also to be presented will be the first-ever DVD Exclusive Studio Innovation Award to Pixar Animation Studios and the Comedy Franchise Award to the “American Pie” series, being accepted by producer Chris Moore and stars from the trilogy of movies and presented by cast members from one of the original teen comedies, “Animal House.”

Martin Short and Jason Alexander are each nominated in the animated character category for their voice work on the Disney DVD premiere sequel “101 Dalmatians II: Patch’s London Adventure.”

“Dalmatians” is tied with exotic New Line period drama “The Sleeping Dictionary” with the most nominations at 10.

As evidence of a voting system that gives equal weight to movies regardless when released, “Dalmatians” was released Jan. 21 and “Dictionary” was released Feb. 18. The Odenkirk-directed “Melvin Goes to Dinner,” with seven mentions, will be released Dec. 16.

In the special-edition group, this week’s release of “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers — Special Extended Edition” leads with seven nominations, followed closely by six each for the recently released “Finding Nemo” and the upcoming Dec. 2 release of Fox’s 9-disc set of “Alien Quadrilogy.”

The DVD Exclusive Awards event is a production of Daily Variety sister trade publication DVD Exclusive magazine.
