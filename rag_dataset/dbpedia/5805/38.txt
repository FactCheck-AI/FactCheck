Our buckthorn berry extract is an extract produced from buckthorn berries Rhamnus cathartica L.

Rhamnus cathartica, the European buckthorn, common buckthorn, purging buckthorn, or just buckthorn, is a species of small tree in the flowering plant family Rhamnaceae. It is native to Europe, northwest Africa and western Asia, from the central British Isles south to Morocco, and east to Kyrgyzstan. It was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub in the early 19th century and is now classified as an invasive plant in several US states and in Canada.

This extract will give sunny yellows in a slightly alkaline bath, and khaki greens with a post-mordant of ferrous sulfate.

The color is extremely lightfast and stable.

Use: dissolve 1-3% WOF in warm water and add to a dye bath. Heat to below a boil for around 30 minutes.

Color uptake on alum-mordanted protein fabric and aluminium lactate mordanted cellulose fabrics is fast, and usually, 30 minutes in the dye bath already gives the most intense colors. Add a little soda ash to bring out warmer and saturated yellows.

Rhamnus berry extract is a great product for use in print pastes and inks.
