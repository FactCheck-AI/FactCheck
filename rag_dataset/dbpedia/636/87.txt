Mr Forbes, whose films included the 1970s horror classic Stepford Wives and Whistle Down The Wind, died after a long illness, a family spokesman said.

He was married to actress Nanette Newman and had two daughters, TV presenter Emma Forbes and journalist Sarah Standing. His last novel, The Soldier’s Story, came out last year.

A family friend, journalist Matthew D’Ancona, said Mr Forbes died at his home in Virginia Water, Surrey.

He added: “Bryan Forbes was a titan of cinema. He is simply irreplaceable.”

East London-born Mr Forbes was made a CBE in 2004 for services to the arts and the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain.
