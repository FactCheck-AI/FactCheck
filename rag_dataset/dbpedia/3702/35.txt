Compilation albums had been in the UK charts since 1956, when the Carousel original soundtrack was #1 for a total of six weeks out of 38 between 1956 and 1961. Decca even had two EPs, All Star Hit Parade (1956) and All Star Hit Parade No 2 (1957) in the singles chart.

Between 1959 and 1972 there were many releases on labels such as Pye, HMV, Parlophone, Philips, Decca, Tamla Motown, Atlantic, Polydor, Stax, CBS, Island, Music for Pleasure, Marble Arch, EMI, Hallmark and Trojan.

However, in 1972, something big happened. Three major players emerged that would have the power of advertising on their side: K-Tel, Ronco and Arcade Records. They blazed the way for other labels to produce commercially successful albums containing current hits by various artists, bringing them all together and negating the need to by the albums the singles had spawned from.

Here, in order of how they entered the UK charts are the very first successful albums credited to Various Artists that used the power of advertising.

K-Tel

As Advertised on TV

Canadian Philip Kives was a demonstration salesman, selling cookware door-to-door. Using his own money he formed his own company, K-Tel (“K” for Kives) and created a new type of television commercial, originally marketing a Teflon-coated frying pan. In a deal with a department store and a local TV station, he continued to produce commercials. Kives bought and marketed a range of products from Seymour Popeil, father of Ronco founder Ron Popeil. In 1965, he began successfully selling knives in Australia, and later sourced his own products.

In 1966, Kives marketed his company’s first compilation album, 25 Great Country Artists Singing Their Original Hits on the Artistic label, which sold out. This was soon followed by 25 Polka Greats, the first album to bear the K-Tel name.

K-Tel was officially incorporated in 1968 and expanded throughout the 1970s. His cousin Raymond ran the US division from 1967 to 1977, and then he was in charge of the European wing between 1977 and 1984.

In Australia, K-Tel owned Majestic Records who had been releasing compilation albums since the mid-1960s. It was run by Peter Reedman and Kives recruited his twin brother Don to set up a UK division of K-Tel Records in the early 1970s. Using the tagline “20 ORIGINAL STARS – 20 ORIGINAL HITS”, Reedman’s first project was 20 Dynamic Hits, released in 1972.

20 Dynamic Hits (K-Tel, TE 292, 1972)

20 Dynamic Hits featured British artists like rockers Deep Purple (who got two tracks on the album) and Liverpudlian songstress Cilla Black alongside American funk band Sly & the Family Stone and Mexican guitarist Carlos Santana.

It contained no UK No 1s and one hit wonders Danyel Gerard, Ronnie Dyson, Redbone, The Congregation, and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Don Reedman was not afraid to include releases that were outside the UK Top 50, or even did not chart.

In a 2005 article published in the Independent, “K-Tel: the secret history!”, Bob Stanley spoke to founder Philip Kives about the success of K-Tel, and remarked that his father bought the album, along with three million other people. The cover looked like it had been put together by a kid with Letraset and felt tips.

The album broke into the UK albums chart on June 4, 1972, at #4. The following week it began its eight week run at #1. In all, the album was in the chart for 28 weeks.

Arcade Records

As Advertised on TV

While 20 Dynamic Hits was enjoying its seventh week at the top, a new player in budget compilation albums entered the arena: Arcade Records. Entering at #4, just as 20 Dynamic Hits had done, was 20 Fantastic Hits By the Original Artists.

Arcade Records was a British record company specialising in mid/budget price multi-artist compilation albums founded in 1972. Founder Laurence Myers had been managing and producing for British artists such as David Bowie and the Rolling Stones. He realised that music consumers were home taping their favourite songs, creating mixtapes. He decided to copy this trend by releasing multi-artist and one-artist compilation albums.

While other budget labels like Hallmark and Music for Pleasure had been relatively successful, they often contained versions of hits by soundalikes. Myers decided to only pick original artists and songs for his albums.

Like K-Tel, Arcade relied heavily on TV and radio advertising.

20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists (Arcade, 2891 001, 1972)

Arcade’s first release was 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists and featured British artists like Rod Stewart, Slade, The New Seekers, and Daniel Boone, alongside international acts such as The Osmonds, Melanie (who gets two tracks on the album), and the Bee Gees.

Also included were one hit wonders The Mixtures and The Piglets. Donny Osmond appears twice: with his No 1 hit “Puppy Love”, and alongside his brothers with a song that did not chart. Daniel Boone gets two mentions, as he co-wrote the last track, performed by the Chelsea Football Team.

20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists entered the UK albums chart at #4 on July 29, 1972 and then on August 6, 1972 replaced K-Tel’s 20 Dynamic Hits at the top, where it stayed for five weeks. It then dropped to #2 for two weeks while Rod Stewart was #1 with Never a Dull Moment but returned for one more week. 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists spent a total of 24 weeks in the chart.

20 All Time Greats of the 50s (K-Tel, NE 490, 1972)

Knocking 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists was the next release from K-Tel, 20 All Time Greats of the 50s. It went straight into the chart at #1 on October 7, 1972 and promptly stayed there for eight weeks. It would return for three further weeks on December 17, 1972.

The album contained tracks that might have been popular on British radio but most did not make it into the UK singles chart. Therefore, the selection was probably based upon their success in the US. However, the album did contain two UK #1s, one each from from Guy Mitchell and Doris Day.

Ronco

As seen on TV

Ronco was founded in the US by American inventor Ron Popeil in 1964. Initially, the company sold gadgets developed by Ron’s father, Samuel. During the 1970s, Ron began developing his own products.

When, in 1966, rival company K-Tel released its first compilation album, 25 Great Country Artists Singing Their Original Hits, selling every copy, Popeil was inspired to set up his own label. Ronco’s first album was Do It Now – 20 Giant Hits, released in 1970. In the United Kingdom their first release was 20 Star Tracks Vol 1, in 1972, which went to #2 in the UK albums chart. The following year they released the That’ll Be the Day soundtrack album, which was their first of three #1 albums in the UK.

After the emergence of the Now That’s What I Call Music! range, Ronco disappeared from the UK market in 1984 after its parent company went bankrupt.

20 Star Tracks Vol 1 (Ronco, PP 2001, 1972)

Making its debut at #3 on October 21, 1972 was Ronco’s first release Star Tracks Vol 1. It would peak at #2 for two weeks and spend just 13 weeks on the chart. The album cover was arguably similar to that of K-Tel’s 20 Dynamic Hits.

The album featured British artists like Cat Stevens, Mott the Hoople, Mungo Jerry, and the Sweet alongside Canadian singer-songwriter Buffy Sainte-Marie, American Scott English, and English-Australian singer Olivia Newton-John. Also included was Laurie Styvers, who never had any hits in the UK, and songs for acts popular in the UK that did not chart.

There 13 UK Top 20 hits including two 1s: “Amazing Grace” from The Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and “In the Summertime” by Mungo Jerry.

Despite the title claiming this to be volume one, there was no volume two to follow.

22 Dynamic Hits Vol II (K-Tel, TE 291, 1972)

K-Tel’s oddly titled sequel to 20 Dynamic Hits, 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II, followed its predecessor by also entering the UK chart at #4. It began its chart run of 12 weeks on November 25, 1972 and it peaked at #2 for two weeks at the very end of the year, held off the top spot by 20 All time Greats of the 50s.

Whereas 20 Dynamic Hits contained no UK No 1s, 22 Dynamic Hits Vol. II had three, from Chicory Tip (named on the album sleeve as Chickory Tip), Joe Cocker, and T Rex. As on the previous release, this one contained a few singles that did not chart. In 1972, the UK chart comprised of the Top 50 and one of the tracks, “Brandy (You’re a Fine Girl)” by Looking Glass had made it as far as #51.

20 FAntastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Two (Arcade, 2891 002, 1972)

Hot on K-Tel’s 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II, was Arcade;s 20 Fantastic Hits by the Original Artists Volume Two, entering the same charts at exactly the same time but at #5. It would spend 13 weeks in the chart and also peak at #2.

Making a return were the New Seekers, Dawn, the Bee Gees, Donny Osmond, Melanie, and Slade. They were joined by the likes of T Rex, Derek & the Dominoes, Bay City Rollers, Sammy Davis Jr and Mary Hopkin. The album featured five No 1 hits, two one-hit wonders in Mardi Gras, and Frederick Knight, one song that did not chart and a b-side to a top selling single.

It was in the company of three K-Tel albums in the Top 5: 25 Rockin’ and Rollin’ Greats at #1, 20 All Time Greats of the 50s (#3) and 22 Dynamic Hits Vol II (#4).

Tamla Motown

In 1959, Berry Gordy Jr founded Tamla Records, which was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation the following year. From 1965 the label Tamla Motown was used outside the US. Previously, Motown records were released in the UK on London American Records (1960-1961), Fontana Records (1961-1962), Oriole American Records (1962-1963) and Stateside Records (1963-1965).

In 1967, Tamla Motown released British Motown Chartbusters, which went to #2. The following year, British Chartbusters Vol 2 went to #8. From 1969, the title was shortened to Motown Chartbusters. Volumes 3, 4 and 5 were all #1s but Volume 6 was a #2.

Motown Chartbusters Vol 7

Charted at #44 on November 25, 1972 and spent a total of 16 weeks in the Top 50, peaking at #9.

25 Rockin’ & Rollin’ Greats (K-Tel, NE 493, 1972)

The following week, K-Tel unleashed another album, going straight in at #1 and staying there for three weeks. 25 Rockin’ & Rollin’ Greats would be in the chart for 18 weeks.

The album contained 17 Top 20 hits including five #1s from Bill Haley & his Comets, Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, the Dave Clark Five, Lonnie Donegan, and Roy Orbison.

20 Flash Back Greats of the Sixties (K-Tel, NE 494, 1973)

On March 25, 1973, K-Tel had another album go straight in at #1, and it was there for just two weeks at the start of its 11 week run in the chart.

16 of the tracks on 20 Flash Back Greats of the Sixties had been Top 20 hits, including five #1s from the Kinks, the Searchers, Gary Puckett & the Union Gap, Scott McKenzie, and the Byrds. Three tracks did not chart, one of which was from Joanie Sommers who never had a UK hit single.

Arcade returned to the charts on April 7, 1973 with 40 Fantastic Hits from the 50s and 60s, debuting at #2 but not doing any better than that during its 15 week run.

This was the first 2-LP set from the “As Seen on TV” labels to chart. 34 tracks had achieved Top 10 in the singles chart, and the selection included 12 #1s. Neil Sedaka had two songs on this album, both had peaked at #3. Just one song, from Frankie Laine did not chart.

EMI Records Ltd

Electric and Musical Industries Ltd, was formed in 1931 by the merger of the Columbia Gramophone Company (including Parlophone) and the Gramophone Company (“His Master’s Voice”). That same year, the company’s legendary Abbey Road studios were opened.

EMI released its first LPs in 1952, which were released on a variety of subsidiary labels such as Parlophone, HMV, Columbia and Capitol Records. With so many stellar artists like the Cliff Richard, the Beach Boys, Nat ‘King’ Cole, the Beatles, and Frank Sinatra, they became the best-known and most successful recording company at the time.

In 1967, Columbia and Parlophone took care of rock and pop music, and HMV became solely involved in the release of classical music. Two years later, Harvest Records took on the emerging progressive rock genre including Pink Floyd.

Electric and Musical Industries Ltd became EMI Ltd in 1971. EMI Records Ltd was a British record label founded in 1972, and launched in 1973 as the successor to Columbia and Parlophone. They signed new musical acts that became global successes: Kraftwerk, Queen, Olivia Newton-John, Iron Maiden, Kate Bush, Sheena Easton, Pink Floyd, for example.

In 1979, EMI acquired United Artists Records, and merged with Thorn Electrical Industries to form Thorn EMI who, in 1991, took over Chrysalis Records and Virgin Records.
