Labels can release compilation albums on Spotify.

Even if the releasing label doesnâ€™t have streaming rights for some songs, they might still show in the compilation due to track-linking.

Track-linking replaces unavailable tracks with an identical version that has streaming rights. The compilation plays as normal, but royalties get paid to the rights holder instead of the compilation label.
