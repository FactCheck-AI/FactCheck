A great compilation album can tell a story. The compilations in this list all tell a chapter in northwest music history.

The compilation album is a lost art. With the advent of single-song purchases on iTunes, streaming services and algorithm-based recommendations, there is little interest in a multi-artist album these days. Like mixtapes and the boombox, the compilation album is a souvenir from yesteryear.

The humble compilation album, however, still had its stature in the 80s and 90s during the heyday of the northwest music scene, and there was no shortage of them; some good, some bad. This is a list of some of the good ones. Most of these albums made very little commercial impact, but each exemplify a different aspect of the northwest music scene. Like any good compilation album, these albums should introduce you to some new bands that you might not have heard otherwise.

International Pop Underground Convention (K, 1992)

In 1991, K Records founders Calvin Johnson and Candace Peterson got the idea to put on a festival to celebrate the “DIY” aesthetic that their label championed. In August of that year, they pulled it off, hosting a five-day festival at the Capitol Theater in Olympia, with more than fifty bands. The next year, K released a compilation featuring 21 of the bands who played the convention. Melvins, Spinanes, Bratmobile, Girl Trouble and, of course, Beat Happening, are some of the bands featured on this compilation.

The International Pop Underground Convention was a monumental event and one that is worth exploring in its entirety in its own article.
