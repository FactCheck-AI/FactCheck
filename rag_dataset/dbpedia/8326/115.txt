Sofia recently chatted about how she plays her Modern Family character Gloria.

“I play her the way I see my mom and aunt behave as Latin women,” Sofia shared to Time.

She added, “I went to the writers and said, ‘We wouldn’t do this, Colombians don’t dress like that.’ I cannot blame the writers. You write what you know, and you cannot tell an American writer to write about some other culture and expect that it will be as natural as writing about an American person.”

FYI: Sofia is wearing a Bella Dahl button down.
