The Military Bishopric of Argentina (Spanish: Obispado Castrense de Argentina) is a military ordinariate (special diocese) of the Roman Catholic Church that provides religious services to Catholics serving in the Argentine Armed Forces.

It is exempt, i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See and its Roman Congregation for Bishops, and usually not combined with another see (unlike some other countries).

Its patron saint is Our Lady of Luján and the Episcopal seat is located at the (also Marian) Cathedral of the Star of the Sea (Catedral Stella Maris) in Buenos Aires, national capital of Argentina.

Statistics

As per 2014, it provides pastoral care to Roman Catholics serving in the Argentine Armed Forces, paramilitary National Gendarmerie and Naval Prefecture of Argentina in 4 parishes and 237 missions with 195 priests (178 diocesan, 17 religious), 1 deacon, 29 lay religious (17 brothers, 12 sisters) and 8 seminarians.[2]

History

It was created as the Military vicariate of Argentina on 8 July 1957, and elevated to the Military ordinariate of Argentina on 21 July 1986.[3] It remains known as Obispado Castrense (Army bishopric), as in several hispanophone countries.
