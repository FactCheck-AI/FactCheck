Myanmar is trying to nominate the ancient city of Inwa to the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO's) world heritage list in addition to three other Pyu city states, official media reported Sunday.

Noting that Myanmar has fulfilled the requirement for the nomination of the city with ancient pagodas and buildings, the New Light of Myanmar said the Inwa Cultural Heritage Zone near northern Mandalay must be preserved, quoting Minister of Culture U Aye Myint Kyu.

Inwa was an imperial capital of successive Myanmar kingdoms from the 14th to 19th centuries and was abandoned after it was completely destroyed by a series of major earthquakes in March 1839.

It was also a popular day-trip tourist destination from Mandalay.

Myanmar was also trying to nominate three Pyu city states -- Beikthano, Hanlin and Sri Kestra to the world heritage list.

Myanmar has been cooperating with the international community in striving for preservation of its cultural heritage.
