World No. 3 Carlos Alcaraz survived a five-set battle Sunday against No. 4 Alexander Zverev to win the 2024 French Open men's singles title. The 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-1, 6-2 victory helped Alcaraz, 21, become the youngest man to win a major on all three surfaces.

Alcaraz was down two sets, but he managed to climb back and force the decider despite needing a medical timeout in the fourth set to take care of his left thigh. Zverev created issues for Alcaraz with his powerful serve, and at one point Alcaraz even told his team how much he was struggling with the height and bounce of the ball.

Nevertheless, Alcaraz remained persistent and earned his third Grand Slam trophy after a competitive match that lasted four hours and 20 minutes.

Rafael Nadal, who has won a record-14 trophies at Roland Garros, was not 100% healthy coming into the tournament and got eliminated in the first round by Zverev. However, he still watched the final and congratulated his fellow Spaniard on the achievement.

In the women's competition, world No. 1 Iga Swiatek completed her French Open three-peat with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Jasmine Paolini on Saturday. She is now the youngest active player with at least five Grand Slam trophies.

Paolini found a 2-1 lead in the first set, but Swiatek responded by completely taking over and winning the next 10 games. Paolini was able to get on the board in the second set, but Swiatek had all the momentum and was impossible to stop.

Swiatek has now won 19 consecutive clay matches, including the Madrid and Italian Open finals. She became the first player to win those titles along with the French Open since Serena Williams in 2013.

Although she lost Saturday, Paolini is having a breakout season at age 28. She had not made it past the second round of a major until this year and will be making her debut in the WTA top 10 next week.
