Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocino): Pharos (Gr); a cloak, makros (Gr); long – ‘long cloak’ in reference tail which is almost twice the length of the rest of the body, moncino; named after Dr. J.M Mocino (1757-1819) who was a Mexican naturalist.

The common name of Quetzal is derived from an Aztec word, quetzalli, for the birds tail feathers which were used as headdress ornaments with the number on the headdress indicating stature within a community. There are several myths and legends surrounding this magnificent looking bird in Central America, where it lives in cloud forests (distribution map below). One such myth is when it was a spirit guide to a warrior prince of Guatemala (read that story here).
