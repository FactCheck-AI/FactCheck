Dino De Laurentiis, legendary producer of such cult films as Flash Gordon and Dune, has died in Los Angeles aged 91, his family has said.

He began his career in Italy working with Roberto Rossellini and Federico Fellini, winning an Oscar for producing the latter's 1954 film La Strada.

After moving to the US in the 1970s, he oversaw films such as Serpico, Death Wish and the 1976 remake of King Kong.

He also produced four films featuring the serial killer Hannibal Lecter.

His daughter Raffaella De Laurentiis said in a statement her father was surrounded by family when he died on Wednesday night at his home in Beverly Hills. She did not give a cause of death.

"Cinema has lost one of its greats," said Walter Veltroni, former mayor of Rome and a founder of the International Rome Film Festival.

"The name of Dino De Laurentiis is tied to the history of cinema," he told the AFP news agency.

The son of pasta makers, De Laurentiis was born on 8 August 1919 in Torre Annunziata, near Naples.
