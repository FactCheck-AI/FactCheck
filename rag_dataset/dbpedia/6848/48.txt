Previously Unissued: Ben & Oscar's last ever collaboration!

This outstanding DVD gives us the rare opportunity to not only listen to one of the most important and influential tenor saxophonists in jazz: Ben Webster, but to see him in performance, exquisitely backed by the Oscar Peterson Trio (featuring Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen). This performance marks their final collaboration (and their only known recording together after 1959), as Ben died less than a year later, on September 20, 1973.

Ben Webster (ts), Oscar Peterson (p), N.H.Ø.P. (b) & Tony Inzalco (d). NDR Jazzworkshop TV broadcast. Live at the Funkhaus, Hannover, December 14, 1972.

Tracks:

1. Poutin'

2. Sunday

3. I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good

4. Perdido, 5. Come Sunday

6. For All We Know

7. Cottontail.

Running time: 55 min. (Color / Stereo)

NOTE: Although German TV recorded tracks 8 to 10, they were not filmed, as the original broadcast was shorter than the actual concert. In order to complete Ben Webster's performance from this evening ("Autumn Leaves" is a piano solo by Peterson), these are included as audio bonus tracks.

8. Ben's Blues
