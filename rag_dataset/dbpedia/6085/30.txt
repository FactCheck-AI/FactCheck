The NHL Arizona Coyotes have announced the club has signed a multi-year agreement with Bonneville Phoenix to broadcast all Coyotes regular season and playoff games on KMVP 98.7 FM Arizona’s Sports Station or KTAR ESPN 620 AM.

All games will also be streamed live on the Arizona Coyotes and Arizona Sports apps. Games on ESPN 620 AM will be simulcast on 98.7 FM HD-2.

Bob Heethuis returns for his 17th season as the club’s play-by-play announcer to call all games on the Coyotes Radio Network. Olympic silver medalist Lyndsey Fry will provide radio color analysis for all Coyotes home games.

“We are thrilled to be back with Bonneville Phoenix and are very excited to broadcast all Coyotes radio games on Arizona Sports 98.7 FM and ESPN 620 AM this season,” said Coyotes president and CEO Xavier Gutierrez. “Arizona Sports 98.7 FM is the Valley’s true leader in quality, local sports programming and we are looking forward to Bonneville providing our fans with outstanding Coyotes coverage all season long.”

Coyotes game broadcasts on 98.7 FM and ESPN 620 AM will all include 30 minutes of pregame coverage prior to the puck drop and 30 minutes of coverage after the game concludes. The postgame show will include player interviews and a live broadcast of Coyotes head coach André Tourigny’s postgame press conference.

The Coyotes pregame and postgame shows will be hosted by Luke Lapinski, who is also co-host of Wolf & Luke, Arizona Sports’ show that airs weekdays from 10 a.m.-2 p.m.

“We are incredibly happy that the Coyotes are back where they belong on the Arizona Sports team,” said Scott Sutherland, senior vice president and market manager of Bonneville Phoenix. “Our thanks to the Meruelo Group, particularly Xavier A. Gutierrez, whose passion and vision for this organization is unparalleled. We’re very excited to see the team thrive both on and off the ice.”
