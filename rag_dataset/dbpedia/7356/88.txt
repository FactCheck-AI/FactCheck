South Carolina Law, in conjunction with the College of Arts and Sciences, hosted Judge J. Michael Luttig Thursday, September 15 for Constitution Day. His talk focused on the necessity of reviving the Constitution and the Rule of Law from which he believes the country has strayed.

Of note

Judge Luttig, former judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit appointed by President George H.W. Bush, made headlines this year testifying before the U.S. House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, stating that the attack was a “war on democracy.” He also co-authored “Lost Not Stolen: The Conservative Case that Trump Lost and Biden Won the 2020 Presidential Election,” issued in July 2022.

In his words

“To whom do we turn? The answer lies in the first seven words of the Constitution written by the prophets of our nation’s founding. We turn to ourselves, to ‘We the People of the United States.’ We ourselves must come to the aid of our struggling America.”
