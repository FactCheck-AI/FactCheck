Byron Anthony has hit out at Bristol Rovers boss Mark McGhee following his release by the club after six years.

The defender made 20 appearances before McGhee's arrival in January but was then sent out on loan to Hereford.

"He said he would give everyone an opportunity but he didn't give me the chance to show what I could do.

"He didn't see me play or know me as a player, but I'll take it on the chin and move on," the 27-year-old told BBC Radio Bristol.

Anthony joined Rovers from Cardiff City in 2006 and made 191 appearances for the club in total.
