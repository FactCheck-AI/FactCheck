The fourth film in the Kino Quickies season, screened on April 24th 2022, was Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street from 1936.

Directed by George "King of the Quickies" King and starring Tod Slaughter, it's the well known story of the murderous barber who polishes off his victims who are then processed into pie filling by his next door neighbour. Yum!

Our specially invited expert guest for the post show Q&A, Jade Evans, had a minor disaster the night before the screening when she tested positive for the dreaded Covid. Luckily, we had the technology to enable her to attend remotely via the wonders of the internet and the sound quality was only slightly affected.

Your hosts are Dom Delargy and Dr Lawrence Napper

None of the prints of Sweeney Todd, as far as we can tell, are in perfect condition but if you'd like to watch a scratchy copy online, you can do that HERE.

And this British Pathe short feature starring Tod Slaughter is hoot!
