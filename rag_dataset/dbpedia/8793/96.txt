The common European currency, the euro, enjoys higher popularity among Slovaks than the euro area average.

A total of 76 percent of Europeans think the euro is a good thing for the European Union, a recent Eurobarometer survey shows. The figure is higher, at 81 percent, for Slovakia. In general, this is the highest support for the euro since the introduction of euro coins and banknotes in 2002.
