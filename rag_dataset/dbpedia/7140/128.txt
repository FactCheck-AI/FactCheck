Over the past year, the industrial metal sector has faced several economic and geopolitical challenges. However, the metal industry’s growth trajectory looks bright, with solid demand from the automotive, manufacturing, and infrastructure sectors.

In this article, we take a closer look at three fundamentally sound metal stocks Rio Tinto Group (RIO), Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO), and Anglo American plc (NGLOY), to help you determine whether they are worth your attention.

Before diving deeper into the fundamentals of these stocks, let’s discuss the factors shaping the industry’s growth.

The ongoing global economic recovery is expected to boost demand for construction, transportation, and manufacturing metals. The World Bank’s metals and minerals price index rose 10% in the first quarter of 2023, indicating a positive outlook for stronger demand in the face of supply disruptions for some critical metals.

Moreover, the increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is expected to drive the demand for industrial metals such as copper, nickel, and cobalt. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of EVs on the road is expected to reach 145 million by 2030, up from 11 million in 2020.

Governments and businesses increasingly invest in sustainable infrastructure projects, such as green buildings and renewable energy facilities. These projects require large amounts of industrial metals such as steel and aluminum. The Global Infrastructure Outlook estimates that $94 trillion in infrastructure investment is needed by 2040 to meet the global demand.

The global mining market grew from $2.02 trillion in 2022 to $2.14 trillion in 2023, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.1%. Moreover, the global metal and mineral market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 7%, reaching $10.65 trillion in 2027.

Thanks to growing demand as well as increased government investments, the industrial-metal sector is well-poised for growth in the long term. Given this backdrop, we believe quality metal stocks RIO, SCCO, and NGLOY are well-positioned to capitalize on the industry’s tailwinds. To that end, let’s evaluate the fundamentals of the featured stocks.

2024 STOCK MARKET OUTLOOK

Rio Tinto Group (RIO)

London-based mining and metals company RIO is involved in the global exploration and production of materials through four segments: Iron Ore; Aluminum; Copper; and Minerals. Its business includes diamond mining, sorting and marketing, and lithium exploration.

On June 20, RIO invested $498 million in its Kennecott operation in Utah to increase copper production from underground mining and improve key assets. This investment will be used for underground development and infrastructure for the North Rim Skarn area, which is expected to deliver around 250 thousand tonnes of additional mined copper over the next ten years.

Further, it allows RIO to strengthen its copper supply in the United States, which could increase its revenue and profitability.

The same month, the company announced the partnership with Gemco Rail to bring local iron ore rail car manufacturing and bearing maintenance to the Pilbara region.

Under this, RIO would invest approximately A$150 million ($100.05 million) to purchase 100 locally built ore rail cars over six years and continued investment in bearing refurbishment over ten years to support the company’s Pilbara operations. This is an industry-first initiative and could help RIO to reduce costs and support the local economy.

On April 28, RIO announced the acquisition of the Platina Scandium Project, a high-grade scandium resource in New South Wales, from Platina Resources Limited for an approximate consideration of $14 million.
