Will “Watermelon Sugar” stay at #1 for a 5th week or can “Break My Heart”, “Before You Go” or “Roses” take over the top spot?

Guest hosts are of course of varying quality; I actually liked Mike "Fitz" Fitzpatrick's presentation last week. Haven't heard Lil' Jon's yet. Some actually seem engaged and even knowledgeable about chart facts as well as the music, while others barely seem to know or care what they're talking about.

That said, this is the third of the last four weeks when AT40's been guest hosted, which is a bit much. Not sure what confluence of events in Ryan's life or schedule are resulting in this (American Idol auditions? Vacation? Sick day?) but I hope he's back next week.

also i think this is the first time i've heard the robot lady or whatever say "number 40" lol. i don't think i've ever heard that before

They used to do that every week when I discovered the show in 2015, but they got rid of it in March 2016. (I still vividly remember being confused as hell the week they got rid of it because back then I listened to the entire show every week lol.)

Looks like we are going to go into mid October with a song that debuted the previous year which most likely will be Don’t Start Now by Dua lipa.

It’s nothing new for her since she went into the first weekend of October in 2018 with New Rules.

Dynamite by Taio Cruz has to have to record on that because I believe he went into November of 2011 with that large 72 week span which should have been threatened by Circles by Post Malone which went up another spot on the non recurrent chart to 14 instead of 33 on At40... oh by the way
