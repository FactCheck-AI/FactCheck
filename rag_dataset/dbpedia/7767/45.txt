In 2018, Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum said he was occasionally traveling to San Francisco to work on new music with the band and "have a dialogue about prospects and songs and where we go in the future." Based on a new interview, it doesn't seem that dialogue went anywhere productive.

Much to fans dismay, Bottum revealed, in a new Kerrang! interview, that there aren't any current plans to work on new music, and we may never get any new music.

“You know, there’s no plans right now to record any new music. There’s no plans at all. I think we’re all at an age, or at a time in our lives, where looking back at what we’ve done is a profound place to be. I’m super-proud of what we’ve done in a way that I haven’t been before. I think maybe some years ago it did feel a little bit dirty, like we were taking advantage of the world by just going out there and playing old songs, but for whatever reason I’m in a different place with that right now. I think our legacy speaks for itself in the way the world is right now. It’s refreshing and it’s appropriately provocative to throw ourselves into the world again. It’s a good example of eccentric leftism, if you will.”

The band's comeback album, Sol Invictus, definitely stood up to the band's old material, and if that's the last thing we hear from the band, what a way to go.

Ultimately, I admire that the band choose to just play the hits. Most fans won't mind.

So far, they have some European dates lined up this year:
