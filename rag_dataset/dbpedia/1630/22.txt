Lotus 18 was the first mid-engined car built by Lotus and was a marked improvement over Chapman's early and only moderately successful front-engined formula cars, the 12 and 16. It was introduced for the 1960 F1, F2 and FJ seasons, and 27 examples are believed to have been made though some were rebodied with the Lotus 21 skins to create the interim Lotus 18/21.

The 18 scored Lotus' first Formula One win, in the hands of Innes Ireland at Goodwood in the Glover Trophy.
