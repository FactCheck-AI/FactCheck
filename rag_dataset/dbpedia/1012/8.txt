Broadcasting

RTR Planeta is the only provider of Russian-language programming to the Asia-Pacific region covered by the AsiaSat 2 Satellite. To step up the accessibility of its content to viewers RTR Planeta has eagerly embraced new technologies launching in various IPTV, ADSL and other advanced networks.

In October 2009 a separate version of the TV channel to broadcast via the Eutelsat 36A satellite to Ukrainian TV viewers was especially created. This was done because on November 1, 2008 the Ukrainian Television and Radio Broadcasting Council demanded that (Ukrainian) cable operators remove Russian TV channels that did not adopt the Ukrainian legislation from their broadcasting lists. The decision affected, in particular, RTR-Planeta, Channel One and TV Center.[1]

On May 1, 2010, RTR Planeta returned to the Ukrainian cable networks.
