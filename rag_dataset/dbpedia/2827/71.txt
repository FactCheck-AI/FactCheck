In May 2022, PNC Norge AS started with the demolition of the old city bridge to make room for the new one. The new bridge will receive a visual and functional make-over, while keeping the structural qualities of the culturally important construction. The bridge is one of the key features of Drammen’s landscape and very important to the city’s character. PNC Norge AS is applying its profound expertise in bridge construction, building a bridge to last for the next 100 years.

From 2025 the elegant, white bridge will traverse the Drammen River. It will form a core part of the city’s axis between the main square and the railway station. The 180m-long steel bridge will be 19.4m wider than before,

allowing users to cross it by car, bicycle or on foot.

Works will start with the removal of the existing bridge and breaking up the foundations in the water. Then, works on the new river foundations and supports will be carried out on two floating platforms, each measuring 20x20m. Afterwards, the steel parts will be installed before the project will finally be rounded off with a complete surface design. The parts for the steel bridge will be transported by barge from PORR’s new steel construction production plant across the sea to Norway – as transport by water is an effective and climate-friendly alternative to land transport.
