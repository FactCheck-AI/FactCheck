The National Film Registry, a list of films chosen for preservation because of their “cultural, historic and aesthetic” significance to the nation’s film heritage, has added Orson Welles’ The Lady from Shanghai to its roster.

The Librarian of Congress today announced 25 additions to the 30-year-old registry.

Chosen with input from the National Film Preservation Board , which also considers online nominations from the public, this year’s list includes Welles’ 1948 thriller with then-wife Rita Hayworth, as well as Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining, John Ford’s The Informer, Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca and Steven Spielberg’s Jurassic Park.

Welles’ Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons and Touch of Evil were previously included on the list.
