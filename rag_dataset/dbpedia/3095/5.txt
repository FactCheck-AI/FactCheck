On July 3, 2023, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy signed major tax legislation, A.B. 5323, which makes significant changes to the Corporation Business Tax (CBT) regime.1 The most noteworthy CBT amendments include establishing bright-line economic nexus standards, requiring certain captive entities to file in a combined group with their owners, altering the tax treatment of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and foreign derived intangible income (FDII), decoupling from the federal treatment of research and experimental (R&E) expenditures under IRC Sec. 174 in certain cases, changing the treatment of net operating losses (NOLs) and prior NOL conversion carryovers, and adopting the Finnigan method for unitary combined group apportionment. Also, the legislation amends the gross income tax to require the use of CBT sourcing provisions in certain situations.

Bright-line economic nexus adopted

For taxable years ending on and after July 31, 2023, a corporation deriving receipts from sources within New Jersey is deemed to have substantial nexus and is subject to the CBT if it meets either of the following criteria during its fiscal or calendar year: (i) derives receipts from sources within New Jersey in excess of $100,000; or (ii) has 200 or more separate transactions delivered to customers in New Jersey.2 This provision does not preclude a corporation from having nexus with New Jersey if the corporation’s exercise of its franchise in the state is otherwise sufficient for New Jersey to impose CBT as allowed by the U.S. and New Jersey Constitutions and laws. Also, this provision does not prevent a corporation from owing the statutory minimum tax if a corporation has nexus with New Jersey and is otherwise protected from tax based on income under Public Law 86-272.3

Worldwide combined groups

For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2022, a worldwide group must include all members of the combined group, wherever located or formed.4 The combined group must include all the income and attributes of those members regardless of how or whether those members file federal returns or report or include their income in federal taxable income, and without regard to any exemption or exclusion from federal taxable income under the terms of a tax treaty. However, any federal deductions that also are allowed under the CBT that would apply to a U.S. corporation, but that a non-U.S. corporation is prohibited from claiming for federal income tax purposes because the income was not included in federal taxable income or because the corporation is a non-U.S. corporation, are allowed for the non-U.S. corporation members for CBT purposes as though they were U.S. corporations.5

Foreign corporations and treaty protection

For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2022, for a corporation incorporated or formed in a foreign nation with a comprehensive tax treaty with the U.S., and that is not a member of a worldwide combined reporting group, entire net income does not include items of income or loss excluded or exempted from federal taxable income under the terms of the treaty.6 Deductions, exclusions or eliminations are not permitted for any excluded income or loss. For a non-U.S. corporation that files a federal return and is not a member of a combined group filing a New Jersey combined return on a worldwide basis, the non-U.S. corporation only includes its income or loss included in federal taxable income, which is limited to the non-U.S. corporation’s effectively connected income or loss.7

Inclusion of certain captive entities in combined groups

For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, certain captive real estate investment trusts (REITs), regulated investment companies (RICs) and investment companies (ICs) are included in combined groups and taxed in the same manner as C corporations.8 The legislation does exclude certain captive entities that are owned by smaller banks from inclusion in combined groups. For example, a captive REIT9 does not include a company of which at least 50% of the shares is owned or controlled by a state or federally chartered bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association with assets that do not exceed $15 billion.10 Similar definitions are provided for captive RICs and ICs.11

Treatment of GILTI and FDII changed

For privilege periods and taxable years ending on and after July 31, 2023, the statute adopting the federal provision allowing a 50% deduction for GILTI and a 37.5% deduction for FDII is repealed.12 As a result, 100% of FDII is subject to CBT. Because a statute is amended to specify that GILTI13 is considered a dividend for CBT purposes,14 GILTI will now be treated in the same manner as other dividend income. New statutory language provides that entire net income excludes 100% of dividends and deemed dividends that were included in federal taxable income and paid by subsidiaries owned 80% or more by the taxpayer.15 Existing law excludes 50% of dividends or deemed dividends if paid by a subsidiary that is owned at least 50%, but less than 80% by the taxpayer.16

Dividend exclusion and clawback

The exclusion for dividends and deemed dividends is increased from 95% to 100% for dividends that are paid by subsidiaries that are at least 80% owned by the taxpayer.17 The existing post-allocation dividend exclusion is replaced with a pre-allocation dividend exclusion.18 The amount of dividends and deemed dividends that is excluded is then reduced by 5% to reflect a deemed amount of attributable expenses and deductions.19

Decoupling from federal R&E treatment

Under IRC Sec. 174, prior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA),20 taxpayers were allowed the option to currently deduct R&E expenditures or treat such expenditures as deferred expenses to be capitalized and amortized over their life. As amended by the TCJA, for amounts paid or incurred in tax years beginning in 2022 and thereafter, all taxpayers are required to capitalize R&E expenditures over a five-year period for domestic expenses and 15 years for foreign expenses. The recent legislation expressly decouples from this treatment for privilege periods beginning on and after Jan. 1, 2022, allowing taxpayers in New Jersey to immediately deduct R&E expenditures for which a state research credit is claimed,21 notwithstanding the timing schedule required by IRC Sec. 174 for the deduction of specified R&E expenditures.22

Interest deduction limitation

For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation under IRC Sec. 163(j) is applied to a combined group as though the combined group filed a federal consolidated return.23 Under existing law, for privilege periods beginning after Dec. 31, 2017 and ending before July 31, 2022, the interest deduction limitation under IRC Sec. 163(j) applies on a pro rata basis to interest paid to both related and unrelated parties, regardless of whether the related parties were subject to interest expense addback.24

Net operating losses

New Jersey’s NOL provisions traditionally have differed from federal law. However, for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, New Jersey adopts the federal NOL limitation under IRC Sec. 172(a)(2), but substitutes the dates provided in the section.25 As a result, an 80% limitation applies.

An NOL is defined by New Jersey law as the excess of the deductions over the gross income used in computing entire net income, without regard to any NOL carryover.26 For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the NOL is computed after accounting for the deductions for international banking facilities and dividends received,27 allocated to New Jersey.28 Prior to amendment, the NOL was computed without accounting for these deductions.

New Jersey currently allows an NOL for any privilege period ending on or after July 31, 2019, to be carried forward for 20 years.29 For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the portion of the loss that is carried forward is the excess of the loss over the sum of the entire net income, after the deductions for international banking facilities and dividends received30 are allocated to New Jersey.31

New provisions apply if a taxable member of a combined group has an NOL carryover from a loss incurred prior to the taxable member joining the group.32 For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the carryover may: (i) be pooled with the combined group NOL carryover for use by the combined group; or (ii) be used by the taxable member that generated the carryover for that member’s activities that are independent of the unitary business of the combined group. However, the combined group and its members must use tracing protocols for all NOL carryovers.

For privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2022, the Director of the Division of Taxation or a taxpayer may adjust NOLs in privilege periods closed for purposes of the statute of limitations on assessments to determine the correct tax liability in privilege periods that remain open to assessment.33

Prior NOL conversion carryover

In 2018, New Jersey enacted legislation making significant changes to the state’s CBT regime, including adopting mandatory combined reporting and changing the calculation of NOL deductions and carryovers from a pre-allocation to post-allocation basis for tax years ending on and after July 31, 2019.34 As part of this change, unused and unexpired NOL carryovers are converted from a pre-allocation NOL carryover to an allocated prior NOL conversion carryover (PNOLCC). As amended by the recent legislation, for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2023, the amount of the PNOLCC is subtracted from entire net income allocated to New Jersey, after the deductions for international banking facilities and dividends received35 against current privilege period income when the entire net income allocated to New Jersey is greater than zero.36

The remaining balance of PNOLCC deductions of the combined group members may be pooled together and allowed to offset the entire net income apportioned to New Jersey of either: (i) the combined group for which the corporation is a member; or (ii) the corporation that created the PNOLCC, provided the corporation departs the group before the corporation’s respective PNOLCC has been completely used.37 Under existing law, a PNOLCC deduction was allowed to offset only the entire net income allocated to New Jersey of the corporation that created the PNOLCC, and the PNOLCC could not be shared with other members of the combined group.38 For privilege periods ending before the members of a combined group pool their PNOLCC for use by the combined group, a member is allowed to sell PNOLCCs to other members of the group at an arm’s-length price.39

Net deferred tax liability deduction for combined groups

Following the enactment of combined reporting provisions in 2018, publicly traded companies were allowed a deduction40 for the aggregate increase to their net deferred tax liability or the aggregate decrease to their net deferred tax asset, or an aggregate change from a net deferred tax asset to a net deferred tax liability.41 For group privilege periods beginning in 2023 through 2029, the combined group may deduct 1% of the deduction amount during the group’s privilege period.42 For group privilege periods beginning in 2030 and thereafter, the combined group may deduct up to 5% of any remaining unused amount of the deduction during the group privilege period, until the total deduction amount is fully utilized.43 Prior to amendment, a combined group was allowed to deduct 10% of the deduction amount for 10 years for privilege periods beginning in 2023 through 2032.44 As a result of this legislation, the timing of the deduction is substantially lengthened.

Related-party addback repealed

For privilege periods and taxable years ending on and after July 31, 2023, the related-party addback statute is repealed.45 Under this statute, originally enacted when New Jersey required taxpayers to file on a separate reporting basis, taxpayers were required to add back otherwise deductible interest and intangible expenses directly or indirectly paid to one or more related members.

Apportionment factor for unitary combined groups adopts Finnigan method

For privilege periods and taxable years ending on or after July 31, 2023, New Jersey is changing from the Joyce to the Finnigan apportionment methodology for combined groups.46 Specifically, in computing a combined group’s numerator and denominator of the apportionment factor, the combined group, as one taxpayer, must include all unitary receipts of all members of the combined group.47 Previously, in computing the numerator, each taxable member of the group was treated as a separate taxpayer and that member’s numerator included only its receipts assigned to New Jersey.48
