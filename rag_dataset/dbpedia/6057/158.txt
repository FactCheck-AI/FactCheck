Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, as delightful as they are in "Lily in Love," would be lots more fun in a stage revival of the Molnar play than in this endearing but misfired attempt to update it for the screen.

Burdened with a script that reminds one of provincial dinner theater, "Lily in Love" proves entertaining nevertheless. The credit goes to Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith, who transcend lame material with bright, tongue-in-cheek performances.

Makk gives his actors all the room they need to bring this story to life and they deliver.

The strength of this contrived farce is its ability to keep tongue firmly in cheek while playing the nonsense earnestly. Everybody seems to be having quite a good time.

For a change it's great to hear two fine actors converse and not merely talk.

Plummer... makes the most of a unique opportunity. His virtuosity carries all before it and makes us forget the creaky artifice of the film and its dangerously inert pace.

Director Karoly Makk seems oblivious to the screenplay's rank sentimentality and to the special considerations a comedy like this requires.

It has all the freshness and zest of a cave painting.

"Lily in Love" is an irresistible comedy, as commendable for its wit and humor as for showing off the immense talents of Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith.

"Lily in Love" eventually runs out of steam under the unimaginative direction of Karoly Makk. Still, it's a treat to see Christopher Plummer and Maggie Smith tackle the leading roles.
