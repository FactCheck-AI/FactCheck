A Japanese re-release of the hit PS3 racer, MotorStorm Complete adds a number of features and content not included in the original Japanese release, most importantly online play as well as over 60 newly added elements from download packs (including new tracks, racers and more.)

Developed by Evolution Studios, MotorStorm delivers visceral off-road racing, plunging players into a frenzied environment awash with grit, mud and petrol, in a game that leaves the standard rules of racing in the dust. Gone are the limits of power restrictions, limited classes, and qualifying rounds. Players simply choose their vehicle from a massive range – including dirt bikes, ATVs, sand rails, rally cars, monster trucks, and everything in between – then hit the track in a no-holds-barred sprint to the finish line. Carving a swathe of destruction through the ever-changing wilderness, players must compete in a gasoline-fuelled, horsepower spectacle where the only rule is to try and stay alive.
