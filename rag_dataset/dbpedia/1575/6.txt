Gregory:

God has smiled upon you this day

The fate of a nation in your hands

And blessed be the children we,

Who fight with all our bravery

'Til only the righteous stand.

You see the distant flames, they bellow in the night

You fight in all our names for what we know is right

And when you all get shot, and cannot carry on

Though you die, La Resistance lives on.

Gregory and the Other Children:

You may get stabbed in the head with a dagger or sword,

You may be burned to death, or skinned alive, or worse

But when they torture you, you will not feel the need to run

For though you die, La Resistance lives on.

M.A.C.:

Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

Sheila:

Because the country's gone awry, tomorrow night these freaks will fry!

Soldiers:

Tomorrow night,

Our lives will change!

Tomorrow night,

We'll be entertained!

An execution!

What a sight!

Tomorrow night!

Satan:

Up there, there is so much room, where babies burp and flowers bloom

Tomorrow night, up there is doomed, and so I will be going soon!

Terrance and Phillip:

Shut your fucking face, Uncle Fucka!

You're a boner-biting bastard, Uncle Fucka!

Terrance:

Looks like we may be out of luck!

Phillip:

Tomorrow night, we're pretty fucked!

Stan and Kyle:

Why did our mothers start this war? What the fuck are they fighting for?

When did this song become a marathon?

Satan:

I want to be up there...

Sheila:

When Canada is dead and gone, there'll be no more Celine Dion!

Gregory:

They may cut your dick in half,

Soldiers:

Tomorrow night,

Gregory:

And serve it to a pig.

Soldiers:

Our lives will change!

Gregory:

And though it hurts, you'll laugh.

Soldiers:

Tomorrow night,

Gregory:

And you'll dance a dickless jig.

Soldiers:

We'll be entertained!

Gregory:

But that's the way it goes!

Soldiers:

An execution!

Gregory:

In war, you're shat upon! Though you die...

Satan:

I want to be... up...

Gregory:

...La Resistance...

Stan, Kyle, Cartman:

Tomorrow we fight, for La Resistaaance!

Gregory:

...Lives on!!

Soldiers:

Tomorrow night! Tomorrow night! Tomorrow night!

M.A.C.:

Just don't cry out, "Bring your noose!" Blame Canada! Blame Canada! Blame Canada!

Satan:

Up thereeeee!
