British triple jumper Nathan Douglas has been ruled out for the rest of the season after rupturing ankle ligaments in a freak training accident.

The 28-year-old Oxford athlete, a European silver medallist in 2006, sustained the injury by putting his foot through a plyometric box, a piece of equipment used for jump training.

Blow: Nathan Douglas will miss the World Championships in South Korea

Douglas, who could only finish 10th at last summer's European Championships, will now miss August's World Championships in Daegu, South Korea.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Tweeps, unfortunately my 2011 season is over before it has even begun, due to a freak accident at the end of what had been a successful Aviva warm weather training camp in Italy, where my foot went straight through a plyometrics box while hopping, resulting in two ligament ruptures in my ankle.

Crocked: Steph Twell has also seen her season cut short by injury

'Trust me, I will be doing everything within my power to get fit and healthy as quickly & efficiently as possible while aiming to compete in the 2012 Indoor season."

Douglas joins British team-mate Steph Twell in missing the whole campaign. The Commonwealth 1500m bronze medallist fractured her ankle in a cross-country race in Belgium in February.
