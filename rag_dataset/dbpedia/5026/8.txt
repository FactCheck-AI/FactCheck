About the Ship's Name:

Frank E. Petersen, Jr. was born 2 March 1932, in Topeka, Kansas. He joined the US Navy as a seaman apprentice in June 1950. He served as an electronics technician and in 1951 entered the Naval Aviation Cadet Program. In October 1952, he completed flight training and accepted a commission as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

His first tactical assignment was with Marine Fighter Squadron 212 during the Korean conflict. He commanded a Marine Fighter Squadron, a Marine Aircraft Group, a Marine Amphibious Brigade and a Marine Aircraft Wing. General Petersen served two combat tours, Korea in 1953 and Vietnam in 1968. He flew in excess of 350 combat missions, and had over 4,000 hours in various fighter/attack aircraft.

He received his bachelor's degree in 1967 and his master's degree in 1973, both from George Washington University, Washington, D.C. In 1987 he was the recipient of an honorary Doctor of Law degree granted by Virginia Union University. In addition he also attended the following service schools: the Amphibious Warfare School, Quantico, Virginia; the Aviation Safety Officers Course at the University of Southern California; and the National War College, Washington, D.C., class of 1973.

In February 1979 he was selected for promotion to brigadier general, and in May 1983 was advanced to the rank of major general. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 12 June 1986.
