Warrant Officer Davis distinguished himself for heroism while participating in aerial flight evidenced by voluntary action above and beyond the call of duty on 2 May 1970, while serving as an Aircraft Commander with the Air Cavalry Troop, 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, in the Republic of Vietnam. On this date, while flying on a visual reconnaissance mission near the Cambodian border his craft began to receive intense anti-aircraft fire.

Warrant Officer Davis valiantly attempted to destroy the enemy and save the lives of his fellow crew members but was mortally wounded in the attempt. Warrant Officer Davis’ actions were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.
