Comparisons are odious and eventually not very useful. So when you have pianists Oscar Peterson and Count Basie on the same stage, beaming respect at each other (with the assistance of Freddie Green, guitar; Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, double bass, and Skeets Marsh, drums) all you can do is marvel. As I do.

Peterson: OLD FOLKS / WE’LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN / add Niels-Henning Orsted Pedersen, double bass / JUST FRIENDS / I LOVE YOU / MACK THE KNIFE / add Basie [25:45] Freddie Green, and Skeets Marsh: ROYAL GARDEN BLUES / SLOW BLUES IN G / JUMPIN’ AT THE WOODSIDE //

I note that this has been posted by several other people on YouTube, but that duplication is something to celebrate. Let us make sure that everyone devoted to jazz piano and to swing has had a chance to see this interlude and admire the five heroes onstage.
