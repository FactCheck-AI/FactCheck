Isle Royale National Park is proudly one of the least frequented parks in the United States, with just 26,400 visitors in 2019! Located in the middle of Lake Superior, halfway between Michigan, Minnesota, and Ontario in Canada, Isle Royale and the 400 neighboring islands have been a UNESCO-protected biosphere reserve since 1980. And despite the relatively few visitors, the site is wildly popular with shipwreck divers, hikers, campers, and naturalists in search of local wolves, moose, and arctic butterflies.

The park can be accessed by ferry or seaplane, while cars and pets are forbidden in an effort to preserve the ecosystem. Isle Royale “is large, and is fully twenty-five leagues long,” wrote French missionary Claude Dablon in a report on the year 1669-1670 sent to his superiors in Paris. “It is distant seven leagues from the mainland, and more than sixty from the end of the lake.” This priest from Dieppe who moved to New France in 1655 was also an explorer, an ethnographer, an astronomer, a botanist, and a leader of Jesuit missions in the West, where he mapped out the island known to the Ojibwe people as Minong – “a good, high place.” He later campaigned to rename it in tribute to the French king Louis XIV.
