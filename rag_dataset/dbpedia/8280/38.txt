Both the Boy’s and Girl’s Junior Jacks are selected from the best players in and connected to rugby in New England through performances in the high school and club competitions, as well as through skill development and performance testing in the Free Jacks Academy Regional Training Groups.

The Junior Jacks logo is the Free Jacks fists of freedom holding drum sticks. The Junior Jacks drumsticks are adorned with flags that include six stars for the six states of New England.

During the Revolutionary war children were not able to actively serve; however this did not stop young Americans from wanting to do their part. Younger revolutionaries did not only take up the slack in homes and businesses, but could be found playing drums and holding banners on the battle fields.
