Fantastic period piece of Palmerlee's Cigar, Tobacco and Candy shop in Dodge Center, Minnesota from the early 1910s.

Dodge Center is a city in Dodge County, Minnesota, United States. Approximately 15 miles west of Rochester, the population of Dodge Center was 2,670 at the 2010 census.

A bit of history, fantastic for dropping friends or family a note the old-fashioned way, and makes a great gift! This is a reproduction of the original 1910s postcard. Postcard image from LakesnWoods.com.
