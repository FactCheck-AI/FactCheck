1. A SMALL MAN IN A BIG MOVIE...

2. The first appearance on the stage The five-year old Chaplin went on stage alone and sang a well-known tune at that time, &quot;Jack Jones“ in 1894.

3. The next step In 1898 Chaplin joined the dancing group « Eight Lancashire Lads ». ( Later the critics characterized Chaplin`s films as a film-ballet.) In 1900 « Lancashire Lads «took part in the pantomime « Cinderella » where Chaplin ceased the opportunity to make the audience laugh. In the spring of 1901 Chaplin left the group .

4. His debut in the theatre In 1903 Chaplin got a job in a theater where he played the role of the messenger Billy in « Sherlock Holmes ». At that time Chaplin was practically illiterate. When he received his lines he was afraid that he would have to read several paragraphs aloud. His brother Sidney helped him to learn the role by heart.

5. Chaplin became an actor In 1908 Chaplin became one of the actors of Karno`s company that created sketches for many music halls. Chaplin played the leading roles in a number of productions. Chaplin first toured America with the Fred Karno troupe from 1910 to 1912. After five months back in England, he returned to the U.S. for a second tour, arriving with the Karno Troupe on 2 October 1912. In the Karno Company was Arthur Stanley Jefferson, who would later become known as Stan Laurel . Chaplin and Laurel shared a room in a boarding house. Stan Laurel returned to England but Chaplin remained in the United States.

6. Chaplin`s first film In 1914 Chaplin produced his first film « Caught In The Rain» where he was an actor, a producer and a script writer. Gradually Chaplin`s earnings grew up. (in 1914 he received 150$ a week, in 1915 he got 1250$. But in 1917 Chaplin signed a contract to the sum of 1 million$ and became the most high-paid actor.)

7. Charlie The Tramp « Mabel`s Strange Predicament » was the first film where Chaplin appeared in the image of a tramp . He put on wide trousers, a tight morning coat, a bowler and held a walking stick in his arm. But Chaplin was rather young, a moustache made him imposing .The image of a tramp had lyric and tragic features.

8. Academy Awards Chaplin won one Oscar in a competitive category, and was given two honorary Academy Awards. In 1972, Chaplin won an Oscar for the Best Music in an Original Dramatic Score for the 1952 film Limelight , which co-starred Claire Bloom . The film also features an appearance with Buster Keaton , which was the only time the two great comedians ever appeared together. Due to Chaplin's political difficulties, the film did not play a one-week theatrical engagement in Los Angeles when it was first produced. This criterion for nomination was unfulfilled until 1972.

9. Chaplin`s aphorisms A murder turned a man into a criminal, but a million murders- in a hero. Life is a tragedy when you see it as a close-up picture and a comedy when you look at it from a distance. Babies and dogs are the best actors. I consider poverty neither attractive nor instructive.
