The text-align-last property in CSS is used to set the alignment of the last line in a block or paragraph, just before the line break. This property can be applied to control how the final line of text is aligned within its containing element, whether it ends naturally or due to the use of a <br> tag. By leveraging the text-align-last property, web developers can fine-tune text alignment to achieve desired visual effects and improve readability. This article will explore the syntax, property values, and practical applications of the text-align-last property in CSS.

Understanding the text-align-last Property

The text-align-last property in CSS specifies the alignment of the last line of text within an element. It is particularly useful for adjusting the alignment of text that ends abruptly, such as in headlines, subheadings, or paragraphs.

Syntax:

text-align-last: auto|start|end|left|right|center|justify| initial|inherit;

Default Value: Its default value is auto.

Property Values:

left: It makes the last line of the paragraph left-aligned with respect to the container.

right: It makes the last line of the paragraph right-aligned with respect to the container.

center: It makes the last line center-aligned with respect to the container.

justify: It makes the last line justified, i.e., the last line will occupy the entire width of the container, extra space is inserted between the words to achieve this property.

start: It makes the last line left-aligned, if the direction of text is left-to-right (LTR) and it makes the last line right-aligned, if the direction of text is right-to-left (RTL).

end: It makes the last line right-aligned, if the direction of text is left-to-right (LTR) and it makes the last line left-aligned, if the direction of text is right-to-left (RTL).

auto: It makes the last line of the paragraph to be aligned as per text-align property of the container when the text-align property is not set to justify.

initial: It makes the last line of the paragraph to be aligned as per its default value (left-aligned).

inherit: It makes the last line of the paragraph to be aligned, as per the text-align-last property of its parent element.

Example: In this example, we are using text-align-last: left; property.
