The formatting of Images and text is done using CSS. They can be aligned and floated to allow the images to be placed in particular locations on the page. Using these options will help you create content that is easier to understand.

Aligned images do not wrap text around them. Aligning images will only position the image left, right, or center with the text following before and after the image. Aligning leaves quite a bit of white space on your site. You will see the white space when you go through the aligning section.

A floated image will let the text wrap around the image as a regular book or newspaper would. Images can also be floated, so they appear horizontally on your site. This is good for displaying images like a gallery. The following sections will explain how to float and align images using CSS.

Left, Center, and Right Align

Images can be aligned left, right, and center using the div tag and an inline CSS style. Text DOES NOT wrap around images that are simply aligned. The following explains how to align your images left, right, and center using CSS.

Left Align

The line of code below is for aligning an image to the left.

<div style="text-align: left"><img src="image/your-image.png" width="100" /></div>

Center Align

The following line of code is for centering an image.

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="image/your-image.png" width="100" /></div>

Right Align

The following line of code contains the CSS attribute for aligning right.

<div style="text-align: right"><img src="image/your-image.png" width="100" /></div>

Floating Images Using CSS

Floating images allow images to align horizontally with each other and allow text to wrap around the image. The following will explain horizontally aligning images and floating images around the text.

Floating Images Left to Wrap Text

This code aligns an image to the left of a text block. Note that the margin in the code determines the space around the image. The code defines the space in pixels going clockwise: top, right, bottom, and left.

<img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="image/your-image.png" width="100" />

Important! Floated images will overlap each other if the float is not cleared. Ensure you place a clear float code after each section your image is floating in. Below is the code to clear your floats.

<br style="clear:both" />

Floating Images Right to Wrap Text

The following code floats an image to the right. Notice that the margin differs from the code used when an image is floating to the left.

<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="image/your-image.png" width="100" />

Floating Images Left Horizontally

This will use the same code as before (See below). The images are simply placed one after another to get them to float horizontally. Floating images in line with each other is another way to display your images as a gallery.

<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 0px 15px 15px;" src="image/your-image.png" width="100" />

This concludes how to align and float images with CSS. Use these options to help create more informative and creative content by blending your text and images on your web pages.
