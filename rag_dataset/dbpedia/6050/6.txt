About Aladdin Trouble

The hit team of Johnson and Langwade have done it again with another bestselling, bright and shiny panto for you to get your audience up on their feet and cheering for!

THE SONGS

While these 11 songs have such breadth in musical variety and character expression, they all have one thing in common – they are simply unbelievably catchy and enjoyable! Jasmine has a song of independence and girl power, Widow Twankey and her Wishy Washy crew have a cheeky, laugh-out-loud washing song, and there’s a bustling market song, a heartwarming ballad and SO much more – there is truly something for everyone!

THE STORY

This has all the adventure of the original Aladdin story, but with enough witty banter and wow factor to keep you smiling long after the curtain call. This is a story of belonging, identity, friendship, magic and of course, good conquering evil!

THE CHARACTERS

Follow an independent princess finding her identity, the cheeky chappy Aladdin trying to stay out of trouble and win the girl of his dreams, and of course, a wish-granting Genie who happens to be in the right place at the right time! We've made sure to include all the essential panto villians too- so get practising your boos and hisses!
