R programming is one of the most requested skills by employers in the data science industry. If youâre considering learning the R language, youâll be happy to know that itâs available to the public for free under the Free Software Foundationâs GNU General Public License.

Some consider R to be more challenging to learn than other programming languages, but those with a statistical background may find it to be easier. You can learn more about the R programming language, what itâs used for, and how to learn it in the following article.Â

R programming language overview

R is a free, open-source programming language, meaning anyone can use, modify, and distribute it. It was initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (also known as R&R) of the University of Aucklandâs Statistics Department. However, the statistical programming language we know today as R is a collaborative effort made up of many global contributions and managed by the R Core Team.Â

R programming language features and environment

R is an implementation of the programming language S. Similarly, it allows users to implement new functionalities by defining new functions. It also has integration capabilities with C and C++. Other notable features of R include:

Wide range of libraries

Large and active community of users

Optimal data storage and handling

Suite of data analysis tools and operators

Packages to develop neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI)

Conditionals, loops, input and output facilities, and user-defined iterative functions

Platform-independent and capable of running on all operating systems (Windows, Mac, UNIX, Linux)

What is R programming used for?

Most commonly, the R language is used for data analysis and statistical computing. Itâs also an effective tool for machine learning algorithms. R is especially relevant for data science professionals due to its data cleaning, importing, and visualization capabilities. You can use it to create graphics such as charts and use statistical techniques like data reduction, classification, and clustering.Â

R programming examples

One of the most notable features of R is its versatility. Here are a few examples of industries that use it:

Social media companies. Social media platforms collect massive amounts of data every day. Many of the actions you take online are tracked, stored, and used by analysts to target advertising. R is often used by companies to parse, analyze, and visualize these insights.Â

Health care. The R programming language is used in epidemiology to track and predict the spread of disease. Itâs also employed in drug discovery to analyze the data collected during pre-clinical trials.Â

Financial technology (FinTech). R is one of the most popular programming languages in the financial services industry. Itâs used for credit scoring, risk management, and statistical analyses for investment predictions.Â

Pros and cons of R programming

What is the best way to learn R programming?

There are a couple different ways to learn to program in R. You might determine which one is right for you by considering your learning preferences, budget, and time constraints. Those who prefer more hands-on guidance may benefit from enrolling in an online program, whereas learners who enjoy independent study may not require as much instruction. Below, you can browse recommendations for online courses, certificate programs, Guided Projects, and community resources for independent learning.Â
