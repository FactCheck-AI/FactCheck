ISO currency codes are identifiers for currencies made up of three alphabetic characters as specified in ISO 4217 issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO 4217 codes were updated in 2015.

The first two characters generally refer to countries and the third character normally specifies the particular currency or type of funds.

Used within SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) messages, ISO currency codes are often referred to as SWIFT codes.

Examples of ISO currency codes (SWIFT codes) are USD for United States dollar and CHF for the Swiss franc.

For the Swiss franc (CHF) the 'CH' part refers to the Swiss Confederation, standing for Confoederatio Helvetica, its Latin name.

The country identifiers are taken in turn from ISO 3166.

ISO 4217 also provides numeric codes for currencies for use in countries that do not use the Roman alphabet.

For example, the numeric code for the US dollar is 840 and the Swiss franc is 756.
