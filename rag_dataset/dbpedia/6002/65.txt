Freiburg, Germany, is a globally renowned city that has earned the status of being one of the cleanest and most environmentally friendly cities on the planet, thanks to its extensive use of solar energy and the implementation of ecological technologies in construction.

The "Solar Settlement" in Freiburg (Die Solarsiedlung in Freiburg) is an entire residential district that serves as an example of creating future-oriented homes. Spanning an area of 11,000 square meters, it features 59 residential buildings with a total area of 7,850 square meters, along with a commercial center.

These buildings are energy-efficient, meaning they produce more energy than they consume. All the houses are constructed using wood and other environmentally friendly building materials. They have roofs completely covered with photovoltaic modules for electricity generation. The architecture of the buildings is based on the principles of helio-architecture, where glass structures are oriented towards the south to maximize passive solar heating. The sloped roofs provide shading for windows during the summer season.

The photovoltaic system of the settlement has a nominal capacity of 445 kW and is capable of generating approximately 420,000 kWh of solar electricity per year. This amount of energy nearly triples the consumption of the settlement's residents. The excess energy is sold at a green tariff, bringing additional income to the settlement.

By combining solar installations with energy-efficient buildings, approximately 200,000 liters of diesel fuel are saved annually and 500 tons of CO2 emissions are prevented.

Almost the entire space of the solar settlement is a pedestrian zone and bicycle-friendly area, as cars are limited and almost entirely absent. This became possible due to the presence of a large parking lot beneath the commercial center, where car-sharing is practiced. The city of Freiburg has a network of bicycle lanes spanning approximately 500 kilometers.

The "Solar Ship" commercial center is the world's first commercial facility built on the "Energy Plus" principle. It is located along the transportation artery and serves as a sound barrier for the main residential buildings. The complex features nine three-story penthouses on the rooftop, and two underground levels house storage spaces and a garage with 138 parking spaces.

The initiator and architect of the project is Rolf Disch. His own house, known as Heliotrop, served as a prototype for the Solar Settlement. Heliotrop is the world's first building that produces more energy than it consumes. All the necessary energy for the building is obtained from renewable sources.
