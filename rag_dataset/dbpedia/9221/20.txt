Americana, Red-Dirt Band Reckless Kelly has been burning up stages with their high-energy blend of rock and country music since 1996. Fronted by central Idaho natives Willy and Cody Braun, the brothers are part of a rich musical legacy that began with their grandfather and continued with their father and uncle’s band The Braun Brothers. Twenty-five years ago, the legacy grew when Willy and Cody migrated south to Austin, TX, added drummer Jay Nazz to their core, and formed a band that would change Texas’s musical history forever. As an indispensable part of the Texas music scene for almost 3 decades Reckless has released 16 albums, toured internationally, and built the annual Braun Brothers Reunion festival into a three-day event held in Challis, Idaho that is celebrating 40 years in 2024. Reckless Kelly has played over 3,000 shows and traveled over 1,500,000 miles to 49 states. Reckless Kelly will be kicking off the first leg of their 2024 – 2025, The Last Frontier Tour in April. The band is made up of the brothers, drummer Nazz, Joe Miller on bass, and Geoffrey Queen on lead guitar.
