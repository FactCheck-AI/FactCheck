Enjoy a catered Portuguese meal and the company of our charming guest, with a reading and discussion of her latest novel, Above The Salt

"ABOVE THE SALT is an irresistible and sweeping love story that follows two Portuguese refugees who flee religious violence and reignite their budding romance in Civil-War America. Based on a true story, the novel is a captivating tribute to the power of love and the sacrifices we make to harness it." From People Magazine: "Vaz explores the complexities of duty, passion and sacrifice in an engrossing narrative that celebrates life's abiding beauty.‚Äù (From the publisher)
