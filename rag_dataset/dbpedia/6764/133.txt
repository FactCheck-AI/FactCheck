English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist Rudyard Kipling's major works include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901) and many short stories and poems. Kipling was born in India, which inspired much of his work and his innovative stories for children have become timeless classics. Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the British Empire, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1907.
