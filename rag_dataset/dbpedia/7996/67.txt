When it comes to his divorce, Arnold Schwarzenegger is relieved there was no collateral damage.

The Terminator star recently gave insight into his split from Maria Shriver, who he was married two for 25 years before news of his affair with family housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena derailed his relationship in 2011.

"[The divorce] was very, very difficult in the beginning. Eventually, you move on," Schwarzenegger told The Hollywood Reporter in an article published May 16. "I have a wonderful girlfriend, Heather Milligan, who is very successful."
