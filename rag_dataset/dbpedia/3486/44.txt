Horse Soldier Bourbon is authentic American history, bottled. Experience the legacy & Live Legendary. We now carry all three expressions.

On Tuesday, March 28, 2023, from 5:00-6:00 pm, Pine State Beverage and Lt Colonel ret. Rob Schaefer, 30 years with US Army as a Green Beret, Senior US Diplomat, and Brand Ambassador for Horse Soldier Bourbon will host a seminar at the NH Liquor & Wine Outlet in Nashua on the DW Highway.

This event allows a limited number (35) of registered participants to learn first-hand about the history behind the Horse Soldiers, the team who answered America’s call days after 9/11 with a daring insertion on horseback, into northern Afghanistan. This brave and unconventional act earned them the moniker of “Horse Soldiers.”

Attendees will purchase tickets for $12 through Eventbrite, which allows them class participation, glassware, and a $10 NHLWO coupon off 2 or more bottles (valid 3/28/23- 4/3/23) of the following items.
