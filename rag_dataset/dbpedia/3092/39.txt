In 1968, Governor Richard J. Hughes signed into law the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority Act of 1968 establishing the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority (NJPBA) in response to the inability of both commercial and public broadcasters to adequately cover public affairs in the State of New Jersey.

The NJPBA is the FCC licensee of the following television broadcast stations which are operated in concert as a statewide network:

Effective July 1, 2011, the NJPBA entered into a Programming and Services Agreement with Public Media, NJ, a not-for-profit corporation, to provide public television programming and services on these channels under the name of NJ PBS and online at mynjpbs.org. The NJPBA works to ensure that PMNJ provides high-quality, non-commercial programming that serves the needs and interests of the citizens of New Jersey and furthers NJPBA's educational objectives. Such programming includes a weekday nightly news and public affairs program, live broadcast of New Jerseys annual State of the State Address and Budget Message, and live coverage of New Jersey's elections, as well as other cultural, educational, and inspirational programming.
