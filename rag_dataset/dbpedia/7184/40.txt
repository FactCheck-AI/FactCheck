New York - Live Gamer (www.livegamer.com ), the world's first combined digital commerce and advertising platform for the interactive entertainment industry, announced today that it will power the virtual economy in Rise of Immortals, the new Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game from Petroglyph.

Petroglyph has broken new ground in the MOBA genre with free-to-play Rise of Immortals, and has introduced unique socialization features like a social hub where players can show off their enhanced Immortals, a chat system, leader boards, and friend lists, an innovative character progression system, persistent level progression and skill trees, as well as cooperative Player versus Environment (PvE) mode â€“ without the upfront cost of a typical MOBA game. Virtual goods and microtransactions let players engage and advance within Rise of Immortals at their own price point and pace, offering an experience that truly stands apart from existing MOBA titles in the market.

Petroglyph has integrated the Live Gamer Elements platform into Rise of Immortals to drive the game's virtual economy. As a complete monetization engine, Live Gamer Elements includes virtual and digital goods catalog management, earned and bought currency support, item storefronts and merchandising, as well as deep analytics and international payment gateways.

"Petroglyph has built quite a bit of innovation into Rise of Immortals, bringing players features and game play that are new to the MOBA genre," said Andrew Schneider, President and Co-Founder, Live Gamer. "We're excited to be working with them to power some of these new features, and wish them the best of luck with the release."

"Live Gamer's Elements technology allowed us to quickly develop micro-transaction inventory, catalog and price management systems for Rise of Immortals," said Steve Wetherill, Producer at Petroglyph Games. "Elements proved to be a great match for our requirements, enabling us to focus our development efforts on our game and at the same time shortening our time to market."
