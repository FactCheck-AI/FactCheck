NTA provides a suite of reports for viewing more detailed probe data from different perspectives. Detailed reports for probes are organized into the following reporting groups:

Traffic reports—Provide overall traffic statistics for the selected time range for probe tasks.

Application reports—Provide rate of traffic statistics by application with details for an individual application.

Source reports—Provide rate and percentage distribution of traffic by source host for the task for the selected time range.

Destination reports—Provide rate and percentage distribution of traffic by destination host the task for the selected time range.

Session reports—Display the rate and percentage distribution of traffic on source and destination pairs for the selected time range.

Source, destination, and session reports allow you to access more detailed data.

Traffic reports for probe tasks provide statistics for the probe traffic analysis task. The Traffic Trend chart displays average traffic rate, and minimum average, maximum average, and average traffic rate statistics in a table for the associated task. The Traffic Details list provides individual data collection samples: timestamp, total volume of traffic, and traffic rate in seconds. You can filter reports by time range.

To view the reports for a probe task, click the Traffic tab to view traffic reports for the selected probe traffic analysis task.
