Lyrical messages of love come in all forms and span genres. From hip hop to rock, love is a central theme in countless albums and songs — but there’s something special about rhythm and blues. Better known as R&B, this category digs deep into the soul, captivating fans with remarkable cadence, delivery and smooth tempos that enable audiences to feel musicians’ innermost emotions.

Simply put, when it comes to matters of the heart, this genre reigns supreme. Whether an artist is gushing about a new romance or declaring their commitment, R&B love songs have the ability to sonically delight listeners in an intimate, relatable way. Not only do love-centric tracks tell a story from an artist’s perspective, but they can also speak for those who may not have the touching words or moving melodies to express their thoughts. Play one of these singles for a significant other and feelings are instantly known.

Tender lyrics, authenticity and soul-stirring vocals are all hallmarks of a good R&B love song. While there are too many to list, we did our best to include selects that surely deserve a spot on your playlist.
