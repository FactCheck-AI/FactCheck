Executive summary: Gladiator

Joaquin Phoenix in a film actor, and the younger brother of actor River Phoenix. His parents were missionaries for a Christian cult called Children of God, a group often alleged to have condoned pedophilia and used sex as a means of proselytizing. The Phoenix family eventually withdrew from the group. Phoenix was about six when they settled in Los Angeles. His parents hired an agent for their children, and all five kids worked in TV commercials. Home-schooled, Phoenix quit his studies in ninth grade. Like most of the Phoenix family, Joaquin is vegan. A scar on his lip seems to be the remnant of a harelip operation. Phoenix claims it is merely a birthmark.

He grew tired of having his first name mispronounced ("wah-keen" is correct), and called himself "Leaf Phoenix" as a child actor. Alongside Scatman Crothers and Fred Savage, he was a regular on the 1986 show Morningstar/Eveningstar, and his movies include SpaceCamp, Gladiator, and I Walk the Line. He was seduced by Nicole Kidman in To Die For, played the Emperor in Gladiator, crossed boundaries in The Village, and defended the world with a baseball bat in Signs.

Joaquin's brother, River Phoenix, went on to great stardom and sudden death by drug overdose. They were together when he died, at Johnny Depp's Los Angeles nightclub, The Viper Room. River was 23 and Joaquin, just a few days past his 19th birthday, called 9-1-1. Tapes of the call were played repeatedly on tabloid television. After his brother's death, Phoenix retired the name "Leaf" and became again Joaquin. After portraying Johnny Cash in I Walk the Line he either decided that he was more a musician than an actor or staged an elaborate prank to that effect, announcing in 2008 that the romantic drama Two Lovers with Gwyneth Paltrow would be his last film. He has since returned to acting.
