The following is a reference / historical listing of the roadshow and 70mm presentations of The Fall of the Roman Empire in the United States and Canada.

The Samuel Bronston production and Paramount release was directed by Anthony Mann (El Cid, Strategic Air Command) and starred Sophia Loren, Stephen Boyd, Alec Guinness, James Mason, Christopher Plummer, John Ireland, Mel Ferrer, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quayle. The films world premiere was held March 26th, 1964, at the DeMille in New York.

The presentations cited in the Part 1 section of this work were hard ticket roadshow engagements (i.e. special, long-running, showcase presentations in major cities prior to the film being exhibited as a general release). Much like a stage production, these typically featured an average of only ten scheduled screenings per week, advanced admission pricing, reserved seating, and an overture/intermission/entracte/exit music. A souvenir roadshow program booklet and the films soundtrack album were sold, as well, in some locales.

The print types utilized during the films roadshow release were, depending on the booking, (1) 70-millimeter (2.76:1 from Ultra Panavision 70) with discrete magnetic six-channel stereophonic sound, (2) 35-millimeter scope reduction with discrete magnetic four-channel stereophonic sound and optical monaural sound, (3) 35-millimeter scope reduction with optical monaural sound.

Out of the hundreds of films released in North America during 1964, The Fall of the Roman Empire was among only six given deluxe roadshow treatment and among only seven released with 70mm prints.
