The Atari 2600+ has been revealed, and it’s described as a "modern-day faithful recreation" of the classic console. Atari was launched 46 years ago in 1977 and it was one of the first major modern home video game consoles.

The Atari 2600+ comes from Atari and publisher Plaion, and it comes with 10 of Atari's most famous games loaded onto one cartridge, including Adventure and Missile Command. You will also be able to play any Atari 2600 or 7800 game cartridges, so if you’ve got any of those packed away in the basement or attic, it’s time to bust them out!

The Console was designed using "modern technology" and includes the system's iconic CX40 joystick built with the same size and layout. The Atari 2600+ runs on USB power and connects to your screen with HDMI, and it supports multiple resolutions.

The Atari 2600+ launches on November 17, 2023, and preorders are now available for $130 USD. The ten games include:

Adventure

Combat

Dodge 'Em

Haunted House

Maze Craze

Missile Command

Realsports

Volleyball

Surround

Video Pinball

Yars' Revenge

Plaion and Atari are also launching a bundle that comes with the CX-30 paddle controller and a four-game bundle for $40. The games included in this bundle include Breakout, Canyon Bomber, Night Driver, and Video Olympics. What's more, Atari will sell a CX-40 standalone joystick for $35. Finally, Atari will offer Berzerk- Enhanced Edition and Mr. Run and Jump 2600 for $30 each.

This is pretty rad! I think I’m gonna have to get myself one of these!
