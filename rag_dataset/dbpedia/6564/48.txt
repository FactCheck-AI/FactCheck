Mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Johnson.

- Mr. Johnson?

- Back here.

This is the guy I was telling you about.

My friend from Texas.

Oh, yeah.

Howard, get him an application.

Sure.

Sit anywhere you like.

I thought you said I already had the job.

Don't worry. It's just a formality.

- You want some coffee?

- Sure.

- Black, right?

- Right.

Jim, I don't need to tell you

how dangerous it is out there.

The guy's got a f***ed-up leg.

If you were me, would you hire him?

Give the guy a break. He drove 1200 miles.

He's too big a risk.

I could lose my insurance.

Michael, wait!

Mike, why did you tell him about your leg?

He'd have found out sooner or later.

So what? By then you'd have had the job.

That wouldn't be right.

Sh*t, Mike.

Hey, man, I'm really sorry about this.

Don't worry about it, Jim. It's not your fault.

So, now what are you going to do?

I don't know. Maybe I'll rob a bank.

Hey, you need some money?

- That's okay.

- Look, let me spot you a couple of bucks.

Don't worry about me. I said I'd be all right.

Okay. You stay in touch.

Yeah, you, too.

(Honking)

Anybody here?

Is anybody here?

Hello?

I said, "Is anybody here?"

Can I help you?

I need some gas.

Fill her up?

No. Just give me $5 worth.

Texas, huh?

What the devil brings everybody here

to Wyoming?

I'm looking for work.

Just what kind of work you looking for?

I was hoping to get on a drilling crew.

Roughneck, huh?

Why don't you try Red Rock?

About 50 miles down the road.

There's a bar there called "The Red Rock".

Most all of the local crew,

they hang out there.

Hell, maybe somebody there

can head you in the right direction.

Mighty fine old car you got here.

You know...

they just don't make them that way anymore,

do they?

That'll be $5.

$5 it is.

Thank you.

You open?

Yeah.

- Got any coffee?

- Yeah.

Thanks.

I thought you were supposed to be here

last Friday.

I was beginning to think

I'd have to find somebody else.

You are here for the job, aren't you?

(Welcome To Wayne's Place)

(Now Sit And Shut Up!)

You must be Wayne?

Yes.

And you're Lyle, from Dallas, right?

- Right.

- Good.

I just...

Why don't you take your coffee

and let's go back in the office?

There's the five like we agreed.

I'll have the other five ready for you...

when it's done.

Today is Tuesday,

so she'll be out riding most of the day.

I think the best way to do this

is to make it look like a simple burglary.

Just go out to the house...

break in...

and...

mess the place up a little, you know?

Not too much...

just enough.

And...

then when she...

comes in, you...

Well, you know what to do.

Thanks.

I figure the cops will spend

a couple of months looking for clues...

and once they come up empty-handed,

they'll get frustrated and eventually...

they'll...

try to put the blame on some drifter,

some guy just passing through town.

It happens all the time, you know?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Who...

is she?

She's my wife.

(Private Property)

(No trespassing)

Your name Suzanne?

You're married

to a guy named Wayne, right?

I don't know how to tell you this.

But your husband, Wayne...

he plans to have you murdered.

This is a joke, right?

I'm afraid not.

He paid me to do it.

Well, what are you going to do?

I don't know.

I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt...

but it's an awful lot of money.

Can I fix you a drink?

You seem to be taking this a lot better

than I thought you would.

Have you ever been married?

What?

What's your name?

Lyle.

Have you ever been married, Lyle?

Well, it does strange things to people.

Suppose I double his offer,

and you do something for me.

What do you have in mind?

Take care of Wayne.

How much gas you have?

- Got anything smaller?

- Not today.

(To the Sheriff of Red Rock,

Wayne Brown may have hired

a killer to murder his wife.)

(She is likely to do the same.

Please talk to them before...)

Hello?

Hello?

This is not a joke.)

Hang in there, buddy, 'cause I'm going

to get you out of here, all right?

(Red Rock

County Hospital)

- Get a doctor!

- What happened?

- Somebody get a f***ing doctor!

- Wait here, sir.

Dr. Smoot, ER stat!

- What happened?

- I hit him with my car.

Bobby! When?

About 20 minutes ago.

- I've got a pulse. Get him into ER.

- Right away.

Wait here. I'm gonna need to

ask you some questions.

This way, sir.

(Terry)

Are you finished yet?

No. Have you heard anything?

Sorry. You'll have to wait for the doctor.

Hey, wait!

(Red Rock

County Hospital)

I was just gonna move my car.

How's he doing?

It's a good thing you brought him in

when you did. He's lost a lot of blood.

(Red Rock

County Hospital)

Hi, Doc. This the guy that brought him in?

Yeah. Matt, can I talk to you a minute?

(Phone ringing)

Going somewhere?

NURSE:

Red Rock County Hospital...

Yeah, my car's out there and I was...

It's in a red zone and I was gonna move it.

- Matt.

- Yeah?

That was the Sheriff.

He says he's on his way over.

- You didn't call him, did you?

- What do you think?

- You got some ID on you?

- Yeah.

Is there a problem, Officer?

Yeah.

Looks like we have an attempted homicide

on our hands.

Homicide?

What are you talking about?

It was an accident.

Well, then how do you explain these?

He's been shot twice in the stomach.

(No parking)

(Dr. on call)

What about Kurt? How's he doing?

He's pretty bad off

but the doctor says he's gonna make it.

Well, if there's any change in his condition,

you let me know.

Michael Williams.

Well, Michael, you're gonna be spending

some time with us...

until we can get to the bottom of this.

Wayne, can I talk to you for a minute?

- You really gonna hold this guy?

- Why? You got somebody else, Matt?

No, but it doesn't make much sense

he'd shoot him...

then bring him to the hospital, does it?

Yeah, well. Odessa, Texas, huh?

That's not too far. I guess we can always

just get him on the phone...

if we need to ask him any questions.

You and Russ impound the car.

I'll take him down to the station.

Yes, sir.

Get in.

(Sheriff)

(Red Rock

All right, kid. Start talking...

'cause you got about two minutes
