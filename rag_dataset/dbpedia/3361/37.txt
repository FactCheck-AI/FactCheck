About the Show

Martin Clunes (Doc Martin) stars as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the actual story of the Sherlock Holmes author’s pursuing a miscarriage of justice at the turn of the 19th century—the false conviction of a young, mixed-race solicitor who’s being harassed by the local authorities. “Clunes is a terrific Doyle who remains, with all his complexities and contradictions, as fascinating a character as Sherlock Homes,” says the Los Angeles Times.

Co-starring in the three-part miniseries are Arsher Ali (Line of Duty, The Missing) as George Edalji, the lawyer under suspicion; Art Malik (Disney’s The Little Mermaid) as his Indian father; and Emma Fielding (Sanditon,Van der Valk) as his Scottish mother. Also appearing are Charles Edwards (Downton Abbey, The Crown) as Alfred Wood, Sir Arthur’s private secretary and real-life “Dr. Watson.”
