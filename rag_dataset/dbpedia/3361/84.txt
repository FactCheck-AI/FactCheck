Warren got me started watching.

Doc Martin is a British television medical comedy drama series starring Martin Clunes in the title role. …

The programme is set in the fictional seaside village of Portwenn and filmed on location in the village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, United Kingdom, …

Eight series aired between 2004 and 2017 …

The actor, Martin Clunes, is unusual and unusual looking. A touch of Mr. Bean.

The real star is the Cornish village of Port Isaac.

The actress playing receptionist Elaine, Lucy Punch, is brilliant in the role. In fact the eclectic villagers are all entertaining.

But no racial diversity in Cornwall?

Before I started on the TV show I watched the 2001 movie called Doc Martin. Similar premiss. But Doc Martin is a much warmer and more charming character in the film.
