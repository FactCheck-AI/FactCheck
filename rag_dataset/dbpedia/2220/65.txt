This photo of Wade Simmons, shot by Ian Hylands, was for one of the first guidebooks of North Vancouver's trails (unfortunately out of print). Derek Westerlund and Bjorn Enga were doing that old guidebook and needed a shot, so they dragged Wade out of the Cove bike shop where he was working as a wrench. Wade dropped the "Crater" on Mt Fromme on a borrowed Gary Fisher Joshua - he always delivers - and went on to become a professional freerider who was inducted into the Mountain Bike Hall of Fame. Check out the sweet pant clip that he's using to keep his sweat pants out fo the triple ring crankset.This shot is of Sharon Bader, the co-author of the Locals' Guide trail book. She hadn't ridden on the Shore for a while, but I had some old armour retrieved from a local shop dumpster dive for her to wear. Those were different times! Sharon is on the Bark Bridge section of Ladies' Only, on her hand built Brodie Expresso steel hardtail, complete with styling Judy XC front suspension and rocking a full xc lycra kit. Good thing she rides like a girl! Sharon went on to become the President of the NSMBA, helps to organize mountain bike events and authors guide books.Long before Harookz ever held a camera he knew how to perform for the lens. Here he is on a rigid steel hardtail launching off of a drop to flat on Pink Starfish. This is at the site of the old cabin that's now collapsed. Harookz is now a successful professional photographer. Is that a top tube pad on his bike?On a dark, wet day Noel Buckley navigates some cedar wood skinnies on Bookwus, Mt Fromme. Noel went on to found Knolly, a manufacturer of high end mountain bikes. On the front of Noel's bike you can see Marzocchi's first edition of their Z1, a four inch travel fork that changed how suspension was perceived. No, it wasn't light, but it's open bath design and smooth stroke blew minds at the time.
