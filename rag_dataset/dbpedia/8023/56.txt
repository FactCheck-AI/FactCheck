I found a baptism for Jane Wall on Family Search

Jane Wall, baptised 22 November 1840, St Peter, Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, parents: Thomas and Sarah.

I also found her siblings, baptised at the same place.

Charlotte Wall, baptised 7 August 1834

Job Wall, baptised 13 December 1837

Mary Ann Wall, baptised 20 March 1839

Thomas Wall, baptised 26 September 1841

Henry Wall, baptised 14 August 1842

Matilda Wall, baptised 18 March 1844

There are earlier baptisms in what are described as St Peter or Collegiate, Wolverhampton, that I'm not certain are the children of the same Thomas and Sarah.

William Wall, baptised 22 August 1821

Julia Wall, baptised 12 July 1825

Pamelia Wall, baptised 9 May 1825

Thomas Wall, baptised 11 May 1829

George Wall, baptised 30 January 1831.

I found a marriage of a Thomas Wall and a Sarah Hill at St Peters, Wolverhampton on 5 March 1820. I'm just not sure if the later baptisms belong to this marriage.

I found the 1851 census for your Wall family. So, it looks like the earlier baptisms are part of your family, too, meaning the the 1820 marriage is that of Jane's parents. It's odd, though that the age is three years out.

I didn't find Sarah in any later censuses.

Here are a couple of possibilities for her death, all in Wolverhampton.

I only found one possibility for her death. Q1. 1865. Wolverhampton. No age is given. The other Sarah Walls who died in that time period were the wrong age.

Edit: I found an index of Wolverhampton parish registers online. I'll go through them and try to find Thomas and Sarah's parents for you.

I found the most likely baptism for Thomas.

Also Thomas' parents marriage.

Elijah Hill, baptised 4 August 1806

Edward Hill, baptised 16 October 1808

Sarah's parents' marriage

Elijah Hill married Elizabeth Hands, 30 July 1800, St Peter, Wolverhampton

I didn't find the burial of either Thomas or Sarah in the indexes.

I did find Job Wall, infant, buried 11 November 1838, St Peter, Wolverhampton and

Matilda Wall, infant, buried 28 July 1844, St Peter, Wolverhampton

Note: the indexes go back to the 16th century so you can keep tracing your family lines for some time, as long as they remained there. You'll want to check the originals some time, though. There's like a lot more information there, not only in the 18th century, but the 19th. The indexes go up to 1837 for marriages, 1875 for baptisms, and and 1862 for burials.
