The Democratic Alliance stands ready to co-operate with other parties on a case-by-case basis in the interest of good government, DA leader Tony Leon said on Thursday.

”Although final election results are still awaited, it is clear that in a number of towns and cities around South Africa, no party has a clear majority,” he said in a statement.

He said voters had dictated a situation where parties needed to co-operate.

”The DA believes that, where possible, opposition parties should form opposition-governed councils since clearly that is what the opposition voters want,” Leon said.

He stressed it was imperative that the heat and the animosities of the election be put aside in the interest of the ratepayers and the good government of towns and cities.

”We stand ready to co-operate, particularly with other opposition parties, to strengthen democracy in our country by building a stronger and more cohesive alternative to the ANC,” he said.

Divided opposition helps ANC in W Cape

ANC heading for glory in Limpopo

The African National Congress was heading towards a resounding victory in Limpopo on Thursday afternoon with a few less visible parties winning in some municipalities.

Counting had been completed in only eight of 31 municipalities, but the results trickling in showed the ANC had maintained a strong hold on the province.

The ruling party scored a massive 23 out of 26 seats in the Fetakgomo municipality, with the United Independent Front securing a surprising two seats. The Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and Azanian People’s Organisation (Azapo) each got one seat.

A total of 42Ã‚Â 739 votes were cast in Maruleng (Hoedspruit) with 18 seats going to the ANC.

The PAC came second in the municipality with three seats followed closely by the Democratic Alliance with two and the African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) with one seat.

It was a narrower victory for the ANC in Naboomspruit with five seats to the FF+’s two and the DA’s one seat.

The DA and FF+ won two seats each in Modimolle (Nylstroom), but the ANC walked off with an overwhelming 12 seats.

The Onafhanklike Munisipale Kiesersforum in Bela-Bela (Warmbaths) managed to secure one seat, with the ANC winning 12 seats followed by the DA with two.
