We're introducing the latest in Old School Model Works line of kits that you can not only build and fly successfully, but personalize them to your own taste. Old School Model Works is continuing to bring back great designs from the past and rework them to incorporate modern, laser-cut techniques to make kit building better than ever. All of Old School Model Works kits are made right here in the USA.

The Sky Ranger 40 is as much fun to build as it is to fly. Using updated design techniques and laser-cut precision, Old School Model Works designed this kit so most any modeler can successfully assemble it in a short amount of time.

This all-around sport model's retro design looks great in the air and makes you look like an ace pilot. Loop it, roll it, spin it, snap it, and just have a great time flying it.

Power can be from either electric or glow. Old School Model Works designed the fuselage with a built-in hatch held in place with magnets so you have quick access to either your batteries or fuel tank.

Utilizing the unique WEB-LOCK construction, you can build our wings, straight and true - with a minimum amount of fuss. We include sturdy, pre-bent main gear and wheel collars. The 3/16" diameter wire can absorb quite a bit of abuse for those no-so-good landings.

Included in each Old School Model Works kit are full-sized rolled plans, a printed construction manual, pre-bent main gear, hand-selected balsa and ply woods, and a premium hardware package from brand-name, USA manufacturers (DuBro®, Sonic-Tronics, and others) to guarantee the best quality. Also included is a clear, pre-formed plastic windscreen.

What's more is you can cover and finish your Sky Ranger 40 like you want, rather than being stuck with a "me-too" offering that look exactly the same as the others at your local field.

Whether you like gentle cruising, or prefer to tear up the sky, the Sky Ranger 40's wide flight envelope makes it a blast to fly!
