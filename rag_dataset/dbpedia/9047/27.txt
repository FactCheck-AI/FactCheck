Born in 1955 in California, David Murray first studied piano before taking up the alto saxophone.

In the early 1970s, he switched to the tenor saxophone and co-leads a 15-piece ensemble. He then moved to New York and formed a trio with Phillip Wilson and Olu Dara. At the end of the 1970s, he founded the World Saxophone Quartet with Lake, Hemphill and Bluiett.

The 1980s and 1990s were marked by intense activity in various formations, from quartet to octet.
