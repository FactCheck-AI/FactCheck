Interfraternity Council

An Interfraternity Council (IFC) exists where there are two or more North American Interfraternity Conference member (or non-member) fraternities on a campus. The Councilâ€™s purpose is to advance fraternity on campus and provide interfraternal leadership to the entire community. The WSU Interfraternity Council is not affiliated with the national IFC.
