Recently, I received a nifty gift: an Aretha Franklin 7" ("Respect" b/w "Think") in a Valentine's Day Hallmark card. The packaging is a hybrid outer sleeve/greeting card. Hadn't seen that before.

Weirdly, on the back of the card/outer sleeve, it says, "WARNING: This final record contains a chemical known to The State of California to cause birth defects or other reproductive harm."

Aside from the egregarious copyediting fail, has anybody ever seen a health warning on a vinyl record? What could the chemical in question be?

I'll be sure to don a hazmat suit before spinning the record.

Wow, was that a vintage record or a recently minted one? I've never heard of that before. Maybe it is the BPA chemical that has been found in baby bottles (possibly other things too) and caused quite a bit of concern recently.

Lol, California...Never seen that on vinyl.

I've been sorting through that exact warning on health supplements though. The deal is, there can be a trace (of a trace of a trace) amount of strange elements like lead or cadmium in dirt where some food is grown. California labels these things as hazardous, but it's virtually impossible to grow some foods without these trace elements. Fair enough, but it scares some people.

Nobody eats vinyl though..

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't vinyl made from petroleum derivatives by mixing other chemicals? Might be the harmful ingredient.

Where's that darn chemical engineer when you need him/her!

Leave it to Brian Wilson to break all precedents!

I believe he liked his 45's with mustard and relish...

I didn't think corporations could manage anything well!!

That's whacked lol. I'm surprised they didn't put a health warning on the card about the outdoor air pollution the buyer of the card was subject to when they went outside to buy the card. Then again, after the whole "Tide Pod" thing I'm surprised there isn't a label on the card saying "This is Not Food" ........
