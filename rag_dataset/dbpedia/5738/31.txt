DETROIT – A portion of the shuttered Art Van Furniture stores in Michigan could reopen under new ownership and a new name.

A United States bankruptcy judge approved a deal that includes the sale of 17 Michigan locations to a Texas private equity firm, WDIV Local 4 reports.

There were 97 Art Van stores in Michigan when the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in early March – a move expected to close all company-owned locations in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and Ohio. The company began liquidation sales two days before filing for bankruptcy.
