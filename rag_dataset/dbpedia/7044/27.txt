Imax will release four upcoming tentpoles from 20th Century Fox in select international territories.

The multipicture deal will start with the release of DreamWorks Animation comedy Penguins of Madagascar, whose voice cast includes Benedict Cumberbatch and John Malkovich, on Nov. 26, 2014. That’s followed by the rollout of Ridley Scott‘s biblical epic Exodus: Gods and Kings, to star Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton, on Dec. 4.

Imax will also release the late Robin Williams and Ben Stiller starrer Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb on Dec. 17, and EuropaCorp’s Taken 3, starring Liam Neeson, on Jan. 8, 2015.

The Fox films will be digitally remastered and released in Imax’s giant-screen format across Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.
