Hollywood star Bruce Willis strayed off the typical German tourist track this weekend to visit the place of his birth in the town of Idar-Oberstein. According to a report in the local Nahe-Zeitung newspaper, Willis showed up outside the door to the house his parents lived in when he was born on March 19, 1955. Together with his father, David, and youngest brother, also named David, Willis looked around the basement floor of the house, where he spent the first two years of his life, and took photographs of the rooms, the paper reported. The current residents of the house were completely surprised by their famous visitor. "We were sitting in the garden and didn't even hear that someone had rung the bell," said resident Doris Busch. "My mother still had curlers in her hair!" After around 15 minutes, Willis left the house, having explained in broken German that he was there on a purely private basis. He went on to visit the barracks in nearby Strassburg where his father had been stationed with the United States Army.
