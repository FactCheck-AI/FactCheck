Another legendary AM news station owned by Entercom is expanding its footprint via the FM dial.

The company said that starting March 22, KMOX(AM) in St. Louis, which broadcasts on 1120 kHz, will simulcast on an FM translator at 98.7 MHz. The translator previously simulcast KFTK, “97.1 FM Talk.”

The KMOX branding will be “News Radio 1120 AM 98.7 FM – the voice of St. Louis.”

Entercom made a similar FM news move in Pittsburgh recently at KDKA. And in November in Philadelphia, it added an FM signal to carry the news programming of KYW(AM).

In St. Louis, it said the FM frequency of KMOX “will be heard throughout the city’s business district including downtown, Clayton, midtown, Creve Coeur, Maryland Heights and Kirkwood.

The company also adds “The Dave Glover Show” to its afternoon lineup; the show had been on KFTK.

The announcement was made by Senior Vice President and Market Manager Becky Domya and Brand Manager Steve Moore.

Moore was quoted in the announcement saying, “It’s important that KMOX is available on multiple platforms in order to keep the listeners in the business district informed with the latest news throughout the city.”
