Financial Technologies International (FTI), the leading provider of enterprise-wide data management and integrated business solutions to the global banking and securities industry, today announced the rebranding of its entire product suite from StreetEnterprise to GoldenSource. The GoldenSource brand is designed to better position FTI's ability to deliver unique enterprise data management solutions to the financial services industry.

There are significant regulatory and compliance challenges facing many global financial institutions such as 'know your customer', Basel II, Sarbanes-Oxley, and others. Additionally, there are significant opportunities opening to drive new revenue streams with new products and services, new global trading systems, and more. These challenges and opportunities all have a common underlying problem that must first be solved – the lack of consistent, trusted enterprise data to power these financial enterprise systems.

"As the industry focuses more attention on the infrastructure needed to manage regulatory compliance, operational risk, and automation initiatives, it has become abundantly clear that the management and control of data is the cornerstone of all these efforts," commented Tim Lind, senior analyst at the TowerGroup. "Every risk and compliance offer needs the confidence the data their firm's reputation is based on flows from a consistent, auditable, and reliable source."

Many financial services firms are currently addressing the need for trusted single source of enterprise-wide data to power; front office, compliance, regulatory, risk management, middle and back office applications. Many firms recognize that the fundamental step in powering these systems with trusted data is the building of enterprise master files as 'sources of truth' about their securities (products), customers, counterparties, and positions data.

In response to these market developments, FTI has made substantial R&D investments in both its core data management and business solutions, and is announcing its new product brand name GoldenSource. 'Golden', representing trusted and 'Source', representing one source of truth across enterprise data. With GoldenSource, FTI is reinforcing its unique vision of enterprise data management in real-time across all financial services verticals (investment banking, broker/dealer, asset management, mutual funds, custody, etc.).

The GoldenSource brand will replace all FTI's previous product brands known as StreetEnterprise™. GoldenSource Enterprise™ is comprised of two solution suites - GoldenSource Data Management™, the foundation layer for powering financial enterprise systems, and GoldenSource Solutions™, FTI's business solutions based on the GoldenSource Data Management suite. With GoldenSource Enterprise, institutions can realize back-office transformation, as well as power new front and middle office applications, via a single source of trusted data.
