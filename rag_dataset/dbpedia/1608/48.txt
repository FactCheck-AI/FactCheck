Rail Services

The expanded RTD FasTracks rail system through Aurora is transforming the city's landscape and future, providing economic development corridors and connecting major activity and employment centers.

The R Line

RTD's R Line brings light rail service through the heart of Aurora. The 10.5 miles of new light rail connects the existing track at Nine Mile Station up Interstate 225 to the Peoria Station on the A Line. The new R Line provides easy connections to the A Line and the H Line, making it easier than ever to get to the airport, the Denver Tech Center or downtown Denver. The line opened Feb. 24, 2017.

The line, which includes 10 stations in Aurora, provides connectivity to major activity centers like the Aurora City Center, Anschutz Medical Campus and Denver International Airport through a transfer at Peoria to the A Line.

The A Line

The A Line is a 22.8-mile commuter rail transit corridor that operates between Denver Union Station and Denver International Airport.

Featuring two stops in Aurora, the rail line connects these two important areas while serving adjacent employment centers, neighborhoods and development areas in Aurora and Denver.

Transit-oriented Development (TOD)

Through public and stakeholder meetings, the city developed plans to identify development sites and pedestrian and automobile connections, and create a vision for the overall character of Aurora's rail station areas.
