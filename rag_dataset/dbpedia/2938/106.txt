As this month is the 25th Anniversary of the first digital cinema presentation (June 18, 1999) we will be looking back at one of the first of the major milestones in cinema history: the arrival of synchronized sound via Vitaphone.

Warner Bros. introduced Vitaphone on August 6, 1926, with the premiere of their silent feature Don Juan. This feature film had a musical accompaniment and sound effects played via the Vitaphone system. For the first time, even the smallest towns could hear a full symphony orchestra.

On October 6, 1927, The Jazz Singer premiered at the Warner Theater in New York City, broke box-office records, established Warner Bros. as a major player in Hollywood, and is traditionally credited with single-handedly launching the talkie revolution.

Between 1926 and 1931 Warner Bros produced over 1000 short subjects with sound.

For the first time in more than 90 years, six Vitaphone vaudeville shorts of the 1920s will be projected in 35mm, with sound played back from their original 16-inch discs on a turntable designed and engineered by Warner Bros. Post Production Engineering Department.
