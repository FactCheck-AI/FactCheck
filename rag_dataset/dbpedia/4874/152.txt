We were first established in 1937 by Fred Harrison who started the business from humble beginnings, much of the tyre fitting was done on the side of the road. The hard work paid off and in 1942 his son Peter joined the ever expanding firm and we moved to larger premises at White's Barn.

Today, we are still family owned, the backbone of our business hasn't changed, we are still passionate about keeping our local community moving.
