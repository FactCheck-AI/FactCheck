The oldest medical specialty in the U.S., Otolaryngology deals with disorders of the ear, nose and throat, which include the head and neck. At the Department of Otolaryngology at the University of Michigan Health System, we are on the cutting-edge of diagnosing, treating and rehabilitating patients with diseases of the head and neck. And, in coordination with our Comprehensive Cancer Center, we expertly treat head and neck cancers.

Last year we saw more than 60,000 patients and performed 5,181 operations in 9,926 hours. Our Department has consistently been ranked in the top 10 according to U.S News and World Report. Through our Cochlear Implant Program, we have restored hearing to more than 2,000 children and adults. In addition, we have built a national reputation for hearing preservation with removal of acoustic neuromas. Through funding by the National Cancer Institute, the University of Michigan Head and Neck Cancer Specialized Program of Research Excellence was established in 2002 to study head and neck cancer. This is one of only five such programs in the U.S. The Program is intended to translate findings from the research laboratories into clinical practice (and vice versa) to significantly improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of head and neck cancer while decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with this disease.
