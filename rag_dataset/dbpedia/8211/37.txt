Aston Villa have spent the last three seasons outside the Premier League – but they are still one of the most successful clubs in the history of English football.

Villa were relegated to the Championship in 2016 for the first time since 1987, when they spent a solitary campaign in the old Division 2.

But last week their brief hiatus from the top flight came to an end with a 2-1 victory over Derby County in the play-off final at Wembley.

And following Villa’s return to the Premier League, a table of the most successful sides has been published.

The claret and blues sit fifth on the list, ahead of Manchester City who sealed an unprecedented domestic treble by winning the Premier League, FA Cup and EFL Cup.
