And Timothy Dalton proved he was every bit as suave as his on-screen alterego as he passionately kissed a mystery woman during a stroll in Florence, Italy on Wednesday.

The Living Daylights star, 73, couldn't contain his affection for his glamorous companion as the pair locked lips in the street and hugged.

Looking giddy as he walked along, the star cracked a delighted smile, with his companion following close behind.

The Hot Fuzz actor looked typically dapper in a pastel blue shirt worn with baggy black shorts and silver trainers.

His female partner oozed elegance in a clashing print fuchsia and pastel dress worn with sneakers and a cream fedora hat.

Timothy spent three years playing the handsome but ruthless James Bond in the legendary franchise, taking to our screens with The Living Daylights in 1987 and 1989's Licence To Kill.

The star's next film outing sees him voice Mr Pricklepants in upcoming blockbuster, Toy Story 4, due for release on June 21, 2019.

This marks the star's return to film work following a seven year break.

He also has a lead role as Dr. Niles Caulder / the Chief in DC Comics TV series Doom Patrol.

Timothy had a long-term relationship with actress Vanessa Redgrave between 1971-1986.
