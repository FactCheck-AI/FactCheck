Breeze through your washing with the new washer dryer from SERVIS. It has an 8kg wash and a 5kg dry capacity, which makes it perfect for large households. If you have sensitive skin, you’ll love the Anti-Allergy setting. It uses higher temperatures and extra rinses to get rid of 99.9% of irritants like dust and pollen. The I-Refresh Function also uses micro vapour technology to reduce creases and refresh delicate fabrics, leaving your favourite sequin dress looking as good as new. The Direct Motion Motor is great too, as it’s very quiet and durable, which is ideal for open-plan living.
