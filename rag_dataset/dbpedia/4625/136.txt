LINEAPELLE developed a system for viewing leather records online as a virtual visit of Fashion Studio. The archive is accessible and available free to subscribers.

The courses aim to increase knowledge regarding leather and provide greater awareness in its selection and use for the creation of the manufactured item. These are addressed to all professionals working in the various end-use sectors of leather products.

If you are looking for an original location in Milan, LP Fashion Studio's large hall can become the ideal frame for events connected with the fashion and leather world, such as corporate communication, conferences, fashion presentations and catwalks, as well as exhibitions or cultural events.
