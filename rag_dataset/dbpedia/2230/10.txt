The Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to delay the criminal case against a woman accused of running a prostitution ring in the nation’s capital.

Deborah Jeane Palfrey, 51, of Vallejo, Calif., is accused in federal court of racketeering by running a prostitution ring that netted more than $2 million over 13 years, beginning in 1993. Palfrey says that her escort service, Pamela Martin and Associates, was legitimate.

Palfrey’s civil attorney filed papers last week with the Supreme Court asking for an emergency stay of the racketeering case. Montgomery Blair Sibley argued that it was unfair to proceed against Palfrey because her assets had been seized in a civil forfeiture case, meaning she lacks the means to hire an attorney of her choice.

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. denied the application Wednesday. No explanation was given.

Palfrey’s case has drawn attention because of her threats to expose high-profile officials. An ABC News report this month on Palfrey’s client list mentioned NASA officials, military officers, chief executives and a career Justice Department prosecutor as clients. ABC did not identify the individuals, saying their names were not newsworthy.
