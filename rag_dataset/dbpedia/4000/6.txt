Early Origins of the Forst family

The surname Forst was first found in Holland, where the name became noted for its many branches in the region, each house acquiring a status and influence which was envied by the princes of the region. The name was first recorded in South Holland, a province of Holland, the most crowded province of the Netherlands. The principal cities are Rotterdam, Leyden and Shiedam. Noted is the famed castle of Teilengen where Jacqueline of Bavaria is buried. In their later history the surname became a power unto themselves and were elevated to the ranks of nobility as they grew into this most influential family.

The name is a "topographic name for someone who lived by a ford or crossing point, Middle Dutch voorde, or a habitational name from a place named with this word, for example Tervoort in North Brabant." 1
