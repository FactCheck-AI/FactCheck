2022 Act – New System

Electoral Reform Act 2022 provides for transfer to the Commission of the function of reviewing and reporting on Dáil and European Parliament constituencies from Constituency Commissions.

The Commission is to carry out Dáil and/or European Parliament electoral boundary reviews. Constituency Commissions were previously established by Ministerial Order, following the publication of the preliminary result of a Census by the Central Statistics Office, or in certain circumstances where the number of European Parliament seats allocated to Ireland has been amended.

The Census-driven reviews are undertaken by the Commission following the publication of preliminary results without a need for Ministerial Order, reflecting the independence of the Commission and the organisational context for the function.

Reports

Electoral Reform Act 2022 sets out the types of reports which the Commission is required to prepare, having regard to the circumstances which triggered the review. It also specifies the matters which the Commission will have regard to in conducting reviews and preparing reports. The timelines for the Commission to present reports prepared under this chapter to the Joint Oireachtas Committee and lay same before the Houses of the Oireachtas are set out. It also provides that reports may state that no alteration of boundaries is required.

The public are to be informed of the Commission’s undertaking of a review under this chapter. The information is to be provided by the Commission in a public statement. There are particulars of how public submissions should be made and recorded and requiring that all such statements be considered by the Commission in its review.

Electoral Reform Act 2022 provides for the transfer of the function of reviewing and reporting on local electoral area boundaries from Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees to the Commission.

Role of Minister

Before the Minister amends local electoral area boundaries, he or she first requests the Commission to prepare a report and has regard to it when deciding to amend the boundary/boundaries. This has the effect of transferring the report-making function from Local Electoral Area Boundary Committees to the Commission.

The Minister may, in his/her request to the Commission set out matters to which the Commission will have regard to in preparing its report. These matters are subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. The section also requires local. authorities to provide the Commission with any information which it may need in preparing its report.

The Act sets out that the Minister specifies the timeframe for the delivery by the Commission of its report. The Commission gives public notice of its preparation of a report under this chapter, and that the Commission makes provisions for the public and stakeholders to make submissions on the review. It further requires that the Commission have regard to all submissions received.
