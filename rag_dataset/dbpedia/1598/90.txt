Àngel Planells (1901-1989) oil on canvas at the Art Institute of Chicago. Written near the painting: The Catalan artist Àngel Planells began training in 1917 to become an engraver, but after two and a half years, he turned his attention to painting. He was introduced to Surrealism through Salvador Dalí and René Magritte. In 1936 Planells exhibited three paintings, including Midday Sorrow, in the first International Surrealist Exhibition at the New Burlington Galleries in London, the foremost major exhibition to survey the history of the movement. The first owner of this painting was Roland Penrose, one of the primary organizers of the exhibition; an artist and poet, he was married to the Surrealist muse and photographer Lee Miller, and was a close friend of many Surrealist artists.
