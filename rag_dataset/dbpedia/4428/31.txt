The Dumfries firm faces a takeover from a Cumbrian company

A Dumfries firm looks set to be bought out by a Cumbrian-based agriculture supply group.

Carrs Billington has confirmed it is in talks to secure ownership of Johnston Fuels and Lubricants.

The proposed buy-out has still to be finalised but Carrs Billington's chief executive, Chris Holmes, confirmed negotiations were continuing.

The planned acquisition is part of plans by the Carlisle firm to establish a Scottish fuels division.

The firm's business portfolio already includes animal feed, machinery, fertiliser, agrochemicals and a range of other farming products.

Carrs Billington operates 14 branches serving the north of England, the Midlands and Scotland.

Johnstone Fuels and Lubricants, based at Dargavel Stores on the outskirts of Dumfries, was started up by local man Jimmy Johnston in 1993.

It currently employs 15 people, including the existing management team.
