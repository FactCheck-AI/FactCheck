Governance

The Scottish Fuel Poverty Advisory Panel was established as an Non-Departmental Public Body (NPDB) from 19th September 2019 under the Fuel Poverty (Scotland) Act 2019.

The Panel members were appointed into position from 1st January 2022.

The Panel provides independent expert advice to Scottish Ministers. It does not employ staff or hold a budget. The Scottish Government makes resources available to the Panel, including a dedicated secretariat, to ensure the Panel is able to undertake its role. Its members are appointed by Scottish Ministers.

The Framework document sets out the relationship between Ministers, the Scottish Government and the Panel.

We will publish this document in due course.
