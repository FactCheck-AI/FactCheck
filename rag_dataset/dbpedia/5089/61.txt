Jack Lemmon will join Matt Damon, Will Smith and Charlize Theron in Robert Redford’s “The Legend of Bagger Vance,” the period drama about a championship golfer who, upon his return from war, is offered a shot at redemption in a pro tournament.

Lemmon will narrate the story as the mature champion reflecting on that memorable summer.

Pic is in production in Georgia. Redford’s Wildwood Enterprises is producing along with Jake Eberts’ Allied Films.

Nominated eight times, Lemmon has taken home two Oscars during his career — for 1974’s “Save the Tiger,” and 1956’s “Mister Roberts.” He was also nominated for an Emmy this year for his performance in Showtime’s “Inherit the Wind” opposite the late George C. Scott.

Lemmon will next appear in the upcoming ABC/Oprah Winfrey Presents telepic “Tuesdays With Morrie,” based on the bestseller by Mitch Albom in which Lemmon stars in the title role. Pic is skedded to air on Dec. 5.

Lemmon is repped by CAA and Industry Entertainment.
