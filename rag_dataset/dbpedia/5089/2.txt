Biography

Jake Eberts, OC (July 10, 1941 â€“ September 6, 2012) was a Canadian film producer, executive and financier.

Born John David Eberts in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, he was the son of Elizabeth Evelyn (MacDougall), an interior decorator, and Edmond Howard Eberts, who worked for an aluminum manufacturer.

Jake Eberts trained as a chemical engineer at McGill University but found he wasn't very good at it. In 1966 he earned an MBA from Harvard University and worked on Wall Street for three years before joining an investment firm in London in 1971. He became interested in the film business in 1974 when he was approached to help finance the animated feature 'Watership Down', which went on to become a critical and box office success. He founded Goldcrest Films in the late 1970s. During the next four decades, he financed or produced more than 50 films, including four that won Academy Awards for best picture: 'Chariots of Fire' (1981), 'Gandhi' (1982), 'Driving Miss Daisy' (1989) and 'Dances With Wolves' (1990). He also produced 'The Killing Fields' (1984), 'City of Joy' (1992), 'The Legend of Bagger Vance' (2000) and the ecological documentary 'Oceans' (2009). During the past decade he began concentrating on developing nature-themed documentaries and collaborated with National Geographic on several projects.

In 1992 Eberts became an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was also awarded honorary doctorates by McGill University in 1998 and by Bishop's University in 1999. He served on the Board of the Sundance Institute and the Sundance Channel. He was also co-founder and CEO of MPI International, which provides high-speed, two-way video transmission capabilities to telcos, cable companies, hotels, hospitals, and schools.

By 2005, Eberts had been associated with films garnering 66 Oscar nominations, including nine for Best Picture. In 2006, March of the Penguins won the Oscar for Best Documentary.

In 2010, Eberts was diagnosed with uveal melanoma, a rare cancer of the eye, which had also spread to his liver.
