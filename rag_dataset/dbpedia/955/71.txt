Printmaker and designer Giovanni Battista Piranesi was born on 4 October 1720 in Mogliano near Mestre. Piranesi grew to rapid acclaim for his prints of ancient and contemporary Rome and his series of imaginary prisons. Famous for his views, real or imagined, Piranesi was known as the greatest “vedutista” (view-maker) in Rome by midcentury. He died on 9 November 1778 in Rome.
