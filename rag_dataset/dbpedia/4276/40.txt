North Light, winner of last year`s English Derby, has been sold to stand at Adena Springs, Kentucky. The son of Danehill has been at trainer Sir Michael Stoute`s Newmarket yard since his retirement was announced in June. Having passed a veterinary examination he is set to travel to his new home in a few weeks.

One of only a handful of Derby winners in recent times to remain in training at four, he was runner-up to New Morning in the Group 3 Brigadier Gerard Stakes on his seasonal bow in May before retiring less than a month later suffering a career ending stress fracture to his pelvis.

Adena Springs`s Frank Stronach, along with Irishman Michael Daly, has bought the four-year-old outright from his owner-breeders the Weinstock family in a deal brokered by Michael`s brother Edward Daly.

He represents the first Group 1 winning son of Danehill to stand in North America and is only the fourth Epsom Derby winner in the past twenty years to retire to stud there, the others being the ill-fated Benny The Dip (1997), Quest For Fame (1990) and the 1986 winner Shahrastani.

"Mr Stronach had been looking for a Danehill for a while, said Daly on Thursday, "and with an excellent family like his we think he represents a very good prospect to combine with the speed sires you get in North American.

"I`m absolutely thrilled for the horse; he`ll get the chance he richly deserves there. Mr Stronach doesn`t shuttle his horses and he`ll be supporting the horse with some of his best mares."

The same connections were also involved in shipping Robert Sangster`s top-juvenile El Prado to the States in 1993 � the first son of Sadler`s Wells to enter stud in the country. North Light and fellow 2005 retiree Ghostzapper will be among El Prado`s new stud companions at Adena Springs for next season.

Ballymacoll Stud manager Peter Reynolds said "We took a risk keeping in him in training at four and unfortunately it didn`t work, but what the hell, we`re in it for the racing.

"I`m pleased he`sgoing abroad, he`ll have a much better chance there than with National Hunt mares in Ireland and I wish them all the best."

North Light was bred and raced by Ballymacoll, winning three of seven starts and �1,097,276 in prize-money, the highlight being his length and-a-half defeat of the subsequent St Leger winner Rule Of Law at Epsom. His other successes were achieved in a maiden at Goodwood and in York`s Dante Stakes, the victory with which he earned his place in the Epsom line-up.

He failed to win another race after his Classic triumph, but finished second to Grey Swallow in the Irish Derby and fifth in the Arc.
