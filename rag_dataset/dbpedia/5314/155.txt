Where We Provide Care

The WTC Health Program provides care through multiple Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCE) and the Nationwide Provider Network (NPN).

The WTC Health Program only covers medically necessary healthcare services within the United States and its territories, including the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

Clinical Centers of Excellence

CCEs treat members in the NY metropolitan area. Responders, survivors, and FDNY have specific clinics.

Nationwide Provider Network

Care is provided in all US states and territories through the NPN. The NPN is a network of health care providers across the country under contract with the Program to provide care for members who live outside the NY metropolitan area.

Outreach is performed by outreach and education partners engaged with the 9/11 community and New York City neighborhoods.
