Years in the making as unsuspecting fans know, Four Fists, the collaborative project featuring Astronautalis and P.O.S. (Doomtree), will release the new album 6666 (Doomtree), which features 11 new tracks and will be released on October 12, 2018.

One of the first new songs released from 6666 was the brazen call-to-action anthem “Nobody’s Biz.”It’s an in-your-face kind of track that finds P.O.S and Astronautalis proudly dishing out their aggression towards the cops and just about anyone else who stands in their way.
