“Sadly, Jerry Miller passed away last night,” a post to the Moby Grape, the band with which Miller helped found in the 1960s, Facebook page read following his death. “Jo and the family are asking for everyone to please give them some privacy and respect, and Jo asked that people cease phone calls for the time being. Thank you.”

Miller, who was once called the “best guitarist in the world” by Eric Clapton, began performing in the 1950s and helped form Moby Grape starting in 1966.

Deadline reported that he toured with Bobby Fuller of “I Fought the Law,” fame and even did some “early guitar work” on that hit.

After leaving Moby Grape, Miller helped form The Rhythm Dukes and also performed as a solo artist.
