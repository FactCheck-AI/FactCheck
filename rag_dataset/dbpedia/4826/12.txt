The United States Mint first produced the Kennedy half dollars in 1964 a few months after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. The nation was in mourning after the assassination of this popular president. Congress moved quickly to pass a law (Public Law 88-256) to eliminate the Franklin half dollar design and create a coin to commemorate President John F. Kennedy. Gilroy Roberts created the portrait of Kennedy on the obverse and Frank Gasparro sculpted the heraldic eagle on the reverse based upon the Great Seal of the United States.

In 1964 Kennedy half dollars were made from 90% silver and 10% copper. Half dollars made from 1965 through 1970 are composed of two outer layers containing 80% silver and 20% copper with an inner core of 20.9% silver and 79.1% copper (net composition: 40% silver and 60% copper). Coins minted in 1971 and beyond have outer layers composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel bonded to an inner core of pure copper. The coin has a diameter of 30.6 mm and a reeded edge.
