Americast is a former cable provider brand.

History[]

Four individual communications companies; Ameritech, BellSouth, SBC Communications and GTE, as well as The Walt Disney Company, created the Americast brand in 1996, as a joint venture between the five, With SNET joining as a 6th partner.[1][2][3][4] Despite the brand being managed by six different companies, the name was derived mainly from the Ameritech brand.

The parent companies began to change, as SBC acquired both SNET and Ameritech in 1998 and 1999 respectively (though keeping both in operation as a subsidiary for some time after), and GTE merging with Bell Atlantic in 2000, creating a new company known as Verizon in the process.

BellSouth discontinued the service in 2000. SNET would follow suit the next year, with SBC/Americast selling their systems to competitor Wide Open West that same year.[5][6][7][8] Verizon (previously known as GTE), the last company to offer the Americast service, sold their systems to Knology in 2003.[9]
