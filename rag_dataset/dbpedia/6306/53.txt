Hartzell Propeller has acquired WhirlWind Propellers, expanding the former’s product portfolio into light-sport aircraft.

WhirlWind Propellers makes composite constant-speed and ground-adjustable propellers for the light-sport, experimental and unmanned aircraft markets. The Company also designs proof of concept propellers for emerging applications. Hartzell Propeller plans to retain the WhirlWind brand and product offerings.

JJ Frigge, president of Hartzell Propeller said, “The acquisition allows Hartzell to further expand WhirlWind’s rapid propeller development capabilities for the design, tooling and manufacturing of advanced carbon composite propellers.”

Hartzell will retain the services of Jim Rust, former President of WhirlWind Propellers. Rust’s technological expertise with rapid prototyping composite propeller systems further enhances Hartzell’s existing capabilities.

Rust added, “I am excited to be part of the Hartzell Propeller team and eager to see the WhirlWind brand continue to thrive under Hartzell’s leadership.”
