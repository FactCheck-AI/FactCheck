Founded in 1975, Catto Propellers has been providing cutting edge technology and high-quality manufacturing services for close to 50 years. We provide a wide variety of propellers for general aviation and specialize in custom propeller design and custom manufacturing to meet design requirements. Our experienced team and state-of-the-art equipment ensure that every project is completed to the highest standards.

At Catto Propellers we design and manufacture propellers for experimental, S-LSA and E-LSA aircraft. Majority of our propellers are fixed pitch but we have developed a hydraulic constant speed for the Berkut, Velocity, Cozy and Cub Type. We will be releasing more blade designs for other aircraft in the near future.

We provide structures and manufacturing for custom projects, including drones, EVTOL and more. Please inquire at info@cattoprops.com.
