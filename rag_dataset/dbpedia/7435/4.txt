In-park accommodations at Crater Lake Lodge, The Cabins at Mazama Village, and Mazama Campground are often fully booked months in advance. But there are plenty of options outside the park. Below is list of all the hotels and campgrounds within 35 miles of Steel Visitor Center and park headquarters. This list does not include bed-and-breakfasts, guest houses, and vacation rentals. The next closest options are in Chemult (42 miles away), Shady Cove (55 miles), Klamath Falls (57 miles), and there are many other lodging options beyond these.

Camping is prohibited in pullouts, picnic areas, and parking lots within the park. Overnighting is allowed only for registered guests at the lodge, cabins, and campgrounds, and for backpackers who obtain a permit.
