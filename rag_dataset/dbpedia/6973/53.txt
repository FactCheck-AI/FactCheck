We just learned that Peter Yates, director of the incredible The Friends Of Eddie Coyle, Bullitt, and Krull, has passed away.

Deadline just posted this story, attributing his death to an unnamed illness that Yates had suffered from. I’m sure we’ll know more tomorrow as more information is made available.

While you can’t currently stream Friends Of Eddie Coyle (we’ll be covering the film very soon on the podcast) on Netflix Watch Instantly, they do currently have all of these available to watch right now, if you’re in the mood to celebrate this fantastic director, and remember him fondly:
