TORONTO — Helmers Julia Kwan and Stephane Lapointe will share the Claude Jutra Award at the upcoming Genies, Canada’s top film honors, the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television said Wednesday.

The tribute to first-time directorial achievement will go to Vancouver-based Kwan for “Eve and the Fire Horse,” which earned the special jury prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, and to Quebec filmmaker Lapointe for “La Vie secrete des gens heureux,” (The Secret Life of Happy People).

“Eve and the Fire Horse” portrays a young girl who uses her imagination to change her family’s fate, while “La Vie secrete des gens heureux” captures the drama of a university student struggling to live up to his parents’ dreams for him.

Past winners of the Claude Jutra Award include Robert Lepage, Thom Fitzgerald, Zacharias Kunuk and Keith Behrman.
