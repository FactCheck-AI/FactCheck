Canadian twin pop duo Tegan and Sara are loving the amount of gay male singers conquering pop music, but they want to see more lesbian women.

“It’s wonderful to see people like Troye Sivan, Years & Years and Sam Smith, and there have been lots of really amazing trailblazing women who have been champions of the queer community like Madonna and Lady Gaga and Katy Perry,” Sara told the New York Times.

“But it does feel like, ‘Man, can we get some queer ladies up in this joint?’”

She explained that after years of only being able to connect to “young, queer girl crowds” the duo feel like with their new album Love You To Death they’re finally getting through to others.

“I think that the second people find out a woman is gay, it sort of makes their voice, or their value, very specific and very ‘other,’” Sara said.

“I think that’s continuing to change, and I think we are feeling, especially right now with [new single] ‘Boyfriend,’ this is the first time in our career where I’m getting a lot of men saying to me like, ‘I totally relate to this song.’ And I’m completely surprised.”
