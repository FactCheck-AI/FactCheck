To conclude BDF Conference 2021 we’re delighted to welcome 3 speakers who share a passion for colour as an expression of emotion and personality.

Through the conference Vito hub, we’ll be sharing three 30 minute films from our speakers, followed by a live Q&A where you can pose questions in the live chat.
