Abstract

The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as ‘High risk plants, plant products and other objects’. This Scientific Opinion covers plant health risks posed by dormant grafted plants, rootstocks, budwood and scions of Malus domestica imported from Turkey, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Turkey. All pests associated with the commodities were evaluated against specific criteria for their relevance for this opinion. Three quarantine pests (Anoplophora chinensis, Lopholeucaspis japonica and tomato ringspot virus), one protected zone quarantine pest (Erwinia amylovora) and eight non‐regulated pests (Calepitrimerus baileyi, Cenopalpus irani, Cicadatra persica, Diplodia bulgarica, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Malacosoma parallela, Pratylenchus loosi and Pyrolachnus pyri) that fulfilled all relevant criteria were selected for further evaluation. For E. amylovora, special requirements are specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072. Based on the information provided in the dossier, the specific requirements for E. amylovora were not met. For Anoplophora chinensis, special measures are specified in Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2012/138. The exporting country does meet the requirement for a certificate regarding plants for planting that originate from Turkish provinces other than Istanbul. For the 10 remaining selected pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Turkey were evaluated taking into account the possible limiting factors. For the selected pests an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The degree of pest freedom varies among the pests evaluated, with D. bulgarica being the pest most frequently expected on the imported plants. The expert knowledge elicitation indicated with 95% certainty that between 9,863 and 10,000 bundles (consisting of 10 or 25 plants each) per 10,000 would be free from D. bulgarica.

1. Introduction

1.1. Background and Terms of Reference as provided by European Commission

1.1.1. Background

The new Plant Health Regulation (EU) 2016/2031 1 , on the protective measures against pests of plants, has been applied from December 2019. Provisions within the above Regulation are in place for the listing of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ (Article 42) on the basis of a preliminary assessment, and to be followed by a commodity risk assessment. A list of ‘high risk plants, plant products and other objects’ has been published in Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 2 . Scientific opinions are therefore needed to support the European Commission and the Member States in the work connected to Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031, as stipulated in the terms of reference.

1.1.2. Terms of Reference

In view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 3 , the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinions in the field of plant health.

In particular, EFSA is expected to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in the relevant Implementing Act as "High risk plants, plant products and other\objects". Article 42, paragraphs 4 and 5, establishes that a risk assessment is needed as a follow‐up to evaluate whether the commodities will remain prohibited, removed from the list and additional measures will be applied or removed from the list without any additional measures. This task is expected to be on‐going, with a regular flow of dossiers being sent by the applicant required for the risk assessment.

Therefore, to facilitate the correct handling of the dossiers and the acquisition of the required data for the commodity risk assessment, a format for the submission of the required data for each dossier is needed.

Furthermore, a standard methodology for the performance of "commodity risk assessment" based on the work already done by Member States and other international organizations needs to be set.

In view of the above and in accordance with Article 29 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002, the Commission asks EFSA to provide scientific opinion in the field of plant health for M. domestica from Turkey taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical dossier provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey.

1.2. Interpretation of the Terms of Reference

The EFSA Panel on Plant Health (hereafter referred to as ‘the Panel’) was requested to conduct a commodity risk assessment of Malus domestica from Turkey following the Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019a).

The EU quarantine pests that are regulated as a group in the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 were considered and evaluated separately at species level.

Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 lists certain pests as non‐European populations or isolates or species. These pests are regulated quarantine pests. Consequently, the respective European populations, or isolates, or species are non‐regulated pests.

Annex VII of the same Regulation, in certain cases (e.g. point 32) makes reference to the following countries that are excluded from the obligation to comply with specific import requirements for those non‐European populations, or isolates, or species: Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canary Islands, Faeroe Islands, Georgia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Russia (only the following parts: Central Federal District (Tsentralny federalny okrug), Northwestern Federal District (Severo Zapadny federalny okrug), Southern Federal District (Yuzhny federalny okrug), North Caucasian Federal District (Severo‐Kavkazsky federalny okrug) and Volga Federal District (Privolzhsky federalny okrug), San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom (except Northern Ireland 4 )). Those countries are historically linked to the reference to ‘non‐European countries’ existing in the previous legal framework, Directive 2000/29/EC.

Consequently, for those countries,

any pests identified, which are listed as non‐European species in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 should be investigated as any other non‐regulated pest.

any pest found in a European country that belongs to the same denomination as the pests listed as non‐European populations or isolates in Annex II of Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, should be considered as European populations or isolates and should not be considered in the assessment of those countries.

Pests listed as ‘Regulated Non‐Quarantine Pest' (RNQP)’ in Annex IV of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, and deregulated pests (i.e. pest which were listed as quarantine pests in the Council Directive 2000/29/EC and were deregulated by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) were not considered for further evaluation.

In its evaluation the Panel:

Checked whether the information provided by the applicant (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey) in the technical dossier (hereafter referred to as ‘the Dossier’) was sufficient to conduct a commodity risk assessment. When necessary, additional information was requested to the applicant.

Selected the relevant union EU‐regulated quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (as specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 5 , hereafter referred to as ‘EU quarantine pests’) and other relevant pests present in Turkey and associated with the commodity.

Assessed whether or not the applicant country implements specific measures for Union quarantine pests for which specific measures are in place for the import of the commodity from the specific country in the relevant legislative texts for emergency measures (https://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/plant_health_biosecurity/legislation/emergency_measures_en); the assessment was restricted to whether or not the applicant country applies those measures. The effectiveness of those measures was not assessed.

Assessed whether the applicant country implements the special requirements specified in Annex VII (points 1–101) and Annex X of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 targeting Union quarantine pests for the commodity in question from the specific country.

Assessed the effectiveness of the measures described in the dossier for those Union quarantine pests for which no specific measures are in place for the import of the commodity from the specific applicant country and other relevant pests present in applicant country and associated with the commodity.

Risk management decisions are not within EFSA’s remit. Therefore, the Panel provided a rating based on expert judgement regarding the likelihood of pest freedom for each relevant pest given the risk mitigation measures claimed to be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey.

2. Data and methodologies

2.1. Data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey

The Panel considered all the data and information (hereafter called ‘the Dossier’) provided by Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey in November 2019, including the additional information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey in December 2020 and in August 2021, after EFSA’s request. The Dossier is managed by EFSA.

The structure and overview of the Dossier is shown in Table . The number of the relevant section is indicated in the opinion when referring to a specific part of the Dossier.

The data and supporting information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey formed the basis of the commodity risk assessment.

Table shows the main data sources used by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Republic of Turkey to compile the Dossier (details on literature searches can be found in the Dossier Section 2.0).

2.2. Literature searches performed by EFSA

Literature searches in different databases were undertaken by EFSA to complete a list of pests potentially associated with M. domestica. The following searches were combined: (i) a general search to identify pests of M. domestica in different databases and (ii) a tailored search to identify whether these pests are present or not in Turkey and the EU. The searches were run between 24 January 2021 and 22 April 2021. No language, date or document type restrictions were applied in the search strategy.

The search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each of the databases listed in Table , according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and CABI keyword thesaurus.

As for Web of Science, the literature search was performed using a specific, ad hoc established search string (see Appendix B). The string was run in ‘All Databases’ with no range limits for time or language filters. This is further explained in Section 2.3.2.

Additional searches, limited to retrieve documents, were run when developing the opinion. The available scientific information, including previous EFSA opinions on the relevant pests and diseases (see pest data sheets in Appendix A) and the relevant literature and legislation (e.g. Regulation (EU) 2016/2031; Commission Implementing Regulations (EU) 2018/2019; (EU) 2018/2018 and (EU) 2019/2072) were taken into account.

2.3. Methodology

When developing the opinion, the Panel followed the EFSA Guidance on commodity risk assessment for the evaluation of high‐risk plant dossiers (EFSA PLH Panel, 2019a).

In the first step, pests potentially associated with the commodity in the country of origin (EU‐quarantine pests and other pests) that may require risk mitigation measures were identified. The EU non‐quarantine pests not known to occur in the EU were selected based on evidence of their potential impact in the EU. After the first step, all the relevant pests that may need risk mitigation measures were identified.

In the second step, the proposed risk mitigation measures for each relevant pest were evaluated in terms of efficacy or compliance with EU requirements as explained in Section 1.2.

A conclusion on the likelihood of the commodity being free from each of the relevant pest was determined and uncertainties identified using expert judgements.

Pest freedom was assessed by estimating the number of infested/infected bundles out of 10,000 exported bundles of 10–25 plants each.

2.3.1. Commodity data

Based on the information provided by Turkey the characteristics of the commodity were summarised.

2.3.2. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity

To evaluate the pest risk associated with the importation of M. domestica from Turkey a pest list was compiled. The pest list is a compilation of all identified plant pests associated with M. domestica based on information provided in the Dossier Sections 1, 2, 3 and on searches performed by the Panel. The search strategy and search syntax were adapted to each of the databases listed in Table , according to the options and functionalities of the different databases and CABI keyword thesaurus.

The scientific names of the host plants (i.e. Malus domestica) were used when searching in the EPPO Global database and CABI Crop Protection Compendium. The same strategy was applied to the other databases excluding EUROPHYT and Web of Science.

EUROPHYT was consulted by searching for the interceptions associated to commodities imported from Turkey, at the species level, from 1994 to May 2020 and TRACES for interceptions from May 2020 to March 2022. For the pests selected for further evaluation a search in the EUROPHYT and/or TRACES was performed for the interceptions from the whole world, at the species level.

The search strategy used for Web of Science Databases was designed combining common names for pests and diseases, terms describing symptoms of plant diseases and the scientific and common names of the commodity. All the pests already retrieved using the other databases were removed from the search terms in order to be able to reduce the number of records to be screened.

The established search string is detailed in Appendix B and was run on 12 April 2021.

The titles and abstracts of the scientific papers retrieved were screened and the pests associated with M. domestica were included in the pest list. The pest list was eventually further compiled with other relevant information (e.g. EPPO code per pest, taxonomic information, categorisation, distribution) useful for the selection of the pests relevant for the purposes of this opinion.

The compiled pest list (see Microsoft Excel® filename in Appendix D) includes all identified pests that use M. domestica as host. According to the Interpretation of Terms of Reference.

The evaluation of the compiled pest list was done in two steps: first, the relevance of the EU‐quarantine pests was evaluated (Section 4.1); second, the relevance of any other plant pest was evaluated (Section 4.2).

Pests for which limited information was available on one or more criteria used to identify them as relevant for this opinion, e.g. on potential impact, are listed in Appendix C (List of pests that can potentially cause an effect not further assessed).

2.3.3. Listing and evaluation of risk mitigation measures

All proposed risk mitigation measures were listed and evaluated. When evaluating the likelihood of pest freedom at origin, the following types of potential infection sources for M. domestica in nurseries were considered (see also Figure ):

pest entry from surrounding areas,

pest entry with new plants/seeds,

pest spread within the nursery.

The risk mitigation measures adopted in the plant nurseries (as communicated by Turkey) were evaluated with expert knowledge elicitation (EKE) according to the Guidance on uncertainty analysis in scientific assessment (EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018).

Information on the biology, estimates of likelihood of entry of the pest to the nursery and spread within the nursery, and the effect of the measures on a specific pest were summarised in pest data sheets compiled for each pest selected for further evaluation (see Appendix A).

2.3.4. Expert knowledge elicitation

To estimate the pest freedom of the commodity an EKE was performed following EFSA guidance (Annex B.8 of EFSA Scientific Committee, 2018).

The specific question for EKE was: ‘Taking into account (i) the risk mitigation measures in place in the nurseries, and (ii) other relevant information, how many of 10,000 bundles of M. domestica will be infested/infected with the relevant pest/pathogen when arriving in the EU?’. A bundle can contain from 10 to 25 plants.

The risk assessment uses bundles of 10–25 bare‐rooted plants or scions/budwood, as the most suitable unit. The following reasoning is given:

There is no quantitative information available regarding clustering of plants during production;

Plants are grouped in bundles of 10–25 after sorting;

For the pests under consideration, a cross‐contamination during transport is possible.

The EKE question was common to all pests for which the pest freedom of the commodity was estimated.

The uncertainties associated with the EKE were taken into account and quantified in the probability distribution applying the semi‐formal method described in Section 3.5.2 of the EFSA‐PLH Guidance on quantitative pest risk assessment (EFSA PLH Panel, 2018). Finally, the results were reported in terms of the likelihood of pest freedom. The lower 5% percentile of the uncertainty distribution reflects the opinion that pest freedom is with 95% certainty above this limit.

3. Commodity data

3.1. Description of the commodity

The commodities to be imported are grafted plants, rootstocks, budwood and scions of M. domestica Borkh (common name: apple; family: Rosaceae). There are several apple rootstocks and varieties i.e. M7, M9, M26, M27, MM104, MM106, MM109, MM111, B9, G41, G935, Erva, Regalstar, Regalyou and Vita. The growing conditions are both field grown and grown in containers outside (pots, tubs). There are two types of grafts for the apple plants for propagation, clonal rootstocks planted at the nursery in February and bud‐grafted in August, and clonal rootstocks bench grafted (bare‐rooted grafted) and then planted in March. Grafted plants and rootstocks are bare rooted and without leaves. Budwood and scions are without leaves.

The commodities for export are the following types of M. domestica plants:

If whip and tongue grafting is used, the plants are grown for an additional 7‐ to 12‐month period. If T‐budding is used, the plants are grown for an additional 17‐ to 19‐month‐period.

Rootstocks are 8‐month‐old.

Budwood are 4‐ to 5‐month‐old.

Scions are 10‐ to 12‐month‐old.

The diameter of the exported grafted plants is 2.5–3 cm (Dossier, Section 3).

The assessment performed assumes that the characteristics of the commodity are as described above. According to ISPM 36 (FAO, 2019), the commodity can be classified as bare‐rooted plants for planting and budwood/graftwood.

3.2. Description of the production areas

The plants designated for export are grown in 30 different provinces in Turkey. The production is mainly concentrated in Isparta, Nigde, Bursa, Izmir and Konya provinces (Figure ). Based on the global Köppen–Geiger climate zone classification (Kottek et al., 2006), the climate of these main production areas of M. domestica in Turkey, in particular Bursa, Isparta and Izmir provinces, is classified as Csa, main climate (C): temperate; (s): dry Summer;(a): hot Summer (Mediterranean climate). For Konya and Nigde provinces, the climate type is classified as Bsk, main climate (B): arid; (s: steppe;(k): cold.

3.3. Production and handling processes

3.3.1. Growing conditions

Prior to the establishment of the production sites, soil samples are taken and examined for the presence of quarantine organisms (e.g. root knot nematodes, etc.). Mother plants are subject to official control each year in spring, summer and autumn in terms of phytosanitary status. Phytosanitary inspectors check mother plants for the presence of harmful organisms. The production of plants is carried out in open field area.

Scions and budwood are taken from mother plants undergone control and supervision of the Ministry Provincial Directorate. This phytosanitary control is carried out on mother plants in spring, summer and autumn.

There are two different types of grafting for apple young plant propagation.

Clonal rootstocks are planted at the nursery in February and then bud‐grafted in August of the same year. Young plants are taken from the soil in November of the next year. Young plants are ready for delivery in 21 months from the planting of rootstock (Figure ).

Clonal rootstocks are bench‐grafted and then planted at the nursery in March. Young plants are removed from the soil in November of the same year. Young plants are ready for delivery in 8 months.

3.3.2. Source of planting material

The propagation material (budwood, rootstocks, buds and scions) is obtained from the producer's own or another producer’s mother block. The mother blocks are under the control and supervision of the Ministry Provincial Directorate experts. The inspection and certification of the sapling and the propagation material is made by the Ministry experts. Before the establishment of mother block, soil sample is taken by the official inspector from the area subjected to official analysis in terms of quarantine organisms. The mother block can be established in the area determined to be free from quarantine organisms as a result of the analysis and basic certified saplings are planted in the area.

3.3.3. Production cycle

Before sapling production, an officer takes soil samples from the parcel for analysis for nematodes by the Ministry quarantine agency. If it is free from nematodes, production may begin. Before the rootstock planting, burnt animal manure, ammonium sulfate and urea fertiliser are applied to the growing area or mortar. In February, apple clonal rootstocks are planted in the sapling production parcel. During planting, Nogall application is made to protect against crown gall and rootstocks are planted. NPK fertilisers, humic acid, fulvic acid, organic fertilisers and plant growth regulators are applied to rootstocks and grafted plants through foliar or irrigation water. Plants are also sprayed against aphids, thrips, whiteflies, red spider pests, black spot, powdery mildew, root rot diseases and, depending on the situation, to control weeds. Grafting takes place in August or September. Bare‐rooted saplings are pulled out from the soil in dormant season.

For scions and budwood destined to the export, plant material is taken at the appropriate age (see Section 3.1). Apple fruit trees propagating material are produced under a certification scheme.

3.3.4. Pest monitoring during production

Official visual inspection is conducted at least once or twice a year during production or during uprooting of the plants. Visual inspection can be supported by the use of microscope or laboratory analysis if pests are suspected to be present; no further details were provided.

3.3.5. Post‐harvest processes and export procedure

Before the export, the plants are washed with water and their roots are cleaned from soil. Washed plants are labelled by making bundles of 10 or 25. In order to prevent water loss from the roots, before loading, the bundles are immersed in a solution of fosetyl‐al and then loaded. Official controls before export are carried out by the Ministry quarantine inspector. A phytosanitary certificate is issued to the saplings that are found suitable. Apple saplings are kept in cold storage at 98% humidity ± 2–4°C until the day they are marketed. Rootstocks to be exported are handled in a similar manner.

Scions and budwood are taken from the same mother plants that are used to produce the grafted plants, bundled and exported. The size of the bundles of scions and budwood was not specified, but we assume the same number of units per bundle as for rootstocks and grafted plants. No further details were available on handling and packing.

4. Identification of pests potentially associated with the commodity

The search for potential pests associated to M. domestica rendered 1,118 species (see Microsoft Excel® file in Appendix D).

4.1. Selection of relevant EU‐quarantine pests associated with the commodity

The EU listing of union quarantine pests and protected zone quarantine pests (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072) is based on assessments concluding that the pests can enter, establish, spread and have potential impact in the EU.

Forty‐two EU‐quarantine species that are reported to use M. domestica as a host plant were evaluated (Table ) for their relevance of being included in this opinion.

The relevance of an EU‐quarantine pest for this opinion was based on evidence that:

the pest is present in Turkey.

M. domestica is a host of the pest.

one or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity.

Pests that fulfilled all criteria were selected for further evaluation.

Table presents an overview of the evaluation of the 42 EU‐quarantine pest species that are reported to use M. domestica as a host in regards of their relevance for this Opinion.

Two species, known to use M. domestica as host, associated with the commodity and present in Turkey (Lopholeucaspis japonica, tomato ringspot virus) were selected for further evaluation.

Since special requirements or emergency measures are specified for Malus domestica with regards to Erwinia amylovora and Anoplophora chinensis, in Appendix X, item 9 of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 and Commission Implementing Regulation 2012/138/EU, respectively, the evaluation for these pests consisted of checking whether or not the exporting country applies these measures.

4.2. Selection of other relevant pests (non‐regulated in the EU) associated with the commodity

The information provided by Turkey, integrated with the search EFSA performed, was evaluated in order to assess whether there are other potentially relevant pests of M. domestica present in the country of export. For these potential pests that are non‐regulated in the EU, pest risk assessment information on the probability of entry, establishment, spread and impact is usually lacking. Therefore, these pests were also evaluated to determine their relevance for this opinion based on evidence that:

the pest is present in Turkey;

the pest is (i) absent or (ii) has a limited distribution in the EU;

M. domestica is a host of the pest;

one or more life stages of the pest can be associated with the specified commodity;

the pest may have an impact in the EU.

Pests that fulfilled the above listed criteria were selected for further evaluation.

Pest species were excluded from further evaluation when at least one of the conditions listed above (a‐e) was not met. Details can be found in the Appendix D (Microsoft Excel® file).

Of the evaluated pests not regulated in the EU, Calepitrimerus baileyi, Cenopalpus irani, Cicadatra persica, Diplodia bulgarica, Hoplomaimus galeatus, Malocosoma parallela, Pratylenchus loosi, Pyrolachnus pyri, were selected for further evaluation because these met all the selection criteria. More information on these pests can be found in the pest datasheets (Appendix A).

4.3. Overview of interceptions

Data on the interception of harmful organisms on plants of M. domestica can provide information on some of the organisms that can be present on M. domestica despite the current measures taken. According to EUROPHYT, online (accessed on March 2022) and TRACES‐NT, online (accessed on March 2022), there were no interceptions of plants for planting of M. domestica from Turkey destined to the EU Member States due to presence of harmful organisms between the years 1994 and March 2022.

4.4. List of potential pests not further assessed

The Panel highlighted one species (Phytophthora rosacearum) for which the distribution within the EU is uncertain, since it may be identified as Phytophthora megasperma in the past. The Panel also identified Colletotrichum siamense as a potential pest, but this was based on a single report of the fungus from banana in a ripening room (Appendix C).

4.5. Summary of pests selected for further evaluation

The 10 pests identified to be present in Turkey while having potential for association with the commodities destined for export are listed in Table . The effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures applied to the commodity was evaluated for 10 of these selected pests (Calepitrimerus baileyi, Cenopalpus irani, Cicadatra persica, Diplodia bulgarica, Hoplomaimus galeatus, Lopholeucaspis japonica, Malocosoma parallela, Pratylenchus loosi, Pyrolachnus pyri and tomato ringspot virus).

5. Risk mitigation measures

For the 10 selected pests (Table ), the Panel assessed the possibility that they could be present in a M. domestica nursery and assessed the probability that pest freedom of a consignment is achieved by the proposed risk mitigation measures acting on the pest under evaluation.

The information used in the evaluation of the effectiveness of the risk mitigation measures is summarised in a pest data sheet (see Appendix A).

5.1. Possibility of pest presence in the export nurseries

For these 10 pests (Table ), the Panel evaluated the likelihood that the pest could be present in a M. domestica nursery by evaluating the possibility that M. domestica in the export nursery are infested either by:

introduction of the pest from the environment surrounding the nursery;

introduction of the pest with new plants/seeds;

spread of the pest within the nursery.

5.2. Risk mitigation measures applied in Turkey

With the information provided by Turkey (Dossier sections 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0), the Panel summarised the risk mitigation measures (see Table ) that are proposed in the production nurseries.

Table 6

No.Risk mitigation measure (name)Implementation in Turkey1Certified material

The Ministerial experts and inspectors carry out the phytosanitary control on mother plants in spring, summer and autumn for harmful organisms, and the amount of propagation materials (buds, budwoods, rootstocks, scions, etc.) that can be obtained from mother plants is determined. For the saplings, the phytosanitary control is also carried out at the same time, regarding harmful organisms specified in quarantine and plant passports, and certification regulations.

Rootstocks from certified plants are grafted with certified budwood or scions in a certified nursery. If free from the harmful organisms, the Ministry issues certificates and labels for the propagation material to be taken from plants in the mother blocks.

2Phytosanitary certificates

Export nurseries must obtain special certification from Turkish Authorities before they begin producing plants for planting. Nurseries must notify technical staff members responsible for production to obtain this certificate, which is then used for registration in the Turkish plant certification system.

The phytosanitary inspections are done macroscopically. However, if there are signs of disease in the plants or in the immediate vicinity, the inspections are carried out by laboratory analysis.

During the production period, official inspection is carried out. After the official approval that the sapling is free from the quarantine factor and true to type, its certificate‐passport label is issued by the Ministry.

The Phytosanitary Certificates/Re‐Export Phytosanitary Certificates are issued in exportation of plants and plant products with respect to plant health. In issuing such certificates, the phytosanitary requirements of the importer country are taken into account, in compliance with the ISPM No: 7 and ISPM No: 12 rules.

3Cleaning and disinfection of facilities, tools and machineryTools are disinfested with chemical compounds containing 10% chlorine prior to use.4Rouging and pruningApplied in case of infections/infestations. No further details are available.5Biological and mechanical control

Weeds are controlled mechanically in the nurseries and in the surrounding areas.

During rootstocks planting, Nogall (biological control agent) is applied to protect against crown gall.

6Pesticide application

The saplings are sprayed against aphids, thrips, whiteflies, red spider pests, black spot, powdery mildew, root rot diseases and, depending on the situation, to control weeds.

Before loading the plants on the trucks for transport, the roots of seedlings are sprayed with fungicide (Thiram).

No specific details were available.

7Surveillance and monitoring

Both processes are conducted by Turkish inspectors according to Turkish phytosanitary regulations. According to the dossier, necessary precautions are taken to ensure that there are no plants other than certified saplings in the production plot and application areas. Plants within and around the production areas are annually inspected to check the presence of quarantine organisms. Visual inspection at least once or twice a year during production or during uprooting of the plants. Visual inspection can be supported by the use of microscope or laboratory analysis if pests are suspected to be present.

In the event that these plants are infected/infested with harmful organisms subject to quarantine, in Turkey these plants are destroyed.

8Sampling and laboratory testing

For the identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes in the seedlings to be exported, min. 5 to max. 25 seedlings are randomly taken from the plantation in the nursery garden and sealed by the inspector and sent to the laboratory for analysis.

Soil samples are taken for laboratory analysis in terms of quarantine organisms, particularly to check if it is free from nematodes. If it is found that the soil is free from nematodes and other quarantine organisms, the production of saplings is started.

9Root washingRoots are washed to remove the soil10RefrigerationThe temperature of the storage tanks is between 2°C and 4°C and the humidity is 85–95%. Transportation is made with refrigerated trucks with the same conditions.11Pre‐consignment inspectionPrior to export, planting material for which a Phytosanitary Certificate is to be issued shall be subjected to phytosanitary inspection. Only certified plants for planting may be exported. Phytosanitary inspectors are responsible for export controls, sampling and issuing certificates.

5.3. Evaluation of the current measures for the selected relevant pests including uncertainties

For each evaluated pest the relevant risk mitigation measures acting on the pest were identified. Any limiting factors on the effectiveness of the measures were documented.

All the relevant information including the related uncertainties deriving from the limiting factors used in the evaluation are summarised in a pest data sheet provided in Appendix A.

Based on this information, for each selected relevant pest, an expert judgement is given for the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures and their combination acting on the pest.

An overview of the evaluation of each relevant pest is given in the sections below (Sections 5.3.1–5.3.10). The outcome of the EKE regarding pest freedom after the evaluation of the proposed risk mitigation measures is summarised in the Section 5.3.11.

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest could become associate with the commodity

C. baileyi deutogynes hibernate mainly in small, permanently dormant buds and under the loose bark of spurs and around buds on 1‐year‐old shoots.

Malus domestica is a host of the pest and the species can complete its life cycle on this host, however sometimes this species is vagrant surviving on the leaves.

The most possible way to spread is through the introduction of plant materials, as the mite can be found in buds, even in resting ones. There is no reference in the literature regarding the possibility of fruit being a pathway. There are no data on the active dispersal capacity of the pest.

It is present in Turkey with some details on its distribution, however there is no C. baileyi pest‐free area in Turkey.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Roguing and pruning, (iii) Pesticide application, (iv) Natural biological control, (v) Refrigeration and (vi) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Visual inspection especially in the case of low infestations without using an adequate magnification considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles. Phytoseiid species are reported preying on this species. They can be present in the environment though no details are provided in the dossier. Chemical applications can affect biological control agents. Some of the pesticides listed in the dossier might be effective against the mite, specifically acrinathrin and abamectin. However, no details are given on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods. Low storage temperature can prevent or slow down the development of the pest but will not eliminate it.

Main uncertainties

– It is unclear whether the pesticides are applied on a calendar basis or following ad hoc application as function of pest presence, or both

– Screening of certified material for this pest could not ensure pest absence because of the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest could become associate with the commodity

Cenopalpus irani is phytophagous, and has been reported on apple, pear, olive, walnut, quince, grapevine, sour cherry, plum, peach, fig and pistachio. It is widely distributed in apple orchards and one of the most important tenuipalpid pests on apple in Iran. C. irani feeds on stems, fruits, flowers, and leaves, often on the lower surface.

Possible pathways of entry for C. irani are plants for planting since these mites overwinter in branches. It can spread by wind currents and longer distance dispersion can occur by transportation of planting material.

It is reported as present in Turkey with no further details on its distribution.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Cleaning and disinfection of facilities, tools and machinery, (iii) Roguing and pruning, (iv) Pesticide application, (v) Natural biological control, (vi) Refrigeration and (vii) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Potential C. irani infestations might be overlooked by visual inspection especially in the case of low infestations without using an adequate magnification considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults (ca. 0.3 mm length) and juveniles (ca. 0.2 mm length). The main predators in apple orchards belong to the families Phytoseiidae and Stigmaeidae. They can be present in the environment though no details are provided in the dossier. Some of the pesticides listed in the dossier might be effective against the mite, specifically acrinathrin and abamectin. However, no details are given on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods. Low storage temperature can prevent or slow down the development of the pest but will not eliminate it.

Main uncertainties

• It is unclear whether the pesticides are applied on a calendar basis or following ad hoc application as function of pest presence, or both

• Screening of certified material for this pest could not ensure pest absence because of the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest could become associate with the commodity

The only host reported is Malus domestica. Eggs are laid in small twigs and nymphs feed on the roots.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Roguing and pruning, (iii) Pesticide application, (iv) Refrigeration and (v) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

In the EUROPHYT/TRACES NT database, there are /no interceptions of C. persica on plants for planting from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Visual detection of pest presence is difficult, due to egg laying inside stems and small branches. This causes twigs to split and die, causing a symptom called flagging which is also due to other pests. To confirm that a plant is infested by C. persica and not by another pests, it is essential to identify the species by morphological or molecular analyses.

Chemical control of eggs and nymphs is usually not very effective because the eggs are laid inside tissue and the nymphs stay in the soil.

No details are given on which pesticides are applied from those listed in Dossier, Section 2.0 on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods.

Low temperatures can slow down its development but not kill the insect.

Main uncertainties

– Eggs can be overlooked

– Symptoms may be misclassified with other pests

– The insecticide applications are not targeted to C. persica and may not be effective

Possibility that the pest could become associate with the commodity

D. bulgarica was detected for the first time in 2021 in M. domestica in Turkey. It causes a severe canker disease on M. domestica in several other countries.

It is possible that local populations of D. bulgarica are present in the neighbouring environment of the nursery with plants destined for export.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The primary measures taken in Turkey that would be effective against D. bulgarica include the use of certified material, regular inspections, and the use of pesticides.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

There are no main shortcomings.

Main uncertainties

Pest pressure and the proximity of population sources in the surrounding environment is unknown. Efficacy of surveillance of the nursery and mother plants is not known.

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest/pathogen could enter exporting nurseries

Hoplolaimus galeatus is a polyphagous, migratory endoparasite that occurs in both soil and roots and feeds on the cortical and vascular tissue of host plants. It can also be found as an ectoparasite. The nematode is widely distributed in the USA and parasitises various crops, grasses and woody plants. It has also been found in Canada, Sumatra, India, Tanzania, Central and South America, Pakistan, Australia, Spain and Turkey.

H. galeatus is a serious pest in native lawns and golf courses and can also be very damaging to many crops, such as cotton, soybean, alfalfa, and corn. It has also been reported as a problem in some orchards (apple, cherry and peach trees) in Michigan, USA.

In Turkey, H. galeatus has been found on sweet chestnut, cowpea, sesame, vegetable, kidney bean, plum, peach, olive, sunflower and apple. According to data available, the nematode has been reported in four regions (Antalya, Isparta, Sinop, Eskisehir) (Kepenekci, 2001, 2002; Kepenekci & Zeki, 2002). So far, no epidemics or economic losses have been reported in Turkey.

The main pathways of this nematode are infested plants for planting, contaminated water, soil and growing media as such or attached to plants, agricultural machinery, tools and shoes. This nematode can be found in the roots of apple plants or other host plants in the environment and infest the commodity mainly through human‐assisted dispersal.

Measures taken against the pest/pathogen and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Sampling and laboratory testing, (iii) Selection of production sites, (iv) Removal of soil from roots (washing), and (v) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Lance nematodes (Hoplolaimus spp.) are not on the list of harmful organisms systematically monitored or tested for their presence on plants intended for planting in Turkey. Soil and plants are tested in the laboratory only for the presence of root‐knot and virus vector nematodes, but not for the presence of Hoplolaimus spp. The undetected presence of this nematode during inspections may contribute to the spread of H. galeatus infection. In addition, pre‐export root washing does not reduce the risk of nematode infestation in plants intended for planting that are infested with lance nematodes (migratory endoparasites).

Main uncertainties

• Soil is laboratory tested only for the presence of root‐knot and virus vector nematodes, but not for the presence of Hoplolaimus spp.

• Symptoms caused by H. galeatus may be overlooked.

• Presence of H. galeatus cannot be detected.

• Root washing does not reduce the risk of nematodes (migratory endoparasites) infestation in plants intended for planting.

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest could become associated with the commodity

Lopholeucaspis japonica is a polyphagous armoured scale that feeds on plants belonging to 38 families, with Malus domestica being reported as a host.

Crawlers can be dispersed by wind or insects (ants, flies and ladybirds), occasionally also by human transport.

Plants for planting and cut branches are reported as possible pathways.

It is present in Turkey. It was recorded on Citrus spp. Up to date, there is no record on apple in Turkey. It was detected in the Black Sea region (Artvin, Giresun, Ordu, Samsun, Trabzon, Rize provinces) (Kaydan et. al., 2013); however, there is no L. japonica pest‐free area in Turkey.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Roguing and pruning, (iii) Pesticide application, (iv) Natural biological control, (v) Refrigeration and (vi) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Low initial infestations might be overlooked and macroscopic misidentification is possible. Chemical applications can affect biological control agents. Chemicals are applied targeting mainly crawlers, however, no details are given on which pesticides are applied from those listed in Dossier, Section 2.0, on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods. Low storage temperature can prevent or slow down the development of the pest but will not eliminate it.

Main uncertainties

– No records of L. japonica on Malus are available.

– It is unclear whether the pesticides are applied on a calendar basis or following ad hoc application as function of pest presence, or both

– Screening of certified material for this pest could not ensure pest absence because young stages can be difficult to detect.

– The pest was detected in the Black Sea region, however no pest‐free area is determined in Turkey.

M. parallela is extremely polyphagous and causes most damage in its native range to Quercus spp., Prunus spp., and Malus spp. Significant damage also occurs on various other woody species, including many native species of Central Asia. Malacosoma parallela is present in Turkey, with no further details on its distribution.

M. parallela can spread by flights of adult moths. All stages of the life cycle can be transported on host plants moving in trade, particularly plants for planting and cut branches. Eggs, larvae and pupae (cocoons) may be associated with wood carrying bark and may be present as contaminants on other commodities.

Measures taken against the pest and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Roguing and pruning, (iii) Pesticide application, (iv) Natural biological control, (v) Refrigeration and (vi) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions of M. domestica plants for planting from Turkey

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Egg masses might be overlooked by non‐trained personnel.

Some of the pesticides listed in the dossier might be effective against the moth. However, no details are given on which pesticides are applied from those listed in Dossier, Section 2.0, on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods.

Low temperatures can slow down its development but not kill the insect.

Main uncertainties

– The pest is reported in Turkey with no details on its distribution

– Egg masses might be overlooked by non‐trained personnel

– The insecticide applications are not targeted to M. parallela and may not be effective

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest/pathogen could enter exporting nurseries

Pratylenchus loosi is a polyphagous, migratory endoparasite found in both soil and roots. It is considered the most serious pest of tea in Sri Lanka and many other tea‐producing countries including India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Iran and Russia. Yield reduction can range from 4 to 40%. Damage is greater in young infested tea plantations and nurseries where damage of 60 to 100% may occur if adequate control measures are not taken. This nematode has also been found on several important crops such as apples, oranges, pears, potatoes, eggplants, wheat, lentils, pasture grasses, coffee, cabbage and bananas.

In Turkey, P. loosi has been reported from limited areas in very low populations in potato, eggplant, wheat and lentils but has not been found on apples. According to the available information, the nematode has been reported on cultivated plants in Turkey in two regions (Sanliurfa, Ankara). So far, no epidemics or economic losses have been reported in Turkey, but uncertainties exist due to lack of data from official monitoring surveys and reports of problems caused by this nematode in Turkish apple production.

The main pathways of this nematode are infested plants for planting, contaminated water, soil and growing media as such or attached to plants, agricultural machinery, tools and shoes. This nematode may be present in the roots of apple plants or other host plants found in the environment and may infest the commodity mainly through human‐assisted dispersal.

Measures taken against the pest/pathogen and their efficacy

The relevant proposed measures are: (i) Inspection, certification and surveillance, (ii) Sampling and laboratory testing, (iii) Selection of production sites, (iv) Removal of soil from roots (washing), and (v) Pre‐consignment inspection.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions from Turkey.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Root‐lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) are not on the list of harmful organisms systematically monitored or tested for their presence on plants intended for planting in Turkey. Soil and plants are tested in the laboratory only for the presence of root‐knot and virus vector nematodes, but not for the presence of Pratylenchus spp. The undetected presence of this nematode during inspections may contribute to the spread of P. loosi infection. In addition, pre‐export root washing does not reduce the risk of nematode infestation in plants intended for planting that are infested with root lesion nematodes (migratory endoparasites).

Main uncertainties

• Soil is laboratory tested only for the presence of root‐knot and virus vector nematodes, but not for the presence of Pratylenchus spp.

• Symptoms caused by P. loosi may be overlooked.

• Presence of P. loosi is not easy to be detected.

• Root washing does not reduce the risk of nematodes (migratory endoparasites) infestation in plants intended for planting.

Summary of the information used for the evaluation

Possibility that the pest/pathogen could enter exporting nurseries

ToRSV has a wide host range, including herbaceous and woody plant species. Its occurrence in Turkey is restricted to four provinces/regions, where ToRSV has been found in some cultivated plant species. The dispersal range of ToRSV infection by natural processes appear to be constrained, as the nematode‐vector species of the Xiphinema americanum group have not been reported recently in Turkey.

Measures taken against the pest/pathogen and their efficacy

Only certified class plant material is used at the production areas, and quarantine practices are carried out in accordance with the ‘Seedling Certification Regulation’ and ‘Regulation on the Registration of Plant Passports and Operators’.

Interception records

There are no records of interceptions of M. domestica plants for planting from Turkey due to the presence of ToRSV.

Shortcomings of current measures/procedures

Details on the inspections and surveillance to detect ToRSV.

Main uncertainties

5.4. Evaluation of the application of specific measures in the Turkey

Annex X of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 specifies a list of plants, plant products and other objects, originating from third countries and the corresponding special requirements for their introduction into the Union territory or Protected Zones. According to the above‐mentioned annexes special measures are required for the import of the commodity from Turkey related to Erwinia amylovora.

According to Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2012/138, special measures are in place for import of Malus domestica plants with respect to Anoplophora chinensis.

The evaluation of the specific measures is specified in Table .

Table 8

Pest namePointEvaluation of Specific measure to be implemented Erwinia amylovora Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, Annex X, item 9Based on the information provided in the dossier, including the supplementary information, the exporting country does not meet the specific requirements for a certificate regarding Erwinia amylovora. There is no official pest free area nor is there a buffer zone as specified in the legislation. Anoplophora chinensis Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2012/138, Annex IBased on the information provided in the dossier, including the supplementary information, the exporting country does meet the requirement for a certificate regarding Anoplophora chinensis for plant for planting that originates from Turkish provinces other than Istanbul. This insect has a limited distribution, and it is present and under eradication only in Istanbul province.

6. Conclusions

There are 12 pests identified to be present in Turkey and considered to be potentially associated with bare‐rooted rootstocks and grafted plants of Malus domestica imported from Turkey and relevant for the EU.

For Erwinia amylovora, the exporting country does not meet the specific requirements for a certificate regarding this pest.

For Anoplophora chinensis, the exporting country does meet the requirement for a certificate regarding for plant for planting that originates from Turkish provinces other than Istanbul.

For the remaining pests (Calepitrimerus baileyi, Cenopalpus irani, Cicadatra persica, Diplodia bulgarica, Lopholeucaspis japonica, Malacosoma parallela, Pyrolachnus pyri and tomato ringspot virus), the likelihood of pest freedom after the evaluation of the proposed risk mitigation measures for bare‐rooted rootstocks, grafted plants, budwood and scions of Malus domestica designated for export to the EU was estimated. For Hoplomaimus galeatus and Pratylenchus loosi, the likelihood of pest freedom after the evaluation of the proposed risk mitigation measures for bare‐rooted rootstocks of Malus domestica designated for export to the EU was estimated.

For Calepitrimerus baileyi, the likelihood of pest freedom following evaluation of current risk mitigation measures was estimated as ‘Pest free with some exceptional cases’ with the 90% uncertainty range reaching from ‘Pest free with some exceptional cases’ to ‘Almost always pest free’.

Measures

Control (of a pest) is defined in ISPM 5 (FAO, 2017) as “Suppression, containment or eradication of a pest population” (FAO, 1995). Control measures are measures that have a direct effect on pest abundance. Supporting measures are organisational measures or procedures supporting the choice of appropriate risk mitigation measures that do not directly affect pest abundance.

Pathway

Any means that allows the entry or spread of a pest (FAO, 2017)

Phytosanitary measures

Any legislation, regulation or official procedure having the purpose to prevent the introduction or spread of quarantine pests, or to limit the economic impact of regulated non‐quarantine pests (FAO, 2017)

Protected zone

A Protected zone is an area recognised at EU level to be free from a harmful organism, which is established in one or more other parts of the Union.

Quarantine pest

A pest of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled (FAO, 2017)

Regulated non‐quarantine pest

A non‐quarantine pest whose presence in plants for planting affects the intended use of those plants with an economically unacceptable impact and which is therefore regulated within the territory of the importing contracting party (FAO, 2017)

Risk mitigation measure

A measure acting on pest introduction and/or pest spread and/or the magnitude of the biological impact of the pest should the pest be present. A risk mitigation measure may become a phytosanitary measure, action or procedure according to the decision of the risk manager

Group Mites EPPO code CALEBA Regulated status

The pest is not regulated in the EU, neither is on any EPPO list, but it is present in EPPO database.

Pest status in Turkey The pest is reported in Turkey in Erzurum (Alaoglu, 1984), Tokat (Yanar and Ecevit, 2005), Van Lake Basin: Iskele, Gürpinar, Edremit on Malus pumila Mill., M. sylvestris Mill., M. communis L. (Rosaceae). New records: Ankara, Van‐Ahlat, Iskele on Malus pumila Mill., M. sylvestris Mill., M. communis L. (Denizhan and Çobanoǧlu, 2010), Yalova, Armutlu (Denizhan, 2018). Pest status in the EU Present in Poland and Greece (Fauna Europaea; GBIF; De Lillo, Amrine. 1998). Host status on Malus domestica Malus domestica is a host of the pest and the species can complete its life cycle on this host (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011); however, another author wrote that this species is vagrant and that the mites survive on the leaves (Denizhan, 2018). The pest status is confirmed also by others authors (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011; Jeppson et al., 1975; Momen & Lamlom, 2021). PRA information No PRA is available for C. baileyi. Other relevant information for the assessment Biology C. baileyi is able to develop successfully from egg to adult at temperatures between 23°C and 35°C, and 65% RH. It has two nymphal stages, each followed by a resting stage, before reaching adulthood. The duration of egg (incubation period), first instar nymph, nymphochrysalis, second instar nymph, imagochrysalis, pre‐oviposition and post‐oviposition decreases as temperature increases. The oviposition duration decreases with increasing temperature, specifically it goes from an average of 24–22 days with temperatures ranging from 23°C to 35°C. Most of the eggs are laid alongside the midrib or veins of the leaf. Females deposit between 12 and 23 eggs with temperatures ranging from 23°C to 35°C. The total life cycle is completed after 9.7 to 5.3 days depending on sex (i.e. males develop faster) and temperature (23–35°C) (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011). In Egypt, population dynamics of C. baileyi was affected by climatic conditions and about 11 generations were recorded per year (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011). Symptoms Main type of symptoms Mite feeding causes browning on the underside of apple leaves, partial defoliation, rolled and distorted leaves russet on fruit and delays or inhibits plant apical growth (Creelman, 1971; Abou‐Awad et al., 2011). Presence of asymptomatic plants

In early September, C. baileyi deutogynes hibernate mainly in small, permanently dormant buds and under the loose bark of spurs and around buds on 1‐year‐old shoots, and move into fruiting buds between the shoot and the pink bud stages and in vegetative buds when the buds have started to swell (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011).

The deutogyne will seek refuge for aestivating and/or overwintering (e.g. under tree bark scales) until early spring when it begins laying eggs that develop into protogynes (Beaulieu and Knee, 2014).

Confusion with other pests

The two conspecific morphs (deutogyne and protogynes) may be wrongly assigned to different species or even genera (Jeppson et al., 1975), although the forms can generally be correctly associated with each other with experience and good sample sizes (Beaulieu and Knee, 2014).

There is a single sequence in GenBank of a specimen collected on Malus domestica (Calepitrimerus baileyi voucher MAL91.3 large subunit ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence, ACCESSION {"type":"entrez-nucleotide","attrs":{"text":"MW633874","term_id":"1990480402","term_text":"MW633874"}}MW633874) (visited on 10.29.21, can help with diagnosis.

Calepitrimerus mathiasrexi is similar in morphology to Calepitrimerus baileyi and Calepitrimerus cariniferus Keifer (Keifer, 1938; Baker et al., 1996; Amrine et al., 2003), with microscopic differences (Ripka, 2010).

Host plant range Malus pumila Mill., M. sylvestris Mill., M. communis L. (Rosaceae) (Denizhan & Çobanoǧlu, 2010; Creelman, 1971). Reported evidence of impact Partial defoliation can reduce the productivity of the plants (Abou‐Awad et al., 2011; Creelman, 1971). Pathways and evidence that the commodity is a pathway The most possible way to spread is through the introduction of plant materials, as the mite can be found in buds, even in resting ones. There is no reference in the literature regarding the possibility fruit being a pathway. There are no data on the active dispersal capacity of the pest. Surveillance information No surveillance information is currently available from the Turkey NPPO for Calepitrimerus baileyi

A.1.2. Possibility of pest presence in the nursery

A.1.2.1. Possibility of entry from the surrounding environment

If present in the surroundings, the pest can enter the nursery (as Turkey is producing these plants for planting outdoors). The most likely pathway to enter the nursery is by infested plant material or by nursery workers and machinery, though the mite can also be transported by wind.

Uncertainties

–

No data are available on the population densities of the pest in the areas of production.

–

The main uncertainty is whether the pest is present in the production areas in Turkey.

Taking into consideration the above evidence and uncertainties, the Panel considers that it is possible for the pest to enter the nursery

A.1.2.2. Possibility of entry with new plants/seeds

The pest can be found on the trunk, stem, branches, leaves of plants for planting and it is difficult to be spotted during visual inspections. The pest can be hidden inside buds.

Uncertainties

–

Uncertain if certified material is screened for this pest

–

Pest present in Turkey and part of the certified mother material comes from same country, it is unclear if material is inspected for presence of this pest

Taking into consideration the above evidence and uncertainties, the Panel considers it possible that the pest could enter the nursery.

A.1.2.3. Possibility of spread within the nursery

If the pest enters the nursery from the surroundings, it could spread within the nursery either by passive dispersal (e.g. wind), infested plant material, or by nursery workers and machinery. Active dispersal is possible although very short range or transferred from plant to plant if plants are touching with each other.

Taking into consideration the above evidence, the Panel considers that the transfer of the pest within the nursery is possible.

A.1.3. Information from interceptions

There are no records of interceptions of M. domestica plants for planting from Turkey due to the presence of C. baileyi between 1994 and March 2022 (EUROPHYT and TRACES‐NT, online).

A.1.4. Evaluation of the risk mitigation options

In the table below, all risk mitigation measures currently applied in Turkey are listed and an indication of their effectiveness on C. baileyi is provided. The description of the risk mitigation measures currently applied in Turkey is provided in the Table .

No. Risk mitigation measure (name)DescriptionEffectiveEvaluation/Uncertainties1Certified material

The Ministerial experts and inspectors carry out the phytosanitary control on mother plants in spring, summer and autumn for harmful organisms, and the amount of propagation materials (grafted plants, budwoods, rootstocks, scions) that can be obtained from mother plants is determined. For the saplings, the phytosanitary control is also carried out at the same time, regarding harmful organisms specified in quarantine and plant passports, and certification regulations. If free from the harmful organisms, the Ministry issues certificates and labels for the propagation material to be taken from plants in the mother blocks.

Certified seed or certified seedling is grafted with certified budwood in a certified nursery.

Certificate and combined certification‐passport labels are issued by the Ministerial Organization and sent to the producer for the saplings that meet the requirements in the Regulations.

Yes

Potential C. baileyi infestations might be overlooked by visual inspection especially in the case of low infestations without using an adequate magnification considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles.

Uncertainties:

The details of the certification process are not given (e.g. number of plants, intensity of surveys and inspections, etc.).

Specific figures on the intensity of survey (sampling effort) are not provided.

2Phytosanitary certificates

Export nurseries must obtain special certification from Turkish Authorities before they begin producing plants for planting. Nurseries must notify technical staff members responsible for production to obtain this certificate, which is then used for registration in the plant passport system. The phytosanitary inspections are done macroscopically. However, if there are signs of disease in the plants or in the immediate vicinity, the inspections are carried out by laboratory analysis.

During the production period, official inspection is carried out. After the official approval that the sapling is free from the quarantine factor and true to type, its certificate‐passport label is issued by the Ministry.

The Phytosanitary Certificates/Re‐Export Phytosanitary Certificates are issued in exportation of plants and plant products with respect to plant health. In issuing such certificates, the phytosanitary requirements of the importer country are taken into account, in compliance with the ISPM No: 7 and ISPM No: 12 rules.

Yes

The procedures applied could be effective in detecting C. baileyi infestations though low densities might be overlooked by visual inspection without using an adequate magnification considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles.

Uncertainties:

Specific figures on the intensity of survey (sampling effort) are not provided.

3Cleaning and disinfection of facilities, tools and machineryTools are disinfected with chemical compounds containing 10% chlorine prior to using in sapling and mother plantsYes

Cleaning of tools and machineries can lower the possibility of entry and spread.

Uncertainties:

No details are provided.

4Roguing and pruningRemoval of infested branchesYes

Pruning can reduce infestation.

5Biological and mechanical control

Biological control with different natural enemies (predators and parasitoids) can reduce the pest populations.

Nogall (biological control agent) is applied to protect against crown gall.

Yes

Phytoseiid species are reported preying on this species. They can be present in the environment though no details are provided in the dossier.

Uncertainties:

No details are provided on abundance and efficacy of the natural enemies.

6Pesticide application

The saplings are sprayed against aphids, thrips, whiteflies, red spider pests, black spot, powdery mildew, root rot diseases and, depending on the situation, to fight or protect against weeds.

Before loading the plants on the trucks for transport, the roots of seedlings are sprayed with fungicide (Thiram).

Yes

Some of the pesticides listed in the dossier might be effective against the mite, specifically acrinathrin and abamectin.

Uncertainties:

No details are given on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods.

7Surveillance and monitoringNecessary precautions are taken to ensure that there are no plants other than certified saplings in the production plot and application areas. Plants closer than 15 m from the plot are not usually available. Plants around the production areas are also annually inspected by the Ministry expert in terms of quarantine organisms. In the event that these plants are contaminated with harmful organisms subject to quarantine, these plants and saplings in this area are destroyed.Yes

It can be effective.

Uncertainties:

Specific figures on the intensity of survey (sampling effort) are not provided and considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles.

8Sampling and laboratory testing

For the identification of viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes in the seedlings to be exported, min. 5 to max. 25 seedlings are randomly taken from the plantation in the nursery garden and sealed by the inspector and sent to the laboratory for analysis.

Soil samples are taken for laboratory analysis in terms of quarantine organisms, particularly to check if it is free from nematodes. If it is found that the growing medium is free from nematodes, the production of saplings is started.

Yes

It can be effective

Uncertainties:

The modalities and intensity of survey is not known.

9Root WashingRoots are washed in the washing areas, near the warehouses.No10RefrigerationThe temperature of the storage tanks is between 2°C and 4°C and the humidity is 85‐95%. Transportation is made with refrigerated trucks with the same conditions.YesLow temperatures can slow down its development but not kill the mite.11Pre‐consignment inspectionPrior to export, planting material for which a Phytosanitary Certificate is to be issued shall be subjected to phytosanitary inspection. Only certified plants for planting may be exported. Phytosanitary inspectors are responsible for export controls, sampling and issuing certificates.Yes

The procedures applied could be effective in detecting C. baileyi though the mite presence could be overlooked by visual inspection especially in the case of low infestations without using an adequate magnification considering the tiny size of the individuals both adults and juveniles.

Uncertainties:

Specific figures on the intensity of survey (sampling effort) are not provided.

A.1.5. Overall likelihood of pest freedom

A.1.5.1. Reasoning for a scenario which would lead to a reasonably low number of infested consignments

Limited distribution of the pest.

All propagation material is produced within the nurseries.

The natural spread is limited.

Pesticides are effective against eggs, larvae and adults.

Pruning reduces infestation levels, increase sunlight exposure.

Biological enemies are present.

Presence of clear symptoms during the vegetative season.

Careful inspections by trained personnel using proper tools identify infestations.

Control of mother plants by educated experts.

Bundles are composed by 10 plants.

Mainly young plants, e.g. rootstocks, are exported.

A.1.5.2. Reasoning for a scenario which would lead to a reasonably high number of infested consignments

Malus domestica is a preferred host.

Spread to more area in Turkey/no climatic restrictions.

Most of the propagation material is produced in other nurseries.

Wind and human assisted dispersal play a role in spreading the pest.

Pesticides are not effective against eggs, larvae and adults.

Biological enemies are not present or affected by pesticide treatments.

Inspections are not effective in identifying pest presence.

Control of mother plants is not effective.

Bundles are composed by 25 plants.

Mainly older plants, e.g. grafted trees, are exported.

Low density infestation can be overlooked due to the absence of symptoms.

A.1.5.3. Reasoning for a central scenario equally likely to over‐ or underestimate the number of infested consignments (Median)

The median is slightly closer to the lower values in relation to the uncertainties on pest pressure in the production areas of Malus domestica plants for planting.

A.1.5.4. Reasoning for the precision of the judgement describing the remaining uncertainties (1st and 3rd quartile/interquartile range)

The values reflect a high uncertainty due to the lack of information on pest pressure, effectiveness of sampling and laboratory testing and the difficulty to detect the pest by visual inspection. Moreover, no details are given on the pesticide application schedule and on the application methods.

A.1.5.5. Elicitation outcomes of the assessment of the pest freedom for Calepitrimerus baileyi

The following Tables show the elicited and fitted values for pest infestation (Table ) and pest freedom (Table ).

Other relevant information for the assessment Biology

Females and males of C. irani are about 0.3 mm long, red, oval shaped and dorsoventrally flattened. These mites hibernate in branches, between October and March. C. irani is one of the most important tenuipalpid pests on apple and it completes three generations per year in Iran (Rashki et al., 2002). Fertilised females appear in April, at an average daily air temperature of +15°C. The first generation occurs at the end of April and May, the second at the end of June and the third near the end of August. Larvae and nymphal stages are about 0.2 mm long and red. The population of this mite rapidly increases to a high density during the summer with increasing temperature and dryness. Female populations peak in September and October and by the mid of this month they start to hibernate (Darbemamieh et al., 2009; Khanjani et al., 2012, 2013; Rashki et al., 2004).

Both reproductive parameters such as fecundity and fertility, and survival parameters of C. irani are influenced by temperature. An increase in temperature, from 15 to 30°C, leads to increases in fecundity and fertility rates and to a decrease in mortality percentage (Bazgir et al., 2015).

C. irani is phytophagous, and has been reported on apple, pear, olive, walnut, quince, grapevine, sour cherry, plum, peach, fig and pistachio (Mehrnejad and Ueckermann, 2001; Gholamzera et al., 2013). C. irani is widely distributed in apple orchards and is one of the most important tenuipalpid pests on apple in Iran (Darbemamieh et al., 2009; Rashki et al., 2002). It is reported as present in Turkey and widespread in Iran (Khanjani et al., 2012, 2013; Sultan et al., 2019).

Symptoms Main type of symptoms

C. irani feeds on stems, fruits, flowers and leaves, often on the lower surface, sometimes causing serious damage to various crops.

It is difficult to detect spider mites at low densities, since these are invisible to the naked eye. To confirm their presence an examination with a stereomicroscope of the undersides of leaves is necessary. The presence of spider mites is usually associated with the presence of white exuviae and webbing; however, C . irani and other Tenuipalpidae are considered false spider mites as they do not produce silk webbings on plants (Fathipour et al., 2016).

Presence of asymptomatic plants

The absence of leaves does not allow to detect symptoms. Resting stages of mites on the bark are not associated with symptoms.
