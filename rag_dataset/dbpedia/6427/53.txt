Moodysson's adaptation of his wife Coco's graphic novel is the story of three outsiders living in 1980s Stockholm.

We Are the Best!, the new film from acclaimed Swedish director Lukas Moodysson (Lilya 4-Ever), is gathering steam in Cannes with Metrodome snatching up U.K. rights to the 1980s period piece after seeing a three-minute promo screened by sales agent TrustNordisk.

Metrodome, which released Moodysson's Lilya 4-Ever and Together in Britain, was the first to board the in-production feature, which is based on the graphic novel of the same name by Moodysson's wife Coco, a well-known comics artist in Sweden.

The film follows three young misfits growing up in 1980s Stockholm.

Lars Jonsson is producing We Are the Best! for Memfis Film with Film i Vast, SVT and Zentropa as co-producers. The Swedish release is set for October.

We Are the Best! is billed as a return to Moodysson's funnier, lighter films, such as F-ing Amal (1998) and Together, compared with the darker fare of his more recent work, such as Mammoth (2009) and A Hole in My Heart (2004).

In addition to the U.K., Trust has also closed pre-sales in Cannes for the title with Wild Bunch Benelux for the Netherlands, Frenetic Films for Switzerland and Continental Film for the former Yugoslavia. Trust CEO Rikke Ennis said several other territories were under negotiation for the film, which she expected “will hit theaters worldwide.”
