What is the Hungarian Wax Pepper?

The Hungarian Wax Pepper, as its name suggests, originated in Hungary. Also known as the Hungarian Hot Wax Pepper, it is easily confused with the similar-looking banana pepper, but it is much hotter.

The Hungarian Wax is harvested before complete maturity, while it is still yellow, and about 8 inches long and 2 inches thick. If left to mature fully, these peppers could grow larger and would turn red, and their heat level would increase considerably.

What are Hungarian Wax Peppers Like?

The skin of these peppers is waxy and even crunchy, but completely edible. They have a thick flesh.

The sweet, hot flavor of these peppers is very popular in mole sauces, and other traditional Latin dishes, soups and salads. They may be found pickled or sold fresh at stores or markets, and are a favorite of home gardeners everywhere.

I personally enjoy pickling Hungarian Wax Peppers and using them for a bit of a crunchy addition to salads or other meals. Toss some directly on the grill and roast them up.

I also like to leave them on the plants to ripen to red and then pick them. Here's a photo of some ripe Hungarian Wax Peppers picked from my garden recently.
