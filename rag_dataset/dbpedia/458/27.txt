Carlota is the Sales Director at Travesía Cuatro CDMX, a space devoted to reflect on the composition and the diversity of discourses that coexist within the artistic scenes in Europe and Latin América. Founded in 2003 in Madrid, the gallery opened a second space in the city of Guadalajara, México, in the Casa Franco, a 1929 home designed by Guadalajara-born architect Luis Barragán, and most recently opened Travesía Cuatro CDMX.

Pérez-Jofre was born and raised in Madrid, Spain to a family immerse in the arts, culture and design worlds.

Her grandparents have long fostered and collected Spanish art, having assembled a collection that highlights 20th century artist such as Guillermo Pérez Villalta. Her mother has been devoted to the institutional sector, promoting the development of artistic and cultural projects while working with museums such as The Guggenheim Bilbao. Her father is an architect and developer based Madrid.

Carlota studied Art History between the Autonomous University of Madrid and La Sorbonne in Paris. After gathering firsthand art and curatorial experience through an apprenticeship at Travesía Cuatro in Madrid, she moved to Paris to launch the innovative editorial project Sans Soucy, and worked as a curator under artist and photographer Renate Graf.

After arriving in México in 2015 to work with Mexican conceptual artist Mario García Torres, she settled and never looked back. The ever resurgent and complex sociocultural landscape of the metropolis allows for a uniquely diverse canvas from which she draws the rhythm and sets the tone for Travesía Cuatro’s market sphere, exhibitions and programs in México and the Americas.

We visited Carlota at Travesía Cuatro CDMX, located at the epicenter of the city’s culinary and artistic zeitgeist in Roma Norte.
