Reinier Jesus was a happy young man a couple of years ago. Having scored one of Brazil's five goals against Bolivia in a pre-Olympic Games match, he had his bags packed and was ready to set off to Madrid to work under Raul Gonzalez at Real Madrid Castilla.

Reinier was the latest young Brazilian Real Madrid had signed, following Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo Goes.

He made his debut on February 23, 2020, and after just three games the COVID-19 pandemic brought football to a standstill. But in those games he showed enough for Real Madrid to understand that the Segunda B was not a high enough level for his talent.

In August 2020 Reinier left on loan to Borussia Dortmund, but 17 months later he's run out of happiness. The move should have been perfect, and Dortmund's style should have suited him perfectly, but things haven't gone to plan there.

In those 17 months Reinier has played just 614 minutes across 30 appearances, averaging 20 minutes per game. He has started just three games and scored just once.

Since he moved to Dortmund, 30 players have played more minutes than him.

Reinier is still just 20 years old

Nothing has gone to plan over the last year and a half, and Real Madrid know that it has been a failed move. Reinier hasn't grown at all, and he hasn't had an easy time in Germany during the pandemic.

Los Blancos know that Reinier has to return to Spain to find a new solution, as he needs to play regularly. Dortmund, though, don't intend to let him leave.

The Bundesliga side are counting on having him until the end of the season, even though they aren't using him. He's having to suffer like Andriy Lunin had to in previous loan spells away from Real Madrid, only for Los Blancos to cut those short in order to find him playing time elsewhere.
