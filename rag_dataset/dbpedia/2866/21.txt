Message sent on behalf of Carol Ann Davis, Associate Dean, to USF Libraries staff.

I am writing with happy news! USF is a member of the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL), and the ASERL group acquired the attached list of Adam Matthew Digital collections. As an ASERL member, USF now has perpetual access to all Adam Matthew Digital titles published through 2016, a total of 77 resources. There are no fees or ongoing costs for this set of resources.

Each of these collections would have been a substantial investment for the USF Libraries to acquire, so this is a significant addition to our collections. Adam Matthew will be offering training through ASERL towards the end of the month and has offered to provide a training session to interested USF Libraries staff. In the meantime, the USF Libraries Collections & Discovery group has added these materials to the Databases A-Z list.

Stay tuned for more information, but in the meantime, please share this information with your faculty.

Best wishes,

Carol Ann
