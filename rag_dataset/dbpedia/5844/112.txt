Musical Arranger to the Stars remembered in weekend of celebrations and publication of book.

A weekend packed with music and film will mark the publication of a biography of one of Yorkshire's most famous musical sons on the centenary of his birth.

Musician, musical director, arranger and composer Geoff Love, who died aged 73 in 1991, was born in Todmorden on September 4, 1917. Geoff grew up in Tod and took his first musical steps there on the way to a career which saw him work with some of the world's top music stars and â selling millions of records - become a recording star and showbusiness personality in his own right.

Smash hits

These included landmark hit recordings by artists such as Laurie London and Danny Williams, whose "He's Got The Whole World In His Hands" and "Moon River" respectively were UK hit parade smashes with the former a huge hit in America.

Manuel and The Music of the Mountains

From the 1950s through to the 1980s, Love was everywhere, producing hundreds of top quality musical arrangements for a host of major artists and, under his own name or that of Manuel and The Music of the Mountains, selling millions of records across the world.

Showbiz friends

He appeared regularly on British television, especially alongside his close friend Max Bygraves, and backed EMI artist Frank Ifield on stage in Las Vegas. While in New York, he and his wife Joy were given a personal guided tour of the city's musical landmarks by big band jazz legend and soon to be the world's most famous record producer, Quincy Jones.

Geoff Love's story is a who's who of music at a worldwide boom time for the record industry â he was a key part of a truly golden era.

Love's legacy

Love never forgot his roots, regularly returning to Todmorden to play concerts with the town's brass band and left an ongoing legacy after establishing the Young Persons Concert Foundation, a showcase for the best young musical talent giving concerts and workshops free of charge with a driving principle that no child should be deprived of live music merely because they did not have access to it.
