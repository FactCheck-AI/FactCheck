One of young auteurs of Turkish film, Alper Caglar directed his first feature when he was 28 years old. Caglar is a director known nationally for tackling polarizing topics and maverick genres. He writes and edits all of his films, as well as being the executive producer of his most recent ones.

Films often involve anachronistic editing in order to provide a twist or a revelation in the third act.
