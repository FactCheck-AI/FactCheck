Born Under a Bad Sign is the second compilation album by American blues musician Albert King, released in August 1967 by Stax Records. The album features eleven electric blues tracks recorded between March 1966 and June 1967 across five different sessions, with King accompanied by two bands: Booker T. & the M.G.'s and the Memphis Horns. While the album did not chart, it garnered critical acclaim and is often regarded as one of the greatest blues albums ever.
