The 1996-99 Porsche 911 GT1 was produced for the GT1 class of sportscar racing, a street legal version was required for homologation purposes.

Itâ€™s frontal chassis was shared with the then (993) 911, while the rear of the car was derived from the Porsche 962. The engine was mounted further forward than a 911.

The GT1 won its class at LeMans in 1996.

In 1997, now the GT1 Evo, the front end was revised featuring headlamps similar to the new 911 of that year. Reliability problems failed to give the GT1 success this year.

A new body in 1998, the 911 GT1-98, despite being slower than some of the other cars, it got first and second place overall at LeMans.

The GT1 class was cancelled in 1999
