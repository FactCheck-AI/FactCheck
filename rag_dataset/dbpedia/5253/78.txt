History

The Porsche 911 GT1 is a sports racing that was built and developed by Porsche. At the time, cars competing in the GT1 Category were heavily modified versions of the road cars, such as the McLaren F1 and Ferrari F40. When Porsche built their GT1 race car, it was not a development of one of their road cars, but a purpose built, Race Car. And to comply with regulations a Street Legal version was developed.

The Porsche 911 GT1 had little in common with the 911 of the time. Only the Front end, Headlights, and Rear Lights was shared with the 911 of the time. The rear of the chassis was derived from the 962, with a twin turbo charged, 3.2L Flat Six Engine, mounted longitudinally in a rear Mid-Engine, Rear wheel drive layout.

The 1996 Porsche 911 GT1 was clocked at 330 Km/hr on the Mulsanne Straight in the practice sessions of the 1996 Le Mans 24 hr race.
