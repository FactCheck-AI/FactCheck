American actress, playwright and humorist with a penchant for acerbic wit. The daughter of matin√©e idol Otis Skinner, she made her stage debut in 1921, after completing studies in Paris. During the 1920's and 30's, she became famous for her monodramas and for her humorous writings, published in various magazines, including The New Yorker. She also penned essays and self-deprecating anecdotes later collated in book form as "Nuts in May". Among her many laudable successes as an actress were her performances in "Lady Windermere's Fan" in 1946, and in "The Pleasure of His Company" on Broadway, in 1958. After the latter, she essentially retired from the stage.
