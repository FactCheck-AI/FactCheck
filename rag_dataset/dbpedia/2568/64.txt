This is (the third of three) a private sensory-friendly DCPS show for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder in grades 5-8. This is the only show at 11:00.

“Super Me” is a fast-paced theatrical adventure that combines high-energy hip-hop dance, intense video gaming, astounding magic, interactive animation, and a live actor. Audience members are taken on a virtual journey into a comic book world to help a young boy escape from bullies. The audience must help the animated boy overcome obstacles and solve puzzles using superpowers onstage. Kids not only see real-life examples of bullying but are given clear, step-by-step actions to help stop bullying.
