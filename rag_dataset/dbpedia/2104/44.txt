E16, Helgoland & Düne

Helgoland (Heligoland) is a piece of red rock in the North Sea, about 63 km (40 mi) to the northwest of Cuxhaven. The island is only 1.7 square-km (0.7 sq mi) in area with a population of about 1500. The neighbouring islet of Düne was created when surge from the 1721 New Year’s Day storm submerged the land connection with Helgoland. Helgoland has the towering red cliffs; Düne has lots of fine white sand.
