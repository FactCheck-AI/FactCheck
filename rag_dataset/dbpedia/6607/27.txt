Stokerverse, the first RolePlaying Game based on a franchise award-winning writer Dr. Chris McAuley created with Dacre Stoker, is coming soon from Nightfall Games.

“This is a visceral Victorian environment with twists on classic characters and an authentic continuation of the original Dracula narrative,” says Chris.

The StokerVerse is the brainchild of international bestselling author Dacre Stoker, the great grand-nephew of Bram Stoker and Chris McAuley, the award-winning artist, writer and gaming expert. Stoker & McAuley LLC set out to re-energise the Stoker Dracula IP last year, and show the world the true, authentic depiction of what Bram, the creator of Dracula, had intended for his universe of horror through various modern interactive media.

Nightfall Games is the home of SLA Industries, the ENnie award-winning cult role-playing game which was created in Scotland in 1993. In 2020, SLA Industries 2nd Edition was launched after a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019. Nightfall Games is bringing The Terminator to life as an RPG, with a Kickstarter campaign that ran in 2021.

The company already launched the StokerVerse Roleplaying Game Quick Start, back in March, a 70-page introduction to the StokerVerse.

It follows the ethos of other Nightfall Games Quickstarts, such as those for The Terminator RPG and SLA Industries, in introducing the players to the rules that have been designed specifically for the StokerVerse RPG, based on Nightfall Games’ very own S5S system.
