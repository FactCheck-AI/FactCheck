Smith College student dining workers became one of the first such employee groups in the country to unionize on Feb. 1 after 99% of student workers voted in favor, according to union organizer Sam Heyne.

Heyne is an union organizer with Local 153 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union, with which the Smith students affiliated. Smith student workers are calling their labor unit the United Smith Student Workers union.
