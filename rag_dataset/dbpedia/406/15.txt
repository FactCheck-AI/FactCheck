Smith College Ringing

The Western Massachusetts Guild of Change Ringers rings on the Smith College campus, and the student ringers are affiliated with Smith College as a student organization. Change ringing is open to all faculty, staff and students as well as extended community members who wish to ring the bells on campus and share their wonderful sounds on important Smith occasions. There are social opportunities just for students as well as for the whole band.

PRACTICE TIMES

Mondays and Thursdays, Mendenhall Bell Tower, 17:30-19:30. Additionally, there is handbell practice most Saturdays, 13:00-15:00, and QP attempts at 15:00 on the second Saturday of each month. Practices generally continue to be held outside the academic term. These times are current as of Spring 2024.

Smith College Ringers

The current band of ringers at Smith College includes Smith students, staff and alumnae. There are also members from the wider community, including occasional visitors from Boston and Connecticut.

We owe our gratitude to Alice Dickinson, Mathematics Professor Emerita for her efforts in bringing the bells to Smith and her work in building the changeringing exercise in North America.
