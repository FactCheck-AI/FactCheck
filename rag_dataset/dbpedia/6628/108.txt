The Exit 8 is an interesting Japanese indie horror game that draws inspiration from the aesthetics of liminal spaces. Liminal spaces often evoke a sense of unease and mystery, making them a popular choice for horror game settings. The game’s premise, set in a Japanese subway with a main character trapped in an endless underground passage, certainly sets the stage for a suspenseful and eerie experience.

The description of elements repeating themselves as the player progresses, similar to the corridor in PT, suggests a psychological horror aspect where the player may experience a sense of dread and confusion. PT, which was meant to be a Silent Hills teaser, gained notoriety for its immersive and unsettling gameplay. If The Exit 8 manages to capture some of that atmosphere, it could be a promising addition to the horror game genre.

It’s always exciting to see indie developers exploring unique and immersive horror experiences, and it’ll be interesting to see how The Exit 8 is received by players when it’s released on Steam. The combination of a Japanese subway setting, and the themes of repetition and tension could create a compelling horror game.
