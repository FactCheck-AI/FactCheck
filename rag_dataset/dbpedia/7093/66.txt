The Clock (1945)

Academy Award winner Judy Garland stars with Robert Walker as a New Yorker and a GI on a 48-hour leave who meet in New York's Pennsylvania train station--under The Clock. New York, World War II. Over two whirlwind days, the impossible happens: Two strangers meet and fall in love with each other, with the City--and with its iconoclastic, eccentric inhabitants in this delightful romance.
