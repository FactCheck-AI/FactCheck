Exhausted from the thrill of his individual gold medal the day before, Justin Huish still came through to help win a U.S. team archery title.

On his last three arrows, the Simi Valley star erased a three-point deficit for the U.S. squad, which went on to beat South Korea, 251-249, and win its first gold medal in the team event.

The Americans fell behind when Huish followed an opening 10 with two 8s that he said were “a mixture of nerves and exhaustion.”

The U.S. team didn’t get even again until Huish hit two 10s and a 9 on his last round. That tied the match at 196 with six arrows remaining, and teammates Butch Johnson and Rod White took over.

“I’m pooped from yesterday, they carried me through,” Huish said.

Italy won the bronze with a 247-244 victory over Australia.

In the women’s gold-medal match, Germany’s Cornelia Pfohl almost missed the entire target on the 19th arrow, opening the door for South Korea women to stretch their Olympic championship streak to three straight.

The U.S. women were ousted, 235-226, by Kazakhstan in their opener. Poland won the women’s bronze with a 244-239 victory over Turkey.
