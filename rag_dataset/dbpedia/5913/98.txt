Omnisphere 2.6.4c | Keyscape 1.2.0c | Trilian 1.5.0d | November 25th 2020

Info:

These are the most recent updates for Spectrasonics Omnisphere 2.6.4c,

Keyscape 1.2.0c & Trilian 1.5.0d including Patched files for Mac & Windows

Notes:

Since Spectrasonics changed their Authorization method a bit,

it's not possible anymore to patch the plugins using R2R's keygen.

Therefore I applied the patches manually (also to the new Trilian Update,

where no previous RSA2048 patch was available). That took a bit of research

but wasn't very complicated in the end.

Spectrasonics now wants you to request a challenge code online

but an offline activation is still possible, just a bit hidden at the bottom of

the authorization page by clicking the small blue "click here".

This copies an encoded offline activation url to your clipboard,

which you just have to decode to get the missing Challenge Code.

For Windows users I wrote a little tool in AutoIT that reads the url from the

clipboard, decodes it and adds the working Challenge Code back to it.

Also wrote a quick workaround for Mac users using an online decoder.

Instructions are included.

Credits:

Go to Team R2R for their Work on recent updates, to nu disco for supplying

the updates and to a very friendly user who helped me on some mac related

issues and with testing.

Have Fun and Enjoy!
