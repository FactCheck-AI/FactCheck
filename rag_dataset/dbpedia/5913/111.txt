Omnisphere 2.7.0f | Keyscape 1.3.0f | Trilian 1.6.0f | Stylus RMX 1.10.1e | July 31st 2021

Info:

These are the most recent updates for Spectrasonics Omnisphere 2.7.0f,

Keyscape 1.3.0f, Trilian 1.6.0f & Stylus RMX 1.10.1e incl. Patches for Mac & Win

The MacOS patches are codesigned so you just have to copy them over.

Patch Notes:

- Challenge Code url encoding got disabled

- The url in front of the Challenge Code got removed

- R2R's RSA Key got applied

For Win users this means:

By clicking on the blue 'click here' at the bottom of the Authorization screen,

it now copies the real challenge code to the clipboard.

Mac users:

On MacOS I wasn't able to apply my "no encoding" patch because

of the lack of knowledge in Mac debugging so Mac users still have

to use the url decoder (link is in the info file). Other than that,

there are no differences. Result is: You'll get an encoded

challenge code (no url), which you can decode online with ease.

Extra:

As an Extra I created some RSA Patchers (for Win) that allow you to patch

further updates on your own. That way you can use them without

authorizing again.

and to the user who sent me the updates.

Have Fun and Enjoy!
