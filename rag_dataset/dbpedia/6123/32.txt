Fans of Blackadder, Baldrick et al should get in line for tickets to the Millennium Dome which will be premiering a feature-length film of the comedy show in January. Blackadder Back and Forth, which will be shown in the Dome from New Year’s Day 2000, sees the comic duo become time travellers. Baldrick manages to construct a time machine through following Leonardo da Vinci’s plans, which leads to chaos as the pair lurch through time in a manner guaranteed to upset the space/time continuum. Talking to the BBC about the movie, Atkinson says, ‘Bringing Blackadder to the big screen has always been an ambition…I’m delighted to be realising it to celebrate the arrival of the 21st century, but extremely worried at the prospect of travelling through time with Baldrick. Written by Ben Elton and Richard Curtis, the movie has a stellar cast including model Kate Moss, Colin Firth, Miranda Richardson and Atkinson’s fellow comics Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie.
