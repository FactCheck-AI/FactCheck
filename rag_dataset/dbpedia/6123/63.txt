Synopsis: The action starts on New Years Eve 1999 at a dinner party given by Edmund Blackadder to some familiar old friends. Blackadder and Baldrick accidentally set off on a chaotic journey through time in Baldrick's home-made copy of a Leonardo Da Vinci time machine - built as a ruse and never expected to actually work! And with Baldrick's controls, typyically unworkable, the duo find themselves lost in time- visiting random moments through British history, and creating chaos everywhere - as they try to get home for the millennium.
