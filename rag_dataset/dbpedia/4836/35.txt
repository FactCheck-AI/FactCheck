A must have tribute to Swaps: one of thoroughbred racing's greatest stars!

Swaps (Khaled x Iron Reward) is ranked as one of the greatest racehorses in American thoroughbred racing history! His powerful stride, blistering speed and regal looks endeared him to horse lovers everywhere. Swaps descended from the immortal Man o' War through his Triple Crown winning son War Admiral. Among Swaps' impressive wins were the 1955 Kentucky Derby and Santa Anita Derby as well as the 1956 Hollywood Gold Cup. Swaps' only loss as a three year old was a celebrated match race with the great Nashua. As a four year old, Swaps was Horse of the Year. Swaps went on to become an excellent sire, producing 35 stakes winners including the great filly Affectionately and the champion colt Chateaugay (winner of the 1963 Kentucky Derby and Belmont).
