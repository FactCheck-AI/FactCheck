Together with Arlon and Tongeren, Tournai is one of the oldest cities of Belgium. It was the first capital of France and has a tumultuous history, reflected in many of its civil, military and religious buildings. Over the past 2000 years the city has received quite a few famous figures, including Clovis, Charles the Fifth and Louis XIV. Not only the belfry and the cathedral (restoration in progress), both listed as UNESCO world heritage sites, but also the cloth hall (Halle-aux-Draps) and the medieval bridge "Pont des Trous" are prime examples of the cityâ€™s rich heritage.
