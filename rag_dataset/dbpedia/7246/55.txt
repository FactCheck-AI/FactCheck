Laurel and Hardy's famous piano moving scene from 1932's The Music Box was filmed in the Silverlake district of Los Angeles. The scene shows Laurel & Hardy struggling futilely to haul a heavy piano up a long flight of steps. The 131 steps are still in existence today, and are a public staircase (they do not lead to a single residence as in the film). They connect Vendome Street (at the base of the hill) with Descanso Drive (at the top of the hill). They are located near the neighborhood where Sunset Boulevard and Silver Lake Boulevard intersect. The address is 923-935 Vendome Street near the intersection of Del Monte Street. A commemorative plaque was set into one of the lower steps between 1993 and 1995. The "Music Box" steps can be seen in the background of an earlier Charley Chase silent comedy produced at the Hal Roach Studios, "Isn't Life Terrible?" (1925), during a scene in which Chase is trying to sell fountain pens to Fay Wray.
