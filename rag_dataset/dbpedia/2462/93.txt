Barry Spicer's painting Operation Slipper - In Service Against Terrorism depicts soldiers of the Mentoring Task Force patrolling through a local village in the Uruzgan Valley during 2010. With a back drop of the steep mountains synonymous with the region the patrol draws interest from local children, as has been the case with many of the activities undertaken by Australians throughout their time in Afghanistan.

Accompanied by an Explosive Detection Dog and the Australian-designed Bushmaster vehicles, providing much needed mobility and protection against the many hazards of operations in Afghanistan, the soldiers wear the Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform, a move to recognise the uniqueness of the vegetation in the valleys of Uruzgan, as opposed to the Disruptive Pattern Desert Uniform seen in use for many years throughout the Middle East Area of Operations. Their weapons and equipment show a mix of the F88 Steyr, F80 Minimi and MAG58 General Purpose Machine Gun and variations of combat body armour systems and combat load carrying equipment in use at the time.

About the Artist

Barry Spicer is an internationally renown artist living in Adelaide, South Australia, whose main focus is on military subjects.

At the age of 6, he went to see the film “The Battle of Britain” and was so inspired by the sight of those graceful but deadly aeroplanes that he turned his already established pastime of drawing to aircraft. Since then he has been fascinated by flight and just about anything that flies which is evident in his finished works, be they drawings or oil paintings.
