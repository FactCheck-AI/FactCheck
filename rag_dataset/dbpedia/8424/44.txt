The last divided capital city in the world, after the fall of Berlin Wall, is the city of Nicosia here in Cyprus, through which runs the Green Line that divides north and south occupying the northern part since 20 July 1974 Turkish invasion. Nicosia is the largest town of Cyprus and has been the capital of the island since Medieval times (11th century AD). The history of the city is interesting and adventurous and the place itself is of great character, circled by old city walls and criss-crossed by twisting, teeming streets.

Ride by motor coach to visit St. John’s Cathedral built in 1662 by Archbishop Nikiforos, and admire the 18th century frescoes embellishing the walls, depicting colourful biblical scenes.

Far and away the most significant and magnificent collection of Cypriot antiquities is housed at the Cyprus Archaeological Museum, built in classical British style. Its treasures include artefacts dating from the Neolithic Age (7000 BC) to the early Byzantine period and Mycenaean relics. Ceramics, tomb-monuments, bronze statues and coins that span more than 5000 years of the island’s history are on display. Perhaps the most famous exhibit is the statue of Aphrodite from Soli - now the symbol of Cyprus.

Afterwards, a stop at the Green Line checkpoint at Ledra Street from where you will have the opportunity to gaze at the occupied half of Nicosia and northern territory of Cyprus.
