Despite scurrilous claims to the contrary Paul Lawrie – an Open champion in 1999 and multiple winner at the highest level – has always been a very fine golfer. He won again on the European Tour this year and after an opening-round 65 at the Dubai World Championship he is once again making his mark, taking an early lead in the final tournament of the 2011 season.

So much for know-nothing "experts" who called him an unworthy winner of golf's biggest event. Lawrie, one of life's more laidback souls, has always known how good a player he has been and can still be. Seven birdies and 11 pars around a brutally long Earth course at the Jumeirah golf estates in Dubai proved the point.

"You want to win tournaments, you want to compete. I want to be in the top 50 of the world rankings again. It's not a money thing that drives me on. I just want to be the best I can be," he said when asked what keeps him motivated.

The 41-year-old Scot arrived in Dubai on Monday, parked himself on the driving range shortly after the sun rose and hit balls until tea-time. "All of the world's top players will tell you that now and again you need you need to put in a solid day at the range like that," he said.

Lawrie also has two sons to impress, both of them fine golfers in their own right. Craig is 16 and plays off scratch, while Michael, aged 12, is a five-handicapper. "Both have beaten me this year off 'bare feet' [meaning he didn't give them any shots]. They are both very keen and have a bit of talent. They are miles ahead of where I was at the same stage and both are very competitive," he said. "That also drives me on – the fact that I want to be a decent player for them."

After Thursday's performance, the Lawrie boys can be reassured their old man can still play, as can anyone else who watched a top-class performance against a top-class field.
