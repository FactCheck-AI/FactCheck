No confirmation from NPR yet, but Fox News in Tampa Bay, Fla., is reporting that the so-called D.C. Madam, Deborah Jeane Palfrey, has killed herself.

In a story with a Tarpon Springs dateline, the Fox affiliate reports:

Police were called to the home of DC Madam Deborah Jeane Palfrey's mother on Thursday to investigate her apparent suicide.

Police have confirmed that the dead person is Palfrey who was 52.

Fox is seconded by a bulletin from the Associated Press.

Palfrey was convicted on April 15 of running an escort service in the Washington, D.C., area. Palfrey called it a "high-end erotic fantasy service." She argued that she hadn't known her escorts were trading sex for money. The Washington Post reported:

In a gray suit and black boots, her lips and nails stoplight-red as always and her dark hair swirled into a familiar bouffant, Palfrey stood, hands clasped at her waist, maintaining the poise she showed throughout her week-long trial. Then the clerk spoke, and she swayed a bit, lowering her chin ever so slightly and emitting a barely audible groan.

"Guilty," the clerk said four times -- guilty of racketeering, money laundering and two counts of using the mail for illegal purposes. The U.S. attorney's office said that under sentencing guidelines, Palfrey probably faces a prison term of four to six years.
