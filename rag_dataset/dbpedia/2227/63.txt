Carol Joynt, the owner of Nathan’s restaurant in Georgetown, scored a bit of a coup for her “Cafe Q+A” series: Deborah Jeane Palfrey, a.k.a the D.C. Madam, in her first interview since ABC News aired their now-infamous report on the case.

Somewhat disappointingly, Palfrey’s lawyer, Montgomery Blair Sibley, fielded most of Joynt’s questions because of a restraining order that prevents her from talking about her client “list.” Still, there were some revealing moments:

Joynt: Where is that list of names right now? At ABC?

Sibley: Probably at Disney headquarters.
