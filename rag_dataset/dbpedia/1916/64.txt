NINE-DART hero Michael Smith and emerging star Ricky Evans will contest the PDC Unicorn World Youth Championship Final in May after winning through the £40,000 tournament’s early rounds in Barnsley on Friday night.

The tournament, featuring players who competed on last year’s PDC Unicorn Youth Tour and a series of International Qualifiers, saw Smith joined in hitting a perfect leg by Kurt Parry.

Smith went on to win through to May’s final, which will be played during the McCoy’s Premier League Darts Play-Offs at The O2 in London, by showing some incredible form in winning five matches on Friday night.

The 22-year-old from St Helens dropped just one leg as he defeated Brandon Walsh, George Killington, Samuel Head and Dean Finn to reach the semi-finals – hitting a nine-darter in the opening leg of his last 16 game with Head.

Smith then defeated County Durham’s Adam Hunt 6-3 to win through to the final with another fine performance – which comes only a week after he had reached the final of a Speedy Services UK Open Qualifier on the senior circuit.

“I’ve been practising so well for the last few months and, since Christmas, I’ve put in an amazing amount of work so it’s great to see it paying off,” said Smith.

“I’m confident that I can keep this form going now and I’m really going to look forward to the final. I was shaking like a leaf in the semi-finals and it was brilliant to win it.”

Kettering’s Evans, meanwhile, won through to face Smith at The O2 by defeating 2011 World Youth Champion Arron Monk 6-3 in their semi-final.

Evans defeated Canada’s Shaun Narain in the first round and then saw off Australian youngster Harley Kemp before overcoming Chris Aubrey, Sam Hamilton and Monk.

The 22-year-old, a winner on the PDC Unicorn Youth Tour in 2011, has only ever competed on television once before, at the 2010 UK Open, but will compete in front of 10,000 fans in May when he competes for the World Youth Championship title.

Evans had turned professional in January when he won a PDC Tour Card at Qualifying School, and admitted: “Ever since Q School I’ve been on a high and this is something I’ve really wanted.

“I’m enjoying my darts so much at the moment. It’s a big step up for me and it will be the biggest crowd I’ve played in front of by miles, but it’s going to be an exciting two months waiting for the day to arrive!”

The pair will also now qualify for November’s William Hill Grand Slam of Darts, and are assured of a PDC Tour Card for 2014 and 2015, although both are currently Tour Card Holders.

Smith’s achievement in hitting a nine-dart finish came only minutes after 19-year-old Welshman Kurt Parry had hit a perfect leg during his second round win over Josh Jones.

Reigning champion James Hubbard was a first round casualty as he went down 6-4 to Matthew Dicken, while fellow seeds Jamie Lewis and Keegan Brown also lost at that stage, to Brandon Monk and Reece Robinson respectively.

Australian teenagers Harley Kemp and Jackson Wilson-Young both reached the last 32 following their around-the-world trips, and emerging German ace Max Hopp made it through to the last 16 before losing out to Sam Hamilton.

Hamilton picked up £1,500 as a quarter-final loser alongside Dutchman Ryan De Vreede, Jake Patchett and Irish qualifier Dean Finn.
