CASTLE: ONCE UPON A TIME’s Raphael Sbarge to Guest Star

Jiminy Cricket has been MIA for a bit on ONCE UPON A TIME, but his portrayer will be turning up on another ABC series soon: CASTLE!

A rep for ABC has confirmed that Raphael Sbarge (Jiminy on OUAT) will appear on the 20th episode of CASTLE this season as Dr. Darrell Meeks. (What role he plays in the episode is still unknown at this time, but Sbarge did post a photo of himself with CASTLE star Nathan Fillion earlier today.)

Are you excited to see Sbarge on CASTLE?
