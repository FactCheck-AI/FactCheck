LICENCE TO KILL was a new effort to try to "darken" the James Bond franchise, with a PG-13 rating, a use of harsher language, bloodier violence, and a plot that had Bond going rogue. But unfortunately these were superficial touches that didn't really help the movie at its core. Timothy Dalton was never a great choice as Bond, and neither of the Bond girls (Talisa Soto and Carey Lowell) are particularly interesting, nor even very good.

Meanwhile, director John Glen had been a second unit director on the Bond series since 1969 and had directed five of them himself; this was his fifth, and he seems tired. The movie often feels sloppy during certain fight scenes or lethargic during dialogue-driven scenes. But at least it was a step up from Roger Moore's ridiculous final entries, and it's still a fan favorite. Robert Davi makes a nasty villain, and Benicio Del Toro has an early role as a vicious thug. Las Vegas crooner Wayne Newton has a cameo, and Gladys Knight sings the theme song.
