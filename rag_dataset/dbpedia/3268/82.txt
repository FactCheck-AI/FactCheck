Once a possible gain for the Australian production industry, filming has started in the UK on Warner Bros. Pictures’ and Village Roadshow Pictures’ Jupiter Ascending, a science fiction feature from Lana and Andy Wachowski.

It stars Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis.

Australian producer Grant Hill, with whom the writer/directors have collaborated since The Matrix Trilogy, is still on board. Roberto Malerba and Bruce Berman are executive producers.
