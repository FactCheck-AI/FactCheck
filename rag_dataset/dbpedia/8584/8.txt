Go (golang) is stupidly easy to learn. It has good concurrency primitives (inspired by Erlang). Great tooling support: opinionated code formatter, Language Server Protocol, auto package import, native unit testing package, native fuzz testing package, in general, good base standard library. Fast compilation time. Compiles to statically linked binaries. Native support for cross-platform compilation. C++ level performance. Easy to write like an interpreted language… I could go on and on with a long list of —what I believe are— excellent features, but you get the idea.

C++ performance is debatable - but how many C++ projects are getting C++ performance? I'd say it's definitely a "good enough" for most anything out there without having to know the ins and outs of the standard. A very good trade off. If you need those extra micros, go to C++ or Rust.
