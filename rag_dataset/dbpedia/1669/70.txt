Anthony Edwards produced a game-high 27 points, while Jaden McDaniels had 21 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 10 points, 13 rebounds and five assists to lead the Timberwolves to their second Game 7 in franchise history.

The loss by the Nuggets in Game 6 was the largest by a defending champion in history. They were held to 14 points in the first quarter and nine in the fourth quarter, tied for the fewest points scored in a quarter in franchise history.

Most Valuable Player Nikola JokiÄ‡ led the Nuggets with 22 points and nine rebounds, and Aaron Gordon had 12 points, eight rebounds and four assists. The team finished with 26 field goals, the second-fewest allowed by the Timberwolves in the playoffs.
