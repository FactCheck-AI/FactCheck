The 2004 NBA draft followed what was considered one of the most exceptional draft classes in the history of the league.

As such, it didn’t quite measure up in terms of top-tier talent. Nonetheless, it did boast a considerable depth of proficient players, many of whom went on to have lengthy careers in the NBA, effectively becoming valuable role players.

Below, check out our 2004 NBA re-draft, with players taken in the order they should have gone in.

No. 1 pick: Dwight Howard

It’s somewhat rare for the actual No. 1 pick to go first overall in our re-drafts but for 2004, that’s exactly what happened here. Dwight Howard won Defensive Player of the Year three times, was an eight-time All-Star, led the league in blocks twice and rebounding five times and was 1st Team All-NBA five times, too. The best center in the league during his prime, Howard was a two-way force of nature, leading the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals and eventually winning a championship as a vital backup for the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. Oh, and for those who want to argue it, there’s no doubt Howard will be a Hall-of-Famer one day. Probably a first-ballot Hall-of-Famer, at that.

Actual position: No. 1

Career earnings: $245,142,483

Career stats: 15.7 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 1.8 bpg, 58.7 FG%, 56.7 FT%

Scouting Report

No. 2 pick: Andre Iguodala

Another potential Hall-of-Famer (though his case isn’t as clear cut) from the 2004 draft class is Andre Iguodala, who goes second overall in our re-draft exercise. Iguodala was another two-way player, a do-everything swingman on offense who could score, rebound and create, and a point-stopper on the other end, who could take on tough matchups on the wing and cause havoc as a help defender. A one-time All-Star, Iguodala won four titles as a member of the Golden State Warriors, including one run in which he earned Finals MVP, which happened in 2015.

Actual position: No. 9

Career earnings: $189,621,801

Career stats: 11.3 ppg, 4.9 rpg, 4.2 apg, 46.3 FG%, 33.0 3P%

Scouting Report

No. 3 pick: Luol Deng

And that’s where the line of Hall-of-Famers or potential Hall-of-Famers from the 2004 class ends. Still, Luol Deng was a high-level player for many years, another two-way wing, though one with a bit less impact than Iguodala had. A two-time All-Star, Deng was particularly effective as a slasher and could hit spot-up threes as well as some midrange off-the-dribble jumpers in his prime, and could really defend opposing All-Star-level wings.

Actual position: No. 7

Career earnings: $168,520,376

Career stats: 14.8 ppg, 6.1 rpg, 2.3 apg, 45.6 FG%, 33.2 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 4 pick: Al Jefferson

A throwback player, Al Jefferson was a low-block specialist with great quickness and footwork as a post-up player, who would often humiliate opposing big men who would try to defend him in the paint. He didn’t offer much in the way of defense but he was one of the smoothest big men scorers in the NBA and even earned 3rd Team All-NBA honors in 2013-14 for his efforts.

Actual position: No. 15

Career earnings: $133,787,578

Career stats: 15.7 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 1.5 apg, 49.9 FG%, 71.1 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 5 pick: Josh Smith

Although not the most efficient player even in his prime, Josh Smith was one of the most exciting players to watch in his heyday thanks to his otherworldly athleticism to go with his fantastic length on the wing. A highlight-dunk specialist, Smith could do damage as a slasher, in transition and as a help defender, but his obsession with launching threes despite his poor success rate hindered his impact.

Actual position: No. 17

Career earnings: $118,735,184

Career stats: 14.5 ppg, 7.4 rpg, 3.1 apg, 45.2 FG%, 63.2 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 6 pick: Devin Harris

A lightning-quick point guard with good finishing ability in the paint and solid playmaking skills, albeit with a streaky jumper, Devin Harris was part of some very talented Dallas Mavericks teams that had championship aspirations, making the playoffs eight times in his career with three different teams.

Actual position: No. 5

Career earnings: $74,241,850

Career stats: 10.8 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 3.9 apg, 43.2 FG%, 79.6 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 7 pick: Jameer Nelson

Despite his lack of size and mundane athleticism, Jameer Nelson had an impressive career that lasted 14 seasons, one of which was an All-Star campaign, and was a member of the 2008-09 Orlando Magic team that reached the NBA Finals. Nelson missed the second half of that season and the majority of the playoffs before returning far from 100 percent for the final five games, causing us to wonder if that championship series against Los Angeles might have gone differently with a fully healthy, All-Star-level Nelson.

Actual position: No. 20

Career earnings: $73,867,486

Career stats: 11.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.1 apg, 43.6 FG%, 36.8 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 8 pick: JR Smith

JR Smith probably wasn’t the most team-oriented player ever, often looking for his own shot as his first, second and third option, but he was an explosive scorer who could shoot from all over the floor against all types of contests and fly out of the gym with his plus-athleticism. He won Sixth Man of the Year in 2012-13 after averaging 18.1 points off the bench for the New York Knicks that year and also won two championships, one with the Cleveland Cavaliers and one with the Lakers.

Actual position: No. 18

Career earnings: $90,294,854

Career stats: 12.4 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 2.1 apg, 41.9 FG%, 37.3 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 9 pick: Kevin Martin

Had Kevin Martin, a late bloomer as a basketball player, attended a bigger college than Western Carolina University, he probably wouldn’t have fallen to 26th in his draft class. Regardless, he wound up having a very solid NBA career, providing high-level scoring thanks to his quickness and off-the-dribble shooting, even with the funky release he had on his jumper.

Actual position: No. 26

Career earnings: $79,403,668

Career stats: 17.4 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 1.9 apg, 43.7 FG%, 87.0 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 10 pick: Emeka Okafor

Big man Emeka Okafor hit the ground running in his NBA career, averaging a double-double for the first five seasons of his career along with nearly two blocks nightly. But by his late-20s, his prime was pretty much over, as injuries eventually took their toll on him. He wasn’t a full-on bust but Okafor never made an All-Star team and didn’t really live up the expectations of a No. 2 overall pick.

Actual position: No. 2

Career earnings: $88,681,573

Career stats: 12.0 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 1.6 bpg, 51.2 FG%, 58.6 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 11 pick: Vassilis Spanoulis

Jeff Van Gundy was no fan of his, as the ball-handling, bombastic shooting guard Vassilis Spanoulis played just 272 minutes in his lone NBA season with the Rockets. But in Europe, he’s an absolute legend. He’ll go down as one of the most clutch players in FIBA basketball.

Actual position: No. 50

Euroleague career stats: 12.4 ppg, 4.5 apg, 32.1 3P%

No. 12 pick: Anderson Varejao

He was never a star but Anderson Varejao was a very solid role player for many years, even peaking in 2012-13 at 14.1 points, 14.4 rebounds and 3.4 assists per game. The Brazilian was an expert finisher out of the pick-and-roll and moved his feet very well, helping him last All-Defensive Team honors in 2009-10.

Actual position: No. 30

Career earnings: $88,929,857

Career stats: 7.2 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 1.2 apg, 50.9 FG%, 63.0 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 13 pick: Delonte West

A tough-nosed two-way player in his prime, Delonte West was a lefty guard who provided a lot of toughness and quick feet defensively and could really shoot the basketball, either with his feet set or off the dribble.

Actual position: No. 24

Career earnings: $16,463,022

Career stats: 9.7 ppg, 2.9 rpg, 3.6 apg, 44.8 FG%, 37.2 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 14 pick: Shaun Livingston

The No. 4 pick in 2004, Shaun Livingston’s career could be seen as a relative disappointment relative to the expectations as a Top 5 pick with outstanding size and athleticism for a point guard. But the reason Livingston wasn’t able to live up to the hype was in large part due to the horrifying leg injury he suffered in 2007-08 (seriously, don’t look up video of it), one that took him a long while to recover from. Even so, Livingston was a three-time champion with the Warriors, playing an absolutely pivotal role as a backup for the Golden State dynasty as a scorer and playmaker off the bench.

Actual position: No. 4

Career earnings: $59,164,536

Career stats: 6.3 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 3.0 apg, 48.6 FG%, 79.4 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 15 pick: Trevor Ariza

Trevor Ariza never became a star in the NBA but for a second-round pick, he had a fantastic career, earning over $116 million during his time in the Association, winning a championship with the Lakers in 2008-09 and producing as a 3-and-D swingman for a long time.

Actual position: No. 43

Career earnings: $116,874,668

Career stats: 10.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 2.1 apg, 42.2 FG%, 35.1 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 16 pick: Tony Allen

One of the best guard defenders of his generation, Tony Allen was an absolute force on the less glamorous end of the floor, capable of locking down opposing star ball-handlers on a nightly basis. Allen was a three-time 1st Team All-Defense member and a three-time 2nd Team All-Defender, which goes to show what a beast he was as a point-preventer. His offensive game wasn’t much to write home about but he could knock down midrange jumpers here and there.

Actual position: No. 25

Career earnings: $40,941,056

Career stats: 8.1 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 1.3 apg, 47.5 FG%, 28.2 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 17 pick: Ben Gordon

An explosive scorer who could shoot from all over the floor, even off the dribble, thanks to his high elevation and quick release, Ben Gordon won Sixth Man of the Year in 2004-05 as a rookie after averaging 15.1 points mostly off the bench for the Chicago Bulls that campaign. Gordon even had a couple of campaigns where he averaged over 20 points per game back when that was a much bigger accomplishment than it is today, as his relentless running to get open coming off of screens made him a load to defend.

Actual position: No. 3

Career earnings: $82,353,604

Career stats: 14.9 ppg, 2.5 rpg, 2.5 apg, 43.2 FG%, 40.1 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 18 pick: Beno Udrih

A solid backup point guard for many years, Beno Udrih didn’t spend a whole lot of time as a full-time starter but he did have his moments of good impact thanks to his playmaking and pull-up midrange shooting skills.

Actual position: No. 28

Career earnings: $43,297,950

Career stats: 8.4 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 3.4 apg, 46.3 FG%, 34.9 3P%

Career Salary Info

No. 19 pick: Andris Biedrins

There was a time it looked like Andris Biedrins might live up to the expectations of a lottery-level pick, as the big man even peaked in 2008-09 at 11.9 points, 11.2 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game. However, his career was over fewer than 200 games later as his porous foul shooting led to his demise. Biedrins started to avoid contact in order not to have to shoot free throws – just look here to see why…

… – and without his physicality, he lost his main method of making an impact.

Actual position: No. 11

No. 20 pick: Kris Humphries

Best remembered for his 72-day marriage to Kim Kardashian,Kris Humphries was a solid role player during his time in the NBA, able to knock down midrange jumpers and rebound a bit out of the frontcourt.

Actual position: No. 14

Career earnings: $60,978,258

Career stats: 6.7 ppg, 5.4 rpg, 0.7 apg, 46.3 FG%, 70.0 FT%

Career Salary Info

No. 21 pick: Josh Childress

A solid double-digit scorer for the first few years of his career, the smooth midrange attacker Josh Childress never really progressed being just a decent secondary bucket-getter. The most interesting thing about his career, actually, was that after his rookie contract ended, he signed in Greece with Olympiacos where he became a star in the Greek League before returning to the NBA for four more uneventful seasons prior to ending his career overseas. That was a noteworthy moment for the NBA, however, as it led some to wonder if more NBA players would choose to continue their careers in European basketball during their primes. (Spoiler alert: That never really became a thing and with the money the NBA is currently shelling out, it never will.)

No. 22 pick: Chris Duhon

A solid playmaker and outside shooter, Chris Duhon peaked in 2008-09 as a member of the Knicks under head coach Mike D’Antoni and his blazing-fast system, averaging 11.1 points and 7.2 assists that year while shooting 39.1 percent from three. Besides that, Duhon never had another double-digit scoring season and was mostly just a low-end starter, high-end backup type in his prime.
