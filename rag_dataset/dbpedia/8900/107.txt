Polica (formed in 2011) is an American indie, synth pop, alternative rock group hailing from Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the U.S.

The band is formed of Ryan Olson on production and singer Channy Leaneagh. Leaneagh spawned from a musical family and attended Ramsey Fine Arts School where she learned to dance, play the violin and perform. After graduating from high school Leaneagh met Alexei Casselle who became an acoustic duo and in 2005 married. The pair formed folk-rock duo Roma di Luna and released three independent albums together.

After the professional break up of Roma di Luna and personal break-up of her marriage, Leaneagh was looking for something novel and Ryan Olsen invited her to join his Ganyngs supergroup project alongside Justin Vernon, P.O.S., Har Mar Superstar and members of Megafaun. After which Olsen convinced the singer to experiment with a synth pop, R&B sound and enlisted the help of Chris Bierden on bass and back-up vocals, and Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu on drums.

Poliça released their debut album in February 2012 on the label Totally Gross National Product founded by Drew Christopherson and Ryan Olsen. The album features strong manipulation of the singers voice and received positive critical acclaim. The band subsequently played SXSW festival and became known for their intense live-performances across the U.S. and Europe with their funky bass and powerful pair of drummers.

The band followed their debut up with “Shulamith” in 2013, named after the feminist Shulamith Firestone. The album reached No. 33 in the UK Albums charts and its lead single “Tiff” features the experienced voice of Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon.

Poliça....is it a Latinate name for the local force, the Spanish bobby? Apparently not. According to the Minneapolis five-piece the name is Polish for “policy”, an unwritten code that the band members live and record by, and it’s certainly done them just fine so far after two albums and a series of much-talked-about live performances. 2012’s Give You the Ghost and 2013’s Shulamith marked Poliça out as a top-notch electronic pop band with more than a hint of recycled trip hop to their remarkable rhythms. Producer and general recluse Ryan Olsen (he refuses to appear live with the band) describes the music as “Drums, bass, synths, me, women” and that’s a pretty fair reflection of what you hear when you see this band live. You’re immediately taken by the stage presence of the elfin Channy Leaneagh, who writhes and dances in front of her banks of synths before unleashing her stunning voice, which is often treated with effects that only make the impact that more powerful. Poliça use two drummers when playing live, and their timing is impeccable; you will never catch Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu out of step with each other and this means that tracks like ‘Dark Star’, ‘Lay Your Cards Out’ and the clattering ‘Chain My Name’ become powerful beyond what’s on the record, but never overpowering the captivating Leaneagh. Given Leaneagh’s passion for feminism it’s always worth sticking around for a Polica encore as you’ll hear a cover of Lesley Gore’s ‘You Don’t Own Me’. It’s stunning simply for her naked vocal, reminding you that while you can throw all the instrumentation you like at a live show, the singer will always be the star when she’s got a voice that’ll stop you in your tracks.

Unfortunately the concert was not as good as it has could have been. The sound mixing was horrible with too much und bad basses leaving Channys vocals behind. Herself seemed very shy and stressed out with very little contact to her fans. Badly there were many unknown songs and only little old ones what made the concert not very easy going. The whole gig was far too short, too with only one encore, what left me little disappointing. Hopefully Polica learns more about good live performance in the future as they are very good musicians after all.

German Version:

Leider war das Konzert von Polica nicht so schön wie es hätte sein können. Vor allem der Tontechniker mit der Abstimmung des Sounds hat total versagt und die Musik zu laut und zu basslästig unausgewogen übersteuert, was zu einem ständigen Boxendröhnen führte und die Stimme von Channy überdröhnte und sie auch selbst nervte. Sie war irgendwie nicht gut in Form, sehr scheu und fast ohne Kontakt zum Publikum. Da man die neuen Songs auch noch nicht kannte war der Wiedererkennungswort kaum da und Stimmung beim Publikum kam dadurch leider nicht richtig auf, nur immer dann wenn es mal ein altes Stück gab und das war selten genug - und Highlights wie z.B. Dark Star fehlten ganz. Enttäuschend war auch die Länge, bzw. Kürze des Konzerts mit einer guten Stunde und einer kurzen Zugabe.

Möchte Polica erfolgreicher werden bedarf es wohl noch einiger Bühnenarbeit, bei dem schnellen Ausverkauf der Karten gibt es ja doch immer mehr und viele Fans der ja eigentlich sehr guten Musiker

Little lady makes big noise at the Roundhouse.

I always worry when a band uses up it's better known numbers by halfway through the concert: are they playing a short set it are they worried about keeping the crowd engaged.

Not a problem last night as this was a confident and sometimes mesmerising performance.

Two big and powerful drummers and a bassist and then Chany. Her voice is unique, even with echo and distortion. It is the songs which provides a jazz feel to some of the numbers and you can see her concetrating on the accuracy of the notes, though she seemed to be having problems with her ear piece.Perhaps a bit more contact with the crowd woukd have helped.

My other gripe is the use of pre recorded tracks. The rhythm was powerful and live but the "tunes" were all backing tracks. I'd have liked a fifth band member, even if they were just pressing buttons on a key board. Seeing no one on stage playing while music was belting out is always disconcerting: not quite live!

But I loved the range of the songs , the pounding rhythms and above all her voice.

I am still within the firm opinion that Poliça are one of the most exciting things to happen to alt-pop music in quite a long time. The debut album 'Give You A Ghost' was a masterclass in moody, dark and downtempo indietronica and quickly gained the band a cult-like following and the esteem deserved from a number of respected publications.

This evening the group is lead onto stage by a bright eyed Channy Leaneagh who comes dressed appropriately all in black. Playing their debut album in its near entirety allows the audience to step inside the twisted world and view every twist, turn and change in these complex synth pop packets. 'Amongster' is equally as brooding as the record version whilst 'I See My Mother' has a wonderfully hypnotic quality. Poliça are undoubtedly an acquired taste due to the complexity of their narratives and the sonar structures of their music yet for those who invest the time, the rewards are staggering.

Poliça far succeeded my expectations! At the start of their set they placed several songs from United Crushers. Maybe its due to not listening to the newest album enough, but it these songs did not seem to flow as well with me as I know their previous albums do. However, they looked quite in sync with what they were playing in terms of enjoyment. Then they switched to their old content... And it was magical! The music pulsed the room, Channy Leaneagh vocals were so on point, and the change in sound from new to old felt so much more natural. "Very Cruel" was explosive and spiritual. By the end, when they played a couple more songs from United Crushers, I was completely sold this new record. The lighting game was also perfect!

We saw Polica performing the final show of their United Crushers spring US tour at The Bottleneck in Lawrence,KS. Chaney was great and the band was exceptional. They had limited conversation with crowd during a 1 1/2 hour long set, but their music was very tight and well received by about 150 fans that were clearly very well versed in Polica's work.

The encore consisted of two songs including a great version of "Chain My Name" that had the crowd moving. They performed a mix of songs from their 3 albums.

Ok so the concert was good. Polica were on form, haunting music delivered with a new line up of musicians that played an array of different instruments very well. Channy was mesmeric. However Give You the Ghost was by far their best album and so it was a disappointment not to hear any of the tracks from that album, shame really because their collaboration with Stargaze is a way forward for them musically but please do not forget your roots and what you managed to produce on your own.

"Lime Habit" was performed with passion and style- as were the other tunes, but the best part was watching the dual drum sets! Most all their songs, except Lime Habit, began rather slow, yet the direction was clear and each one ended with solid vibes- just making you want more. A band going places for sure. Opening band was MOTHXR - another band who is able to creatively blend the dark side with solid rhythm: think " Stranger". Would love to see both bands again!!
