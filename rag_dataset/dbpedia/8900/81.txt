A little bit synthpop, a little bit alternative rock, and a little bit trip hop, Minneapolis-based Polica guide themselves with an unwritten code. According to lead singer Channy Leaneagh, the band lends its name to the Polish word for “policy” but also came about as the result of a corrupted file name after what could now be considered a fortuitous computer crash.

Either way the group expands its studio sound from just Leaneagh and producer Ryan Olson include bassist/vocalist Chris Bierden, and drummers Drew Christopherson and Ben Ivascu to fill out the stage for live performances. You didn’t misread that; Polica plays with two drum kits on stage, providing a percussive energy not found in many other groups. Receiving support and acclaim from acts like Gayngs, Bon Iver, and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Polica has managed to create quite a buzz since coming together in 2011.

Live performances from their 2012 debut album Give You the Ghost garnered attention at SXSW, where Leaneagh made heavy use of effects pedals to manipulate and stylize her signature vocals. In 2013 Polica released their single Tiff, featuring Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon and an accompanying music video. The full-length Shulamith was issued shortly afterward, following promotional appearances on BBC2 and BBC6 and charting in Belgium, France, Switzerland and the UK.

Now back in the United States and touring across the nation, you can catch Polica on Saturday, October 11th at Austin City Limits or stream some of their latest work right here!
