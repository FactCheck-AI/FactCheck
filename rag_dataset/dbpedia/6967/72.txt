SEASON 2 - EPISODE 34 - CAROLINE THOMPSON - WRITER / DIRECTOR

Team Deakins is happy to share our conversation with writer, director, and novelist Caroline Thompson (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, BLACK BEAUTY, THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS). We talk about the life of a screenwriter and the commitment Caroline demonstrated throughout her career. No other episode has featured this much discussion on animals and filmmaking! We cover working with horses on BLACK BEAUTY, apes on BUDDY, and birds in THE SECRET GARDEN. Caroline offers insight into the creative and logistical challenges of working with animals and of their unpredictable but inimitable benefits when compared to their digital counterparts. Towards the end of our conversation, Caroline also shares some straightforward advice for young screenwriters and filmmakers. Enjoy the episode!
