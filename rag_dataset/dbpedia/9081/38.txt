Metropolitan Manila encompasses six cities and 12 towns. Located on Manila Bay in the South China Sea, and bisected by the Pasig River, the capital of the Philippines is historic and modern, rich and poor. A popular sight is the Intramuros, a walled area that was the capital during Spanish rule. Intramuros has retained old dungeons and gunpowder rooms but added art galleries and theatres. The city is filled with museums, shops, parks and churches, plus enough nightlife to last until dawn.
