An innovation lab designed to optimize future network systems, jointly built by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ), Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and Huawei, was inaugurated in CUHK-SZ in Longgang District yesterday morning.

Luo Zhiquan, director of Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data and vice president of CUHK-SZ, said at the inauguration ceremony that the purpose of the lab is to use mathematics to resolve difficulties on network structure.

The lab will invite internationally renowned scientists to also explore solutions from aspects such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, said Luo.

Li Zhuowen, deputy secretary general of the Shenzhen Municipal Government, said at the ceremony that Shenzhen has always believed in the role of innovation in the cityâs development.

The building of the lab will enable the university, the research institute and the company to complement each otherâs advantages so as to promote the deeply integrated development of education, research and industry as well as international collaboration on science and technology, according to Li.

Huang Huibo, vice head of Longgang District, observed that the lab will attract top resources to enhance independent research and development capacity and to advance the development of the communications industry.

Xu Wenwei, president of Huaweiâs Institute of Strategic Research, said after the ceremony that the lab will not only focus on communication between human beings but also between human beings and robots, and will contribute to the stability, security and reliability of the network systems, which needs efforts from mathematicians, AI scientists, experts from Huawei and operators.

It is reported that the lab, led by Luo, will connect prominent scientists and engineers from around the globe to address difficult topics in the communications industry, to promote the application of mathematics and AI in future network systems, and to maximize the experience and performance of the network systems.
