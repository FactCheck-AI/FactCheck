Lorna Doone is based on the oft-filmed novel by Richard D. Blackmore. Set in 17th century

Scotland during the reign of Britain's Charles II, the story concerns young Lorna (Barbara

Hale), a member of a much-hated landowning family. Lorna falls in love with a humble

villager (Richard Greene), who like the rest of community has suffered under the rule of the

despotic Doones. The villagers revolt against their oppressors, but when it is revealed that

Lorna is not a genuine Doone, she is able to marry her low-born swain. Star Barbara Hale

was pregnant throughout the filming of Lorna Doone; thus it can be said that the film

"co-starred" her son, future actor William Katt.
