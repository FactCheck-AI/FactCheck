A study of the type material of Antarctic species of conoideans described by Herman Strebel revealed that four species, all originally described in the genus Bela Gray, 1847 (Mangeliidae), are referable to the superfamily Buccinoidea based on radular morphology. Three of the species: B.fluvicans, B. minor, and B. anderssoni are transferred to the genus Falsimohnia, which is here reviewed. The new buccinoidean genus Strebela is proposed for the species originally described as Bela notophila. Of the five species of the conchologically similar genus Pareuthria Strebel, 1905 that have been recorded within the Antarctic Convergence, two, Pareuthria innocens (Smidi, 1907) and P. hoshiaii Numanami, 1996, are transferred to the genus Falsimohnia based on radular morphology. The appropriate generic allocation of Pareuthria plicata Thiele, 1912 is not yet clear; however, major differences in radular morphology exclude it from the genus Pareuthria. The taxa Pareuthria valdiviae (Thiele, 1925) and Pareuthria turriformis Egorova, 1982 are presently known only from their shell morphology. We suggest that they will be referred to other genera when anatomical material becomes available, and that the genus Pareuthria will be limited to the Magellanic region.

In the course of preparation of a new molecular phylogeny of Conoidea based on exon-capture some new species and species with notable morphology were revealed. The taxonomy of these species is discussed and the radula of most of them illustrated for the first time. New genera are described: Comispira gen. nov. (Cochlespiridae), type species Leucosyrinx mai Li et Li, 2008; Pagodaturris gen. nov. (Clavatulidae), type species Pleurotoma molengraaffi Tesch, 1915. New species described: Comispira compta gen. et sp. nov., Sibogasyrinx sangeri sp. nov. (both Cochlespiridae), Pagodaturris philippinensis gen. et sp. nov. (Clavatulidae), Horaiclavus micans sp. nov., Iwaoa invenusta sp. nov. (both Horaiclavidae), Lucerapex cracens sp. nov., Lucerapex laevicarinatus sp. nov. (Turridae), Heteroturris kanacospira sp. nov. (Borsoniidae). Epideira Hedley, 1918 is reallocated from Pseudomelatomidae to Horaiclavidae. The radulae of Kuroshioturris nipponica (Shuto, 1961) (Turridae), Leucosyrinx verrillii (Dall, 1881), and Leucosyrinx luzonica (Powell, 1969) comb. nov. are illustrated for the first time.

The anatomy and evolution of the radular apparatus in predatory marine gastropods of the superfamily Conoidea is reconstructed on the basis of a molecular phylogeny, based on three mitochondrial genes (COI, 12S and 16S) for 102 species. A unique feeding mechanism involving use of individual marginal radular teeth at the proboscis tip for stabbing and poisoning of prey is here assumed to appear at the earliest stages of evolution of the group. The initial major evolutionary event in Conoidea was the divergence to two main branches. One is characterized by mostly hypodermic marginal teeth and absence of an odontophore, while the other possesses a radula with primarily duplex marginal teeth, a strong subradular membrane and retains a fully functional odontophore. The radular types that have previously been considered most ancestral, “prototypic” for the group (flat marginal teeth; multicuspid lateral teeth of Drilliidae; solid recurved teeth of Pseudomelatoma and Duplicaria), were found to be derived conditions. Solid recurved teeth appeared twice, independently, in Conoidea — in Pseudomelatomidae and Terebridae. The Terebridae, the sister group of Turridae, are characterized by very high radular variability, and the transformation of the marginal radular teeth within this single clade repeats the evolution of the radular apparatus across the entire Conoidea.

A unique radular configuration for Conoidea, consisting of five teeth in a transverse row (acuspate platelike central and laterals, and duplex marginal teeth), was found in three species previously described in the genus Clavatula: C. delphinae, C. pseudomystica and C. christianae. Analysis of the COI gene demonstrated that they belong to the family Clavatulidae. Paraclavatula n. gen. is described. No similar radulae have been found previously among Conoidea and their morphology suggests that the presence of well-defined lateral teeth is more broadly distributed within Conoidea than previously anticipated. Based on radular morphology alone, it would not be possible to attribute the genus to any presently recognized family of Conoidea.
