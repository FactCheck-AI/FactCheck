Warner Bros. has revealed October as the start date for director Gary Ross's "Ocean's Eleven" female spinoff, and confirmed further details on its principal cast.

The studio has reportedly closed deals with Anne Hathaway, singer Rihanna, Helena Bonham Carter, Mindy Kaling and Nora Lum (aka Asian-American rapper Awkwafina), in addition to already-confirmed actresses Sandra Bullock and Cate Blanchett for the film -- titled "Ocean's Eight" -- which follows on from the original "Ocean's Eleven" trilogy (via Deadline).

Ocean's Eleven director Steven Soderbergh is also attached to produce, with the script penned by Ross and Olivia Milch, however, it seems the picture is still casting for the eighth member of its star line-up (given the title).
