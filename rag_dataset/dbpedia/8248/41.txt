CVK’s own Bob Barton was one of three candidates considered for the state’s next federal judge. The process started with over 30 applicants of whom seven were interviewed by a Judicial Screening Committee in Portland. That committee submitted Bob’s name along with US Magistrate Dennis Hubel and Washington County Circuit Court Judge Marco Hernandez to Oregon Senators Smith and Wyden for submission to the President. Those candidates traveled to Washington DC for separate interviews.

Once the screening process is complete, one final candidate is selected for the US District Court position. FBI background checks and Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation will follow in the fall of 2008.

Bob, a seasoned trial attorney, has been a partner at CVK since 1989, specializing in personal injury, product liability, trucking, and commercial litigation. Prior to joining the firm, he was an Oregon Assistant Attorney General.
