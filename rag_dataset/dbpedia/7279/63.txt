24 Hour Party People tells the true story of Factory Records head honcho Tony Wilson.

Back Cover Synopsis[]

"IN YOUR FACE! OUTSPOKEN! ROARINGLY FUNNY! DEFIANTLY SEXUAL!" -Rolling Stone

"Magnificent" (The New York Times), "amazing" (The Los Angeles Times) and "a blast" (Rolling Stone), this true story of the raucous anti-establishment explosion that rocked the music industry is "miraculous...one of the smartest, liveliest, most engaging and revolving works you're likely to see this year" (Premiere)!

Blown away by an unknown local band called the Sex Pistols, TV personality Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) is inspired to invent an uniquely anarchic record label. Soon he's promoting everyone from Happy Mondays to New Order on his newly formed Factory Records...and partying like a rock star. From Tony's speedy rise to Factory's hedonistic fall, this "wonderful party of a movie stamps on a smiley face that will linger for hours" (New York Post).
