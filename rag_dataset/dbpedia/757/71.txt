The Washington University Law Review is a student-run academic journal that seeks to publish legally related scholarly articles. The Law Review seeks to foster dialogue on interesting legal issues both within the law school and in the broader legal community.

The Law Review was founded in 1915. Originally inaugurated as the St. Louis Law Review, the journal was retitled to the Washington University Law Quarterly in 1936, and further renamed to the Washington University Law Review in 2006. The Washington University Law Review Online was founded in 2017 to supplement the Law Reviewâ€™s print edition. It features shorter-form pieces analyzing cutting-edge legal issues.

Law Review editors select, edit, and publish notes, articles, and comments on various subjects within legal scholarship. Each piece undergoes a rigorous editing process wherein Law Review editors suggest global changes to substance and form, check text for accuracy and clarity, ensure that propositions have adequate support, and correct citations. The Law Review publishes six issues per year.
