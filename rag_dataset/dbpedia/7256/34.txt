Within These Walls | 48 HOUR FILM

Alt Title: Forbici da Cinema

Roles: Everything

On the weekend of March 27th - 29th, 2020, I created a short film in 48 hours for the #StuckAtHome48! It was a big event put on by the 48 hour film project that went on around the globe with over 1000+ teams (I think)!!

Hereâ€™s the link to the website with the challenge information!

The premise of the challenge was that due to the COVID virus outbreak, everyone is inside quarantining. So why not use all this strange/weird/stressful time alone in isolation to make a film in 48 hours! So the 48 Hour Film Project decided to create an impromptu 48-hour filmmaking challenge! Here is our film that Rizzo-house-clan created! Made in 48 hours from Friday to Sunday!

STORY:

In this film, Blake must make a 48-hour film with his stuffed animals alone after his family doesn't want to help make a film. So I had a lot of fun recreating movies with whatever I had and, for the most part, on my own!
