THE FALL 2018 title from Propeller Books, the publishing imprint of Propeller magazine, is The Devil Says Maybe I Like It, an essay collection by Wendy Bourgeois. The title will be released on October 30, 2018, but is available for pre-order now. Along with a foreword by poet Daneen Bergland, the book will feature previously-published pieces from Bourgeois’ popular “Reading Lines” columns, as well as new pieces written just for the book. The Devil Says Maybe I Like It is Bourgeois’ first book, and the eighth title from Propeller Books.

Wendy Bourgeois is a poet, a teacher, and a staff writer at Propeller, where âReading Lines,â her column on poetry and life, has run for the past several years. The Devil Says Maybe I Like It reveals that in addition to the humor, intelligence, and insight Bourgeois offers in her responses to poetry and philosophy, she also has the ability to craft, in just a few words, indelible sketches of children and parents, lovers and friends. Together, the pieces in the collection acquire the character of a subtle memoir, both intimate and cultural, from a fiercely intelligent woman assessing the power and predicaments to be discovered not only in literature, but in life itself.

From the foreword by Daneen Bergland:

âThese essays are dishy, spoken in the voice of a confidant, as Bourgeois tucks each poetâs line inside a closet of her own stories, secrets, and desires. Whatâs astonishing is the way she can unpack an idea, a feeling, an experience, or an especially dense or opaque line of poetry so deftly and completely, as if picking apart a hopeless knot in an impossibly delicate chain. Once untangled, a truth sparkles under the beam of her bright intelligence. Though the pieces reckon with literature and theory across time, the ageless themes are housed firmly in their modern context: Power, Death, Religion, Marriage, Beauty, Femininity, Motherhood, Love, God. If poetry is a distillation, these essays offer a concentrated drop of truth reconstituted in a personal and cultural moment.â
