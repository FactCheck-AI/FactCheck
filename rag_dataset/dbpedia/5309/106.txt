Yeah Wiz Khalifa is affiliated with the East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips, he got put on to the set by his close friend Snoop Dogg(who is also a member of this set). His song Black & Yellow is giving out a subliminal shout out to the set(as well as his hometown Pittsburgh), because the East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips wear the colors black and yellow(as well as the traditional blue) & wear pittsburh steelers clothing such as hats & jerseys.

SIDE NOTE:

*Most the rappers that are signed to Wiz Khalifa's record label Taylor Gang Records are affiliated with the East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips & some are Bloods involved with the Rollin 20's Neighborhood Bloods.

Is Wiz Khalifa a blood?

Wiz Khalifa is affiliated with the same Crip set Snoop Dogg is affiliated with, which is the East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips(so I've heard). A lot of people in Taylor Gang that are in a gang are either Crips or Bloods and they either claiming East Side Long Beach Rollin 20's Crips or West Side Rollin 20's Neighborhood Bloods.
