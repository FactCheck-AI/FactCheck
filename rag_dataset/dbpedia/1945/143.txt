A quarterback and kicker with excellent leadership qualities, Jim Turner was a member of two Skyline Conference Championship teams in 1960 and 1961 that combined for an 18-3-1 record, including a 9-1-1 Skyline Eight mark, and back-to-back bowl appearances as USU played in the 1960 Sun Bowl and the 1961 Gotham Bowl. During his Utah State career, Turner's teams combined for a 26-5-1 record, which are the most wins in a three-year period in school history. As a two-year starter at quarterback, Turner ranked 12th in the nation in scoring with 70 points during his senior season as he had six rushing touchdowns, three field goals and 25 extra points. Turner also ranked 17th in the nation in scoring during his junior season with 58 points as he accounted for three rushing touchdowns, two field goals and 34 extra points. During his career, he had a career-long pass of 73 yards against Western Michigan and a career-long punt of 63 yards against BYU both during his junior season. Turner also recorded a 100-yard fumble return for a touchdown against Idaho during his senior season, which still ranks as the longest fumble return for touchdown in school history. All-time, Turner still ranks tied for seventh all-time in school history with his 64 extra point attempts and 10th all-time with his 55 made extra points. He finished his career 49-of-95 passing for 789 yards with seven touchdowns. He also carried the ball 64 times for 273 yards with nine touchdowns. Following his collegiate career, Turner was selected by the Washington Redskins in the 1963 NFL Draft, before spending seven seasons with the New York Jets (1964-70) helping them to a 16-7 win against Baltimore in Super Bowl III. Turner then spent nine seasons with the Denver Broncos (1971-79) and was inducted into their Ring of Fame in 1988. For his NFL career, Turner played in two Super Bowls (III, XII) and two Pro Bowls, and set the NFL record for field goals with 34 in 1968 and 32 in 1969. When he retired, Turner was the second-leading scorer in NFL history.
