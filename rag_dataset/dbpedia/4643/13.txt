Final Fantasy XIII has finally hit North American shores, with raving lunatic fans rushing for game shops across the continent. The title is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis series, which was thought to include only three titles, but with this recent news, it may be seeing more.

The Fabula Nova Crystallis series (as said before) has three titles so far, including Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy Versus XIII, and Final Fantasy Agito XIII. Only one of those titles has been released, but questions have already been asked concerning the future of the Crystallis series.

Game Informer: The currently announced Fabula Nova Crystalis titles are Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy Versus XIII, and Final Fantasy Agito XIII. Do these games represent the entirety of the project?”

Yoshinori Kitase: Please look forward to future announcements.
