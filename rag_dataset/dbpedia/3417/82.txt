Late Thursday night, musical artist Drake released his highly anticipated new single featuring Lil Durk.

In Drake’s video for “Laugh Now Cry Later,” the Canadian hitmaker is joined by a cast of elite athletes at the Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon.

Among the high caliber sports stars in the video, a former Golden State Warrior makes an appearance. Throughout the video, former Warrior turned Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Durant was playing basketball against Drake.

Durant’s highlights against Drake included dunks, jumpers and blocked shots.

Alongside the Texas Longhorns product, Cleveland Browns pass-catcher Odell Beckham Jr., social media influencer Aggy Abby, Oakland native Marshawn Lynch and comedian Druski2Funny appear alongside Drake in the video.

Although Durant is on the court in Drakes video, the former MVP is still recovering from the Achilles injury he suffered in the 2019 NBA Finals. While he’s working back to make his long-awaited Brooklyn debut, Durant’s teammates are busy at Disney World.

On the court, Durant’s Brooklyn Nets capped off their run of seeding round games against Damian Lillard and the Portland Trail Blazers. Caris LeVert led the Nets with 37 points, nine assist and six boards, but it wasn’t enough for the potential Bubble MVP.

Lillard continued his scorching stretch of games with 42 points on 13-of-22 shooting from the field with eight makes coming from beyond the arc. Lillard recorded a double-double with 12 assists. Portland sealed their bid for the playoffs with a 134-133 victory over Brooklyn.

In the first round of the Eastern Conference postseason, Durant’s Nets will match up with Drake’s Raptors.
