Drake has dropped his new single “Laugh Now Cry Later” featuring Lil Durk as a big surprise to fans!

The 33-year-old rapper teased on Thursday (August 13) that he had something coming soon and just hours later, the new song was released.

“Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now / Baby, I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down,” Drake raps in the song.

A music video for the song has already been released and it was shot at Nike headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon. The video includes cameo appearances from athletes such as Odell Beckham Jr., Marshawn Lynch, and Kevin Durant.

The song is the official lead single from Drake‘s upcoming sixth studio album Certified Lover Boy.
