The torch of Yankee stardom passed from Babe Ruth to Lou Gehrig to Joe DiMaggio. He arrived in New York in 1936 as a 21-year-old center fielder. The Yankees won the World Series in his first five seasons in pinstripes, but that was just the beginning of a storied career for “The Yankee Clipper.” DiMaggio played in 13 All-Star Games and won the American L most popular players in baseball history. He was voted into Cooperstown in 1955.
