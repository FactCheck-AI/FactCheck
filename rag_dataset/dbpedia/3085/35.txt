The band "twenty one pilots" was formed back in 2009 in Columbus, Ohio by college friends, Tyler Joseph (lead vocals, ukulele, piano, keytar, synthesizer) and Nick Thomas (bassist). Joseph came up with the band's name while studying "All My Sons" by Arthur Miller; a play about a man who commits suicide after causing the death of twenty one pilots during World War II because he knowingly sent them faulty parts for the good of his business. Joseph explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration for the name of the band. On December 29, 2009, they released their debut, self-titled album and began touring Ohio. In 2011, the drummer and bassist left due to busy schedules and Joseph was joined by a new drummer, Josh Dun.
