Over the course of evolution, Chung Hwa Middle School, BSB has been standing tall and attaining remarkable achievements for almost a century, aided by the capitalisation of the leading-edge technology. It was 87 years ago when our dedicated pioneers first sow the seeds of Chinese education on the land of Brunei and Chung Hwa Middle School, indebted to the wise leadership of His Majesty the Sultan of Brunei in providing a supportive milieu, has sprouted, grown and emerged as a iconic institution that promotes the rich heritage of Tiong Hwa community and preaches the much-treasured Tiong Hwa virtues from generations to generations.

Chung Hwa Middle School was bestowed with beaming pride during the gracious visit of His Majesty Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah who consented to officiate the 80th Anniversary. Now, with the surging needs to keep pace with the latest educational reforms, the school vows to implement the avant-garde SPN 21 curriculum through the optimum utilisation of state-of-the-art facilities and up-to-date software. One noted example is the completion of Pehin Temenggong DatoLim Teck Hoo building in year 2008, considered to embody the schoolâ€™s determination in moulding the future pillars of the society with the best resources available.
