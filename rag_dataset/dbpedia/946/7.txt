Packed with the latest news, achievements, features and interviews, the newspaper is the perfect way to keep up to date with the exciting developments taking place across the University.

Enclosed with this issue you will also find a special 12-page supplement, A University Transformed, which celebrates Northumbria being named University of the Year in the Times Higher Education Awards 2022. This publication follows Northumbria’s journey over the last 15 years and its transformation into a research-intensive university that takes on tomorrow’s challenges to make a positive difference, while at the same time maintaining its clear focus on social mobility. It celebrates the work of our staff, students, and partners – all of whom contributed to the University winning this prestigious award.

In this first issue of 2023, we share exciting plans for Northumbria’s Centre for Health and Social Equity (CHASE) – a brand new, state-of-the-art hub featuring world-class clinical skills facilities, labs, and teaching space, which will be situated within the University’s City Campus.

This edition covers all the latest research news, including a solar scientist using artificial intelligence to predict space storms, a sustainable plastic alternative developed by Northumbria engineers, a life-changing device to support Parkinson’s patients, and work to eradicate the use of torture during police interviews around the world.
