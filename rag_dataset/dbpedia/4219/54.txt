The frontwoman, famous for her outlandish stage outfits, has recorded the character of Teal for the CBeebies show The Adventures Of Abney And Teal.

She said her character, who lives in a hut with just her bed and an umbrella, in the partly hand-drawn show, had opened up a "creative porthole", adding: "I really love her (Teal's) playfulness.

"The way she sings all the time and makes up games, reminds me of myself when I was a little girl."

Upstairs Downstairs actor Adrian Scarborough narrates the new show and is the voice of Abney, who lives below Teal's tree in a hut in the middle of an urban park.

The actor - Mr Pritchard in Upstairs Downstairs - described his character as "a class act" who is a little bit "wacky".
