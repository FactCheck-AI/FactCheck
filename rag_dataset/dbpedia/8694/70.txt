One of the greatest actors of all time and my favorite actor, Gene Hackman is a retired actor and novelist. Gene was born 93 years ago today, January 30, 1930, in California. He is known for his roles in multiple films and won two Academy Awards for his performances in “The French Connection” and “Unforgiven.” He retired from acting in 2004. While I love just about every Hackman film, here are the five that I enjoy most.
