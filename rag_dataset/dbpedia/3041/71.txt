The Advocate

Aka "Hour of the Pig". Lawyer Colin Firth abandons the bustle of 15th century Paris for the supposedly more pastoral pace of rural France, only to get involved in a murder cover-up that culminates in his defending a pig - back when animals actually used to stand trial. Ian Holm, Nicol Williamson and Lysette Anthony co-star.
