Tunisian tart and tantalizingly taut Amina Annabi launched her skin-ternational acting career with a leading role in the French flick Maman (1990). Since then American audiences have been most familiar with amorous Amina in such productions as The Advocate (1993)--Mr. Skin advocates the movie for Amina's exotic skin scenes--and the made-for-TV movie Cleopatra (1999). But it's Amina role in The Sheltering Sky (1990), opposite John Malkovich and Debra Winger, that breast shows off her globe-sized goodies. Debra dazzles with a moist look at her fluffy muff, but Amina very nearly steals the whole movie with her one mamorable scene as a North African prostitute. Malkovich invests his hard-earned cash in a roll in the hay with the hard-nipped, bursting-bosomed babe. Judging from the look on his face, her body is more than worth the price of admission. If you're anything like us, seeing Amina once in any manner of undress is simply not enough to quench your lust. Luckily Annabi seems to have heeded this sentiment and provided another vehicle for masturbation inspiration in the form of movie The Advocate (1993). In this 1/3 B bonanza, Amina plays Samira, and Samira is not afraid of showing her breasts. The first scene shows Amina's chest glands before some idiot gives her something to cover up. Later, Amina is in bed with a lucky guy and we the audience get another look at her big left bazooka. Speaking of bazookas...excuse us while we go make ourselves explode! Annabi has one of those bodies that simply won't quit!
