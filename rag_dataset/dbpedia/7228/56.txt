“Life really is nothing more than a journey back home.”

~Robin Sharma,The Saint,The Surfer and The CEO

I am a huge Robin Sharma fan. I have never seen someone as inspired as he is. I follow him on all social networking sites and have taken some of his online courses. Needless to say, they are awesome. He is awesome. My love and respect for him increased manifold after I read ‘The Saint, The Surfer and The CEO.

The book answers three important questions that we must all ask ourselves at some point in our own lives. The only three questions, the answers to which will matter when we are on our deathbed awaiting to go where we have all come from.

Did I live wisely?

Did I love well?

Did I serve greatly?

I along with Jack on his unusual journey realised that there is so much more to life than we realise, if only we choose to open our eyes and heart to it. It is imperative to do what we love and to do whatever we do with love.
