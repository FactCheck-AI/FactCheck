Born and raised in Toronto, John Tory is the current Mayor of Toronto, first elected in 2014 and re-elected in 2018.

Mayor Tory has worked to build the city up as a global hub for technology and innovation. He has worked to secure billions of dollars in support from the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario for transit expansion, affordable housing and infrastructure investments.

Over the last two years, the Mayor has been leading Toronto’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring that the City government does everything it can to help people get through this emergency. As we’ve made progress fighting the pandemic, the Mayor has also focused on the city’s reopening to help build up the economy and create jobs. He is determined that Toronto will come back stronger than ever.

Under Mayor Tory’s leadership, the City has implemented innovative programs to help residents and businesses safely deal with the challenges of the pandemic.

Throughout the crisis, the Mayor has worked with City Council, the federal and provincial governments, and surrounding municipalities. His commitment to strong partnerships and cooperation has helped deliver billions of dollars in emergency support for Toronto and all municipalities across Canada. This funding has helped increase services responding directly to the pandemic and protected frontline municipal services we know all residents rely on.

A major part of the ongoing response to the pandemic has been the Team Toronto effort underway to deliver COVID-19 vaccine doses to all Toronto residents, including kids ages 5-11. Toronto leads major world cities when it comes to COVID-19 vaccination rates thanks to this effort championed by Mayor Tory.

Mayor Tory is working non-stop to make sure Toronto – the economic engine of Canada – has a strong and robust recovery that creates more jobs and helps residents and businesses in all parts of the city.
