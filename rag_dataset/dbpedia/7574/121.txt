Local nameAndautonia

LocationŠćitarjevo, Croatia

Andautonia was a Roman settlement located on the southern bank of the river Sava, located in the modern-day village of Šćitarjevo, southeast of the city of Zagreb, Croatia.

Andautonia was located in the Roman province of Pannonia, on the Roman road connecting Poetovia and Siscia.According to the 19th-century Croatian archaeologist Šime Ljubić, the toponym Andautonia was mentioned by the ancient geographer Ptolemy in his 2nd-century work Geography, who placed it, perhaps inaccurately, between the settlements of Bononia and Novidunum. The only other mention of the same settlement was found in the Antonine Itinerary, believed to date from the early 3rd century, which refers to the place as Dautonia.The road connected Andautonia with Poetovium via Pyrri and Aquaviva to the north, and Siscia to the south.
