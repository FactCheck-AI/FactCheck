2. “ Infodemiology” the epidemiology of information Describing and analyzing information & communication patterns and its relationship to population health status The science of distribution and determinants of disease in populations Epidemiology Public Health Professionals Policy Makers Public Health Interventions Policy Decisions Population Health Status The notion of “infodemiology” G. Eysenbach. Infodemiology. American Journal of Medicine , 2002;113(0):763-765 Information & Communication patterns

3. The premise “ The Internet has made measurable what was previously immeasurable: The distribution of health information in a population, tracking (in real time) health information trends over time, and identifying gaps between information supply and demand. “ Eysenbach G. Infodemiology. Proc AMIA Fall Symp 2006

8. What is published on the Internet / in public media What is published on the Internet / in public media time Identify emerging disease outbreaks

9. Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) GPHIN monitors global media sources (such as news wires and web sites ), then gathers and disseminates relevant information on such topics as disease outbreaks, infectious diseases, contaminated food and water, bio-terrorism and exposure to chemical and radio-nuclear agents, and natural disasters. It also monitors issues related to the safety of products, drugs and medical devices.

21. What is the correlation between Traditional flu surveillance metrics (per week) ILI: Influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rates (rate per 1.000 visits) Total number of influenza tests performed in testing laboratories Number of positive lab tests (“cases”) Google metrics (searches + ad clicks) Impressions (ad views, correlates with number of flu-related search queries entered) Click-thru-rate Clicks on “do you have the flu?” ad Eysenbach G.

28. Real outbreak or “epidemic of fear”? Public Health response to suspected outbreak Public Health response to surge in information needs Other traditional surveillance data (ED data etc.) Infoveillance Data Even in the absence of any predictive value for outbreaks data can be used: -to improve health communication Learn about population behavior + knowledge Build consumer health vocabulary Real epidemic Epidemic of fear

29. Infovigil project An infoveillance prototype system at the the Centre for Global eHealth Innovation

30. Infovigil - an infoveillance prototype Centre for Global eHealth Innovation, Toronto % Increase Search Activity for Flu-Related Information over last week

32. Technologies involved Concepts of interest (COIs) need to be selected (e.g. influenza) Construct search queries for COIs [multilingual] or : Natural Language Processing (map free text user queries to concepts) IP geolocation software: Longitude, Latitude of searcher Visualization: GIS, GeoBoost Mashup, Google Earth KML: %increase/decrease in searches over time, animated with timeline Spatio-temporal analysis to detect anomalies

34. Accuracy of IP geolocation 98% accuracy on country-level Within-country accuracy: Source: GeoIP, http://www.webcitation.org/5TIPdsZ5m

35. Data sources Search engines

37. Problem: Where to get search data from? (Search engines not forthcoming with data) Gonzales vs Google Inc. Motion to Compel. Jan 18, 2006 http://www.webcitation.org/1142396222389927 The U.S. Department of Justice filed a motion in federal court seeking a court order that would compel search engine company Google, Inc. to turn over “a multi-stage random sample of one million URL’s” from Google’s database, and a computer file with “the text of each search string entered onto Google’s search engine over a one-week period (absent any information identifying the person who entered such query.”
