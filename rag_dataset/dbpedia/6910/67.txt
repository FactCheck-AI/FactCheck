Bernd Eichinger. Everything connected with German film that you‘ve heard about the last 30 years has probably something to do with Bernd Eichinger. He put Constantin Film back on trail. He and Uli Edel started with this incredibly good movie: Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo. He was always part of something great and produced movies like: Die unendliche Geschichte, Der Name der Rose, Der bewegte Mann, Der Schuh des Manitu, Nirgendwo in Afrika, Resident Evil, Der Untergang, Das Parfum, Der Baader Meinhof Kompelx (he also wrote the script of BMH and for many other very good films ) … And he found so many talents and helped them to get started in the film business.I feel honoured I had the chance to know him personally and to share quality time with many memorable moments with "The Bernd". His power and wisdom were amazing. I will always remember him saying: “Jetzt ist Lebenszeit! Ausruhen können wir uns später.“
