A&K Travel Group has acquired the Crystal Cruises brand and two of its ships, Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony.

The travel company is jointly owned by Geoffrey Kent, CEO of luxury travel company Abercrombie & Kent, and Heritage, a holding company chaired by Manfredi Lefebvre d’Ovidio, whose family previously owned the now defunct cruise line Sitmar Cruises.

“I am thrilled to start this new chapter and to be back in an industry that has always had, and always will have a special place in my heart," said d’Ovidio, co-chairman of A&K Travel Group, Crystal Cruises and Abercrombie & Kent. “Therefore, when the opportunity arose to acquire Crystal Cruises, I did not think about it twice.”

Monaco-based V. Ships Leisure will provide ship management services for the two vessels after partnering with A&K Travel Group.

“The idea of combining the unparalleled onboard service that Crystal Cruises is known for with the extraordinary tailor-made experiences Abercrombie & Kent has been successfully providing for our guests for the past 60 years fills me with excitement, enthusiasm and pride," said Kent, who will now become co-chairman of A&K Travel Group and Crystal Cruises.

Crystal Symphony and Crystal Serenity will now resume service in 2023 after undergoing extensive refurbishments.
