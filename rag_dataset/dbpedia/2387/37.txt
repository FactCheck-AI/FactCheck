Grandmother Kainer Passes Painlessly Across the Divide

Wednesday evening, at 8:45 oâclock, Grandmother Annie Kainer answered the summons, and as if drifting into natural sleep, calmly left the scenes of the day and journeyed hence.Â A death that was peaceful, was inspiring; she seemed to realize that her journey to another world was on.Â At the time of her passing her spiritual adviser, Rev. S. A. Zientek, priest in charge of the Sacred Heart Catholic Church, her niece, Miss Annie Kainer of High Hill, and her daughter, Mrs. Louise Heinze were at her bedside; Dr. F. J. Guenther, family physician, was also present.

Mrs. Kainer had been in delicate health for many months, yet in her daily life, she maintained her disposition to carry on, and was the recipient of careful nursing and attention from her daughter, Mrs. Martha Rosenberg and her niece, Miss Kainer.Â For Comfort she never suffered, and although such moments of irritation materialized, and frequency of early memories throttled her vision, she remained the same, kind, âMutterâ Kainer that has characterized her kindness to others in the many years she lived in La Grange.

Death designated its approach as it wills; last Wednesday the day was ideal, real Spring, the mocking bird perched on the trellace near the Rosenberg home and sang lustily; Mrs. Kainer occupied a cozy seat on the porch and for once, with all indications good, her daughter absented herself with her husband from home; before their return the voice of the mother became silent.Â The homecoming, after a few hourâ absence may be surmised, in its touching effect.

Friday morning religious services were held at the home, the body was taken to the Sacred Heart church, mass was held and Rev. Zientek, in calm voice and much affected, paid a worthy tribute to the departed woman.Â Inspiring were his words as he pictured her neighborly life and friendliness to others; not for worldly gain, or prestige, but for the pleasure that it gave her to do something for others.Â Such was the life she had lived, and at a sacrifice to herself.Â The body was buried at the side of her husband who had preceded her in 1907.

Coming to America when a mere child, with her parents, Mrs. Kainer spent her childhood days in Fayette County near to High Hill.Â Here, after she grew to womanhood she was united in marriage with Jos. Kainer, and the union was blessed with nine children.Â The family came to La Grange in 1898, from Schulenburg, and continued to reside here.Â Adolph, a son died in 1899; Jos. The eldest son, died as the result of injuries received in an automobile wreck in 1923.Â One child died in infancy, another at the age of fourteen years.Â The mother bore these afflictions with a fortitude that was to be admired.Â When old age came to her, and the management of her hostelry became too heavy, she discontinued the Kainer Hotel and made her home with daughter, where she continued to live until she passed to her reward.

Mrs. Kainer is survived by the following children: Mrs. Geo (Anna) Mauer of San Francisco, California; Mrs. Alf J. (Louise) Heintze, Mrs. Alex E. (Martha) Von Rosenberg and Edw. Kainer of La Grange, and Chas. Kainer of Beaumont.Â There are seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.Â Mrs. Kainer was 83 years, 7 months and 19 days old when her earthly journey ended.

Inclement as was the weather on the morning of Friday, the friends of the family gathered and p aid their last respects, accompanied the body to the Sacred Heart Church and to the cemetery.Â Weather conditions may have significance, we do not know, but as the thunder roared and the rain fell, the voice of her spiritual adviser came clear and strong, and acquiescence was the more pronounced, to His will.Â It may also be mentioned, in form as reference, that Mrs. Kaiser died shortly after her last, beautiful prayer; at each dayâs close, she uttered the same prayer: âI want to go home.âÂ May it not be said: âHer prayer was heard?â

MR. FRANZ KAINER DEAD.

Died at his home near our city, Wednesday, March 2nd Mr. Franz Kainer, aged 70 years.

Mr. Kainer came to this country about 42 years ago and has resided near Schulenburg about 30 years.

It was not the writer’s good fortune to know him very well but the few times it was our pleasure to meet him we were most favorably impressed by his kind and genial manner and we feel that those who knew him well will sadly miss his kindly smile and friendly greeting; will long in vain to hear the ring of his jovial laughter and to feel again his genial presence.

He was a loving husband, a kind and indulgent father and a good neighbor.

The funeral services were held at the Catholic church Friday morning at 10 o’clock, Rev. Father Mathis officiating. His remains were tenderly consigned to their last resting place in St. Rose’s cemetery. And thus passeth away another old and highly esteemed citizen.

To the surviving wife and eight children, four sons and four daughters the Sticker extends its sincerest sympathy.

MELVIN KALICH

Galveston News, Wednesday, February 3, 1955

HOUSTON, Feb. 2âA 310-pound steel worker was charged with murdering a fellow workman Tuesday after duputy sheriffs halted a hearse carrying the victim's body to burial at Schulenburg.

Held in jail on the murder charge was huge Charles Henry Morrell, 31?, who admitted having an "argument" with the victim and said he hit him during an exchange of blows at work Monday.

Dead was Melvin Kalich, 28, a materials checker at Star Steel Supply Co. He died Monday night at St. Joseph hospital from a fractured skull.

Anton Culak, 34, said he watched terrified as Morrell picked Kalich up bodily when Morrell became enraged, and tossed Kalich to the concrete floor.

A sheriff's office report showed an ambulance was sent to answer a "sick call" at the firm Monday but no further report was made until Tuesday when the victim's brother called for an investigation.

Deputies learned that Kalich's body was en route to Schulenburg for burial and pursued the hearse.

The body was ordered to a Houston funeral home by Justice of the Peace Dave Thompson while he held an inquest. He was expected to order an autopsy.

Brownsville Herald, Friday, July 2, 1956

HOUSTON, July 2âA district court jury, told that the state had failed to prove its murder charge against Charles H. Morrell, deadlocked on whether the man was guilty of aggravated or simple assault late Thursday.

Morrell thus must be tried again on charges he killed Melvin Kalich, 32 [?], by picking him up during a frenzy and hurling him to floor.

Kalich died of a brain concussion about 13 hours after he and Morrell, a husky 300 pounder, had fought at the Star Steel Co., plant where both worked last Feb. 1.

Judge Langston G. King ruled the state had failed to prove its murder charge and said it was up to the jury to decide if Morrell was guilty of aggravated or simple assault. The jury couldn't agree.

DANIEL JOHN KALLUS

Weimar Mercury, Friday, April 2, 1937

Former Weimar Woman's Baby Drowns

From the LaGrange Record we learn of a deplorable accident, in which the 21-month-old son of Mr. and Mrs. Anton Kallus of Rutersville, not very far from LaGrange, was drowned.

The little fellow was named Daniel John Kallus.

The accident occurred Wednesday of last week. The little fellow had accompanied his father to the lot in the afternoon, and soon strayed away. He was missed, but could not be located. Later as the other children of the family returned home from school, it occurred to one of them that little Daniel had been "just crazy" about a fish that was swimming in the water trough at their home. They ran to the spot and there, sure enough, was the little fellow, cold in death.

He had evidently climbed up to the trough, lost his balance, fell in and drowned. Everything humanly possible was done to revive him, but it was of no avail. The funeral took place at the LaGrange Catholic Cemetery Friday morning.

Little Daniel is survived by his parents (the mother being Martha Verunac of this place before marriage), his grandmother, Mrs. Annie Verunac of this city, other grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. T.B. Kallus of Flatonia; two brothers, Eugene and Anton, Jr., and one sister, Evelyn.

Our heartfelt sympathy goes out to his bereaved ones.
