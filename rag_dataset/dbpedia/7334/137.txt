Arizona Christian University Admissions Overview:

Students need to have a minimum GPA of 2.5 in order to be considered for admission to ACU. In addition, test scores form either the SAT or ACT are required--neither test is preferred over the other, and about half of students submit scores from the SAT, and half from the ACT. Since ACU is affiliated with the Christian church, students also need to provide a letter of recommendation from a pastor/adult Christian leader to comment on the applicant's spiritual life. And, as part of the application, students must write two short essays: about their spiritual growth and identity, and why they have chosen to apply to ACU.
