In shadows deep, a lunar outpost lies, Where ruins of the ancient wake and rise. An artifact disturbed, an evil stirs, Unleashing horrors, fertile thoughts in blur. Inseminoid's infestation takes hold, Alien beings, vile and uncontrolled. Their lust for breeding spreads a chilling fear, In violated bodies, life appears.

Trust fractures, alliances start to fray, Survivors grapple with their minds' decay. Visions grotesque, their sanity's demise, As hybrids spawn beneath the astral skies. Time slips away, a race against their fate, Unraveling secrets, but it might be too late.
