"I wrote this piece for the Japan Tour 2007 for the brass quintet of the New York Philharmonic. I tried to draw a picture of music in Manhattan from early morning, the sunrise, at midday and late in the evening when when the city returned to calm ....... then "AIR OF MANHATTAN"!!!!!"

Nicola Ferro

Buonasera is a piece written especially for ALESSI SEMINAR EUROPE with the first performance in Fossano 2008. "It is a particular piece to give a sort of salute to the audience. In Italian, the title means good evening trombone. The piece alternates with a similar introduction and presentation a TV show to come to a central part of contemporary music with references to the resumption of the theme. It is a very attractive piece for the audience and a great opener."
