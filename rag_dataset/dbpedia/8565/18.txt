The Chandrakanta actor is happy being eliminated from the show

Television actor Santosh Shukla has been evicted from Bigg Boss 6 after his one-month long stay in the glass-walled house. He is the second inmate to be out of the show following the surprise eviction of the Bhojpuri film actor Dinesh Lal Yadav aka Nirahua. Earlier, Bigg Boss had given Sapna Bhavnani the power to save whoever she wished to, as the captain of the house. The confrontational hair expert managed to save all the ladies from the nominations this week. And this led to all the men getting nominated.

"I am happy that I am out of the show now because there were few people who were getting on my nerves. I was about to burst but Bigg Boss thankfully called me. I am a very short tempered person but I somehow controlled myself. I depicted my real self in the show," said the 36-year-old tele-star after getting evicted from the show.

Shukla was known for entertaining the inmates with his Bollywood numbers. During his stay in the house, he had started liking co-contestant Aashka Goradia. But soon, he was upset with her and was also seen discussing about Aashka's changing behaviour towards him. "I was very close to Aashka and really liked her. When we were staying in the mud house, she came across as a friendly person. But the moment we entered this house, she changed herself. I came to know from other contestants that she was saying bad things about me. I tried to talk to her but she did not. So I decided I will never speak with her in my life," he added.

Santosh is now planning to take a break from TV and start shooting for his debut film Balwinder Singh Famous Ho Gaya with singers Mika and Shaan.
