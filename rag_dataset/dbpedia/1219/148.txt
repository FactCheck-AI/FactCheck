An accountant by profession, Sir John Anderson built a highly successful career in banking. He helped form the merchant bank Southpac in 1972 and by the time he retired in 2005, he was the CEO of ANZ National Bank. Anderson, who was knighted in 1994, also served as the New Zealand chairman of the World Wide Fund for Nature and was on its international board for four years. He was made chairman of New Zealand Cricket in 1995 and subsequently became his country's representative on the ICC board. Anderson played a key role in restructuring the ICC's internal make-up and rewrote its articles and committee manual. He stepped down from his post in 2008 after 13 years in the position, also relinquishing his role as New Zealand's representative on the ICC board.
