Theobald Brooks Lengyel (born 1970) was the alto-saxophonist of the influential experimental-rock band Mr. Bungle. He is most commonly known as "Theo Lengyel".

Theo first worked with the band on the demo "The Raging Wrath of the Easter Bunny," and later joined as a full-time member. He appears on the band's first two major label albums, Mr. Bungle (1991) and Disco Volante (1995), and also appears - along with several other Mr. Bungle members - as a special guest on the Melt Banana song "Area 877 [Phoenix Mix] ," off of their 1998 album Charlie. According to Mr. Bungle's bassist Trevor Dunn, "we unanimously decided to go on without him because he wasn't growing with the rest of the band and we were running out of things for him to do. He got pissed off and I haven't heard from him since."
