In 1927, King George, announced his sister’s engagement to Prince Christian of Schaumburg-Lippe, a nephew of Christian X of Denmark. However, nothing happened out of that pronouncement. Finally, on July 1, 1939, Irene married Prince Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta (9 March 1900 – 29 January 1948). An only child was born out from this marriage: Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke ofAosta (27 September 1943 – 1 June 2021)

At the height of World War II, Princess Irene threw her service in providing care for the sick and wounded. A trained nurse, she headed a Red Cross hospital train in March 1942 that headed to Russia, where she led a repatriation of wounded Italian soldiers. Despite the difficult journey, Irene returned to Florence the following month. In 1942, Prince Aimone inherited the title of Duke of Aosta after the death of his older brother, Amedeo. On May 18, 1941, he was proclaimed King of the independent state of Croatia, taking the name of Tomislav II. This made Irene queen consort, although the couple never set foot on the territory. Aimone abdicated in 1943.

On the orders of Heinrich Himmler, the Nazis interned Irene and little Amedeo in Austrian concentration camp of Hirschegg, near Graz, together with her sister in-law, Anna d'Orléans and the dowager duchess’ daughters, Margherita and Maria Cristina. They were liberated by the French in May 1945. After they were freed, Irene and Amedeo lived for a few weeks in Switzerland and on July 7, 1945 they returned to Italy, and setteled first in Milan, where she was reunited with her husband. It was the first time for Amedeo to meet his father. They next moved to Naples and finally in Fiesole, near Florence. After the 1946 plebiscite which ended the monarchy in Italy, the family went into exile. Irene and Amedeo fled to Switzerland, while Aimone moved to Buenos Aires in Argentina, where he died of heart attack on 29 January 1948. Amedeo assumed the ducal title and the position as head of the House of Savoy-Aosta.
