The Rail Tram and Bus Union says Adelaide tram drivers have been offered an extra 1 per cent pay rise in enterprise bargaining negotiations.

TransAdelaide's previous pay offer, which was rejected, was for a 12.5 per cent rise over three years.

The revised offer is 13.5 per cent over the same period.

The union says it expects to talk to drivers next week about whether they will support the higher offer.
