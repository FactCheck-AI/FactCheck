There are still millions of machines running Windows Server 2003 that are now left with no general Microsoft support and which may not receive further security updates. Additionally, many compliance requirements include being on a currently supported operating system.

You can leverage the flexibility and reliability of the AWS cloud by migrating your applications to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances running a newer version of Microsoft Windows Server (2008, 2008 R2, 2012 and 2012 R2). Preconfigured Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with different combinations of Windows and SQL Server are available. Amazon EC2 running Windows Server enables you to run any compatible solution on our cost-effective, high-performance, reliable cloud computing platform. Please see the FAQ for more details about Windows Server 2003.
