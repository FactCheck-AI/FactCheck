Key Facts & Information

STATE OF SARAWAK

Sarawak is the largest among the 13 states in Malaysia, with an area nearly equivalent to Peninsular Malaysia. Kuching is Sarawak’s largest city, the state’s economic hub, and the location of the state government. Miri, Sibu, and Bintulu are other significant settlements in Sarawak. Sarawak’s 2022 population was estimated to be 2.97 million.

Sarawak is in the tropical region; therefore, you may expect to find various tropical plants and animals there. Several cave systems can be found within Gunung Mulu National Park.

One of the largest dams in Southeast Asia, Bakun Dam, is located on a tributary of the Rajang River, which is considered the longest river in Malaysia.

Sarawak’s Niah Caves are the site of the world’s oldest human settlement, dating back some 40,000 years.

At the Santubong archaeological site, archaeologists discovered a collection of Chinese ceramics that spanned the 8th to 13th century CE.

The Governor, also known as the Yang di-Pertua Negeri, is the country’s head of state, while the Premier is the country’s head of government. Sarawak, the oldest state in Malaysia, is organized into administrative divisions and districts and is administered by a system that closely resembles the Westminster parliamentary system. Sarawak enjoys more independence than Peninsular Malaysian states do under the Malaysian constitution. Another fact is, Most of the population in Sarawak is Christian.

GOVERNMENT

Sarawak, one of Malaysia’s Borneo states, is governed by the Sarawak Government, which has its headquarters in Kuching.

Sarawak’s state government is founded on and operates following the Federal Constitution of Malaysia and the Constitution of the State of Sarawak, both of which are considered the highest legal authority in Malaysia. There are simply the executive and legislative branches in this state government. Due to Malaysia’s courts being federalized, Sarawak has no independent judicial system.

Symbolizing the ambitious “Land of the Hornbills” soaring to new heights in every endeavor under the wing of the guiding ideology of “politics of development,” the State Crest is a source of national pride. The State Crest is another way that Sarawak stands out.

The Flag of Sarawak has 3 colors and a star in the center.

BLOOD RED: The blood-red flag represents the people’s unyielding will to build a model state and the personal sacrifices they have made along the way.

YELLOW: The yellow color represents the riches of Sarawak’s petroleum, the rule of law, togetherness, and stability amidst diversity. Timber and other natural resources are the basis for the development of her people.

BLACK: The color black represents this prosperity.

STAR: The yellow nine-pointed star represents each of the nine regions where the rakyat lives in peace. The people of Sarawak have made it their mission to better their lot in life, and their aspirations are represented by the Star sign.

ETYMOLOGY

The state’s name is widely believed to have been taken from the Sarawak Malay word Serawak or Cerava, both of which imply “antimony” by Portuguese cartographers in the 16th century.

When Pangeran Muda Hashim handed over Sarawak to the English explorer James Brooke in 1841, he allegedly said the four Malay words “Saya serah pada awak” (I yield it to you).

The latter theory, however, is false, as Sarawak was already the name of the territory before James Brooke’s arrival, and the word awak was not part of the vocabulary of Sarawak Malay before the foundation of Malaysia.

Sarawak is called the “Land of the Hornbills” (Bumi Kenyalang). The Dayak people hold these birds in high regard because they represent divine energy.

A hornbill soaring over a neighborhood is also a sign of good fortune. The Rhinoceros hornbill is the state bird of Sarawak, one of the fifty-four species of hornbills found worldwide.

GEOGRAPHY

Sarawak has two distinct monsoon seasons due to the island’s tropical location and equatorial climate: the northeast and southwest. Miri has the most prolonged daylight hours and the lowest average temperatures of all the main towns in Sarawak. Most of the state only sees the sun for about five or six hours daily.

Sarawak has three distinct ecological regions. Large swaths of swamp and other moist ecosystems dominate the low-lying, flat coastal region. Sarawak is known for its beautiful beaches, such as Kuching’s Pasir Panjang and Damai, Bintulu’s Tanjung Batu, and Miri’s Tanjung Lobang and Hawaii.

Sarawak’s overall land area is close to 124,450 square kilometers, or 37.5% of Malaysia’s total land area. Sarawak is located on the northern coast of Borneo, separated from Kalimantan by the island’s central mountain range. As one travels north, these rise to their maximum point at the steep peaks of Mount Batu Lawi and Mount Mulu, near the headwaters of the Baram River. Sarawak’s highest point is Mount Murud.

Most of the cities and towns are located on hilly terrain, making up much of the inhabited land. Kuching and Sibu are inland, on rivers, while Bintulu and Miri are near the shore, where the hills extend to the West Philippine Sea.

There are thirty national parks, including the World Heritage Site of Gunung Mulu and the caverns of Niah.

The environment in and around the Lambir Hills is also entirely developed. Last but not least is Clearwater Cave, the most comprehensive cave system in Southeast Asia and home to Sarawak Chamber, one of the world’s largest underground chambers, and Deer Cave, the giant cave tunnel.

BIODIVERSITY

Sarawak is home to extensive areas of tropical rainforest and a wide variety of plant species, many of which have been investigated for their potential therapeutic uses.

The mangrove and Nipah forests that border its estuaries account for 2% of the country’s forested land, while the peat swamp forests that run along the remainder of the coast account for 16%, the Kerangas forest accounts for 5%, and the Dipterocarpaceae forests cover most of the country’s mountains.

Bako and Nibong are common in estuary woods, while Ramin, meranti, and medang jongkong are common in peat swamp forests.

There are also a wide variety of animals, including 185 mammal species, 530 bird species, 166 snake species, 104 lizard species, and 113 amphibian species, with 19% of the mammal species, 6% of the bird species, 20% of the snake species, and 32% of the lizard species being endemic. These species tend to congregate in zoos and other types of protected areas.

The government of Sarawak has passed several laws to safeguard the state’s forests and vulnerable animal populations. Orangutans, sea turtles, lemurs, and hornbills all fall under legal protection.

According to the Wild Life Protection Ordinance of 1998, locals of Sarawak are permitted to kill a small number of species of wild animals in the jungles, but they are not allowed to bring home more than 5 kilograms of meat at a time. To ensure the preservation of Sarawak’s flora and fauna, the state government formed the Sarawak Forest Department in 1919.

ECONOMY

During the reign of the preceding three white Rajahs, economic growth in Sarawak slowed to a crawl. Since Malaysia’s establishment, increased petroleum output and rising worldwide petroleum prices have contributed to Sarawak’s higher GDP growth rate. While Malaysia as a whole has a more diversified economy, the economy of this particular state remains highly dependent on the export of primary commodities.

In 2013, 32.8% of Sarawak’s GDP came from primary sectors like mining, agriculture, and forestry, thanks to the state’s rich natural resources. The production of food and drink, rattan and wood goods, primary metals, petrochemicals, cargo, air services, and tourism are also areas of expertise.

Tourism

Sarawak relies heavily on tourism, which accounted for 7.9% of the state’s gross domestic product in 2016. Foreign visitors to Sarawak are primarily from Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany, Australia, Belgium, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.

More than 50,000 people attend the yearly Rainforest World Music Festival, making it the most significant musical event in the area.

The Borneo International Kite Festival, Borneo Music Festival Live, the Borneo Jazz Festival, the Borneo Cultural Festival, and the Anugerah Seri Angkasa are just a few of the other annual events conducted in Sarawak.

The Spring, Boulevard, VivaCity, Plaza Merdeka, and City One are among Kuching’s best malls, while Miri is home to Bintang Megamall, Boulevard, Imperial Mall, and Miri Plaza.

Culture

There is a great deal of linguistic, cultural, and ethnic variety in Sarawak because of the geography and history of the region. Many shifts have occurred among Sarawak’s original inhabitants due to contact with other cultures.

The Iban people of Sarawak, Malaysia, developed a unique culture based on the idea of the warrior and the ability to “take heads” from other groups. The spread of Christianity has profoundly affected the Kelabit and the Lun Bawang, two more indigenous communities in the Sarawak Highlands.

The local church replaced the longhouse as the primary gathering place for community members. Their religious dedication has helped form their perspective outside their hamlet, especially concerning adapting to change.

Several oral traditions exist among the indigenous people of Sarawak, such as the Ngajat dances of the Iban, the Renong and Ensera of the Kayan, and the epic narrative of the Kenyah.

Cuisine

Sarawakian food is one of Malaysia’s distinct regional cuisines. Sarawakian cuisine, like the rest of Malaysian cuisine, centers around rice and other basics. The state’s diverse terrain and indigenous cultures have influenced a wide range of ingredients and food preparations.

Due to its ethnically varied population, Sarawak has a wide range of unique cuisines and cooking techniques. Some of the state’s most famous foods are Sarawak laksa, kolo mee, and ayam pansuh.
