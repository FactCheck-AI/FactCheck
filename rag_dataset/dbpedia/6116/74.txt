Remakes may be the flavour of the day at the moment and I've yet to witness a bad horror film remake and thankfully the 1970 horror cult classic, The Wizard of Gore has received a much needed 21st century makeover.

This slasher movie also features the internet sensations, The Suicide Girls who unfortunately end up being brutally murdered in the film. The main protagonist in the film is Willard (Crispen Glover) who plays a mysterious illusionist with a shady past as his history.

His selling point is performing hideous mutilations on beautiful girls and through his magic, they reappear again, unharmed. Unfortunately when the girls start turning up dead, one fan, a journalist named Edmund Bigelow (Kip Pardue) is fascinated by Willard and decides to perform some investigations for himself, only to find himself in some hot water with some strange theories.

Needless to say with an MA15+ rating, The Wizard of Gore is quite bloody as he butches his beautiful semi-naked co-stars one by one. Of course, the obsession of Bigelow starts to grow unhealthy that leads to the twist of the story and if you have not seen the original, you may be either shocked or groaning in pain when the end finally comes.
