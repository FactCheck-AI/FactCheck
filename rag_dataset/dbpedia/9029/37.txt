Maya the Bee is not just an animated series, it’s a brand. Several generations have grown up with this loveable character and now a new 3D production has been backed by Europe’s major broadcasters.

Maya is a little bee like no other. Non-conformist and thirsty for adventure, she left the hive to live in the meadow, free like a… bee. The world is just too big and too fascinating to remain confined to the restricted life of the hive.
