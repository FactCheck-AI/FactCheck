The anterior tibial artery is a terminal branch of the popliteal artery that supplies the anterior compartment of the leg. It originates below the popliteus muscle and courses vertically down the leg between muscle compartments before becoming the dorsalis pedis artery. It gives off branches that anastomose around the knee and ankle joints. The posterior tibial artery is the larger terminal branch of the popliteal artery, supplying the posterior and lateral leg compartments and sole of the foot. It travels behind the tibia and fibula, giving muscular and nutrient branches before terminating as the medial and lateral plantar arteries. Throughout its course it is accompanied by the tibial nerve.
