Abstract

This thesis examines the integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 with hydraulic modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance flood risk management in Ljungby Municipality, Sweden. The study focuses on the February 2020 flood event, utilizing advanced remote sensing technologies to improve flood extent mapping and disaster response. Quantitative data for this research were derived from SAR data, high-resolution images from Sentinel-2, and daily coverage from PlanetScope satellites. These data sources were complemented by GIS layers depicting local geography and infrastructure, alongside meteorological data from local weather stations. Qualitative insights were gained through field visits,... (More)

This thesis examines the integration of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 with hydraulic modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to enhance flood risk management in Ljungby Municipality, Sweden. The study focuses on the February 2020 flood event, utilizing advanced remote sensing technologies to improve flood extent mapping and disaster response. Quantitative data for this research were derived from SAR data, high-resolution images from Sentinel-2, and daily coverage from PlanetScope satellites. These data sources were complemented by GIS layers depicting local geography and infrastructure, alongside meteorological data from local weather stations. Qualitative insights were gained through field visits, stakeholder questionnaires, and policy document reviews. The integration of SAR data with hydraulic models and GIS proved crucial in capturing real-time flood extents, overcoming common observational challenges such as cloud cover. This approach significantly improved the accuracy of flood risk assessments and supported the development of effective flood response strategies. Findings suggest that SAR data enhances the predictive accuracy and operational effectiveness of flood risk management, facilitating better preparedness and informed decision-making. The study concludes that leveraging SAR data in conjunction with traditional flood management practices offers a more dynamic and precise tool for understanding flood dynamics and managing urban flood risks. It recommends wider adoption of these technologies in municipal planning to improve disaster preparedness and community resilience. (Less)

Popular Abstract

Floods are among the most devastating natural disasters, and managing their risks is crucial to protect communities. This study focuses on improving flood risk management in Ljungby Municipality, Sweden, by integrating advanced technologies. Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1, high-resolution images from Sentinel-2, and daily satellite coverage from PlanetScope, the research mapped the February 2020 flood accurately, even in cloudy conditions.

The integration of SAR data with hydraulic modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provided a clear picture of the flood extent. This approach significantly improved the accuracy of flood risk assessments and supported effective flood response strategies. The... (More)
