Original Miramax Films One Sheet Poster (27x41) for the James Foley family drama, TWO BITS (1995) starring Jerry Barone, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, and Al Pacino. Set in South Philadelphia in 1933, 12-year old Gennaro (Barone) lives with his widowed mother (Mastrantonio) and his ailing grandfather (Pacino). This bittersweet film is a wonderful look at the relationship between a boy and his grandfather in the depression era. There are no special effects, car chases or explosions; rather, the film takes you on a sad but very personal emotional journey. This original one sheet poster is rolled and in very fine condition.
