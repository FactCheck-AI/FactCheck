Join us for another cult classic FAN SELECTION FRIDAY, this time with Dobbs Ferry’s own Terrapin Rose, on September 6th at 8pm, where we’ll get our last blast of Summer with her selection of Back to the Beach (1987/PG/92 min/Comedy, Musical)!

summary: Life’s a beach when Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, having grown up and put aside their beach-partying lifestyle, visit their daughter (Connie Stevens) in Southern California with their punk rock son (Tommy Hinkley) and discover there’s still some wild times left in them.

Stay after the movie for our always lively Film Discussion where we’ll share trivia and have fun prizes!
