Here are some amazing photos to get you in the winter spirit. They're images of giant snow "crop circles" created by artist Simon Beck, who makes them at the Les Arcs ski resort in France by meticulously trampling out geometric patterns with his snow shoes.

The snowy creations can take the 54-year-old Beck (right) between six hours and two days to complete. Beck, who's based in England but resides at Les Arcs in the winter, uses an orienteering compass and measuring tape to lay out the design. He then ties a clothes line to a central anchor and painstakingly trudges out the spectacular shapes.
