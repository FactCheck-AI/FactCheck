Print high quality, full colour labels with up to 127 mm (5″) width.

Perfect short-run label printer

Primera’s LX600e is a compact and lightweight desktop colour label printer with a maximum print width of 127 mm (5″) and a print speed of up to 114 mm (4.5″) per second, which is the best-in-class throughput. Printed labels can include photos, graphics, illustrations, and text – even high-resolution or two-dimensional barcodes. Print labels when and where you need them in just the quantities you can actually use.

Best Print Quality

LX600e produces gorgeous, professional- quality labels with colour inkjet printing at up to 4800 dpi.

Horizontal banding is a common problem with many lower-cost desktop colour label printers. Not so on LX600e. Banding is virtually eliminated – even on the fastest print speeds.
