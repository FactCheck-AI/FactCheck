"To get an interview this big, you have to be bold." Netflix has revealed the first look teaser trailer for a film titled Scoop, a behind-the-scenes account of Prince Andrew's infamous Newsnight interview. This is set to premiere on Netflix worldwide in early April for everyone to watch. The film is a tribute to the tenacity and bravery of journalists, showing how far they're willing to go to get a major scoop. It tells the story of how the BBC obtained the bombshell interview with Prince Andrew about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The interview aired in 2019 just a few years ago - you can watch a BBC video about it here. Gillian Anderson (as Emily Maitlis), Keeley Hawes (as Amanda Thirsk), Billie Piper (as McAlister), and Rufus Sewell (as Prince Andrew) star in Scoop, which is directed by Philip Martin, who has been directing episodes of "The Crown", "Catherine the Great", & "Night Sky" most recently. Stay tuned for more.
