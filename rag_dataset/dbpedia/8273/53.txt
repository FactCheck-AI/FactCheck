Another comic murder mystery from director Woody Allen, Scoop involves a string of conceits, blunders, and narrow escapes. Like Allen’s prior film Match Point, Scoop is set in London and stars Allen as magician The Great Splendini and Scarlett Johansson as an American journalism student on the trail of a serial killer. Allen, himself, plays a bumbling magician responsible for the setup of the ludicrous plot to follow. Instructor Paul Marino will introduce the film, raise questions to ponder and host a post-viewing discussion. Sponsored by Chases on the Beach – Where It’s Always Sunny.
