Released in 1979, Manhattan endures as Woody Allen's love letter to the Big Apple. Allen clearly goes all out, beginning the film with an uplifting narration of the city, photographing it spectacularly and painting the final results with a rich George Gershwin score.

This is Woody Allen fueled by his growing success in the 1970's, who still received carte blanche backing from the investors who had the success of Annie Hall fresh on their minds. Teaming up again with Diane Keaton, as well as Michael Murphy, who seems during this period of time is doing nothing but cheating on his wife (An Unmarried Woman), fans are treated to an ensemble set of focused unforgettable performances that appear to happen as effortlessly as walking.

Mariel Hemingway's portrayal of the 18 year-old Tracy is sweet, and her nominations for an Oscar and a Bafta for Best Supporting Actress were well deserved. She may not have been in a finer film, however I still enjoy watching her in the tragic life of Dorothy Stratton in Star 80.
