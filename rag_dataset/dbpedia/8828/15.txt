Le Parisien reported that Woody Allen's next film will be titled Caf√© Society , and is anticipated to be making its world premiere in May at the Cannes Film Festival.

Bruce Willis was originally scheduled to star, but last fall it was announced that conflicting schedules forced Willis to choose between two tantalizing career opportunities: his Broadway debut in Stephen King's Misery or his first starring role in an Allen film. He chose Broadway.

Comic actor Steve Carrell was tapped to replace Willis in the movie, which will also feature Kristen Stewart, Stephen Kunken, Jesse Eisenberg, Blake Lively, Parker Posey, Jeannie Berlin, Corey Stoll, Ken Stott, Anna Camp, Sari Lennick and Paul Schneider.

Shooting took place in New York and Los Angeles. The title is also the name of a Manhattan nightclub that was trendy in the 1930s, the time period of the film.
