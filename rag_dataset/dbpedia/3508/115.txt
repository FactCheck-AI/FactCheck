QUEER GREEN PLACE; Sex-fuelled lesbian TV show shot in Glasgow.

Byline: Rick Fulton

GLASGOW becomes a hotbed of lesbian lust in a sex-fuelled drama starring Scots actress Laura Fraser and Hollyoaks babe Roxanne McKee.

Sexy Laura, The Tudors star Ruta Gedmintas and Fiona Button, who appeared in The Palace, play three 20-something lesbians living in the city in new series Lip Service.

The six-part BBC show started filming last week.

An insider said: "There is a lot of lesbian sex. It's going to put Glasgow on the gay map."

Ruta, who romped and bared her boobs as Elizabeth Blount in The Tudors, plays bed-hopping photographer Frankie.

Laura, star of Nina's Heavenly Delights, which was also set in Glasgow, plays Frankie's former lover Cat, who may not be as immune to her ex's charms as she claims to be.

Fiona takes on the role of Tess, Cat's pal and flatmate who tends to attract the wrong type of women.

Roxanne and Emmerdale star Heather Peace also join the female line-up of the show, which will be screened next spring.

Anne Mensah, head of drama at BBC Scotland, added: "The series takes a vivid and authentic look at the lives and loves of modern British gay women."
