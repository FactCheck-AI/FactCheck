Lip Service, the sexy series about a group of Glaswegian lesbians, returns to BBC Three April 20, and there’s a smoking hot new teaser out for your viewing pleasure.

Mistresses’ scribe Harriet Braun penned the L Word-esque series that stars Nina’s Heavenly Delights’ Laura Fraser as Cat the architect; hot blonde and Spooks’ star Ruta Gedmintas as Cat’s ex Frankie, a photographer with shades of Shane; Coronation Street’s Heather Peace as a police sergeant with the gender neutral moniker Sam, The Palace’s Fiona Button as Tess and Hollyoaks' Roxanne McKee as Lou – more gender neutral naming – a closeted daytime television star.

Look for new characters this time around including Neve McIntosh (Bodies) as magazine editor Lauren, Sinead Keenan (Being Human) as Nora, an actor who tangles with Tess, and Anna Skellern as hot Aussie doc Lexy.

Here’s the teaser for the second series:
