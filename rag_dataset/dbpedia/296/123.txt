This is a chronological list of live pay-per-view events promoted by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). This list only includes the three-hour, live professional wrestling events held on Sundays that were built up to by TNA, predominantly with its weekly television program Impact Wrestling. TNA first began producing these events in 2004 and held them monthly until January 2013 , when they switched to a schedule with four events per year. Initially, all events were held at the Impact Wrestling Zone, later changed to have several events a year being held elsewhere, The major and most heavily promoted events are TNA Lockdown, TNA Slammiversary, and TNA Bound for Glory. These events are also a major revenue source for the promotion.

From its inception, TNA's only television programming was a two-hour weekly show shown on pay-per-view. The first one was held on June 19, 2002 in Huntsville, AL. The last of these shows aired on September 8, 2004. TNA began airing their television program TNA Impact! now called Impact Wrestling (which premiered June 4, 2004) as its primary program. After Impact! began, TNA felt that they had a fanbase that would support monthly, live, three-hour pay-per-view events. On November 7, 2004, TNA aired the first of these events, Victory Road. These events were produced monthly since and the event of each month was given a different name. Several changes and switches were made to the event names throughout the years.

TNA also held some pay-per-view events in co-operative with Japan and Mexico promotions from 2007-2009 and 2011. Those promotions were Inoki Genome Federation (IGF), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA).

The monthly event schedule was changed in January 2013, with all but four events cancelled. In their places, TNA began producing TNA One Night Only, taped television specials also offered on pay-per-view.
