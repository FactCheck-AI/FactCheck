The Detroit Lions have added more experience to a revamped, younger offensive line with the signing of veteran guard/center Leroy Harris.

Harris, who is coming off knee surgery, spent the last six seasons with the Tennessee Titans. He was a fourth-round draft pick in 2007 coming out of North Carolina State, and played in 75 games, including 42 starts, for the Titans.

Harris, who turns 29 later this week, could be in the mix at right guard, where the Lions must replace starter Stephen Peterman. The top candidates for that job are third-round draft pick Larry Warford, and returning players Dylan Gandy and Rodney Austin.
