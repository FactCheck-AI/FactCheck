Free agent guard/center Leroy Harris and the Detroit Lions have agreed to terms, according to Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press. Harris has spent the last six seasons with the Tennessee Titans. He should upgrade a Lions offensive line that struggled to open holes in the running game last season.

Harris worked out with the Lions last week, along with Winston Justice. Harris started eight games for the Titans last season before tearing his ACL. How he recovers from a serious injury remains to be seen, but if healthy there is plenty of reason to expect Harris to compete for a starting job in Detroit. He helped pave the way for a running game in Tennesse that had fits of success behind Chris Johnson.

The Lions' running game needs a boost after finishing 23rd in the NFL in yardage. The Lions signed Reggie Bush in the offseason, and are hoping that Mikel Leshoure can reach his potential and form the other half of a potent tandem. The team also drafted Kentucky offensive guard Larry Warford in the third round of the 2013 NFL Draft in hopes that he can form one of the walls in the interior of the offensive line.
