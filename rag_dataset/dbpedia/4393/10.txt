SHADE EMPIRE - SINTHETIC - MAGICK

This is typically terrible Finnish pop rock cloaked in the mantle of distorted guitar and croaked vocals. Aside from the ridiculous band name which might be due to an erroneous understanding of the meanings for the words 'shade' and 'shadow' (I am the emperor of cool shades!?), the Classical and dance influences drench any and all credibility out of the band's debut full-length. This is sinful in its surrender to weak trends and synthetic if labeled metal. One can see how fans of Cradle Of Bodom might cozy up to this stuff, but which metal fan would want to suffer this? Shade Empire is the musical answer to the stink bomb. - Ali "The Metallian"

SHADE EMPIRE - INTOXICATE O.S. - DYNAMIC ARTS

The only ”˜intoxication’ going on here is someone somewhere believing with a straight face that this Shade Empire is a heavy metal band. Oh sure, one will read online reviewers accord this their usual 8/10 or whatever, but those reviewers are eight-years-old mentally. The bigger commercial rags rely on brownnosing for advertisements and will do their duty so never mind them either. Shade Empire is as Mickey Mouse as Cradle Of Filth, as predictably weak as Graveworm and as stupid, lost as Zyklon and as wimpy as a country that bombs a poor nation from the air and calls it a war. Pop, electronic, goth, Disney, joke, weak maybe. Heavy, metal, electric or significant no way. - Ali “The Metallian”

SHADE EMPIRE - ZERO NEXUS - DYNAMIC ARTS

The ignorant have an excuse. They don’t know. Those who know, yet fail to heed the signs, take actions or steer correctly are a different story. They are the guilty ones.

There is no doubt that Shade Empire knows what a real metal beat is. The opening moments of the album - the song is called 9 in 1 - thrashes hard before the band makes its real intentions known. The album even features some blast beats. Effective pieces like these are not complete exceptions on the album. That is why the complete and utter Finnish tomfoolery singes even more than usual. Keyboards, female vocals, a saxophone or whatever all come and go in a bout of nihilistic self-aggrandizement. It is undeniable that Dimmu Borgir has made a career out of Mickey Mouse metal, but other successes in the sub-genre of betrayal and stupidity are scarce. So try as it might, Shade Empire’s commercial appeal mixed with extreme brevity have and will fall apart. This is where the heavy riffs, the fast picking, the brilliant sound and the rest of is as wasted as a late night drunken collapse next to the girl of one’s dream. All potential, no action. - Ali “The Metallian”
