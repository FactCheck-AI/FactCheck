ICBC respectfully acknowledges that we are privileged to live and work on the traditional and ancestral homelands, both unceded and treatied, of Indigenous Peoples and Nations across British Columbia, each with their own unique traditions, histories and cultures.

We're committed to learning how to better partner with Indigenous communities to further reconciliation. We support employees on their individual paths towards reconciliation and encourage expressions of Indigenous culture at the workplace. We recognize that we are early in our reconciliation journey and will provide more information on the actions we're taking as we progress.
