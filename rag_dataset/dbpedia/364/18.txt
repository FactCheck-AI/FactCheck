If the knowledge test is not available in your native language you may use an interpreter obtained by the Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC) via state contract.

Deaf or hard of hearing options

If you are deaf or hard of hearing, you can take the knowledge test with an MVC-approved interpreter.

In order to qualify, the interpreter must be one of the following:

Certified by the National Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf and listed with the New Jersey Division of the Deaf.

Evaluated by the Division of the Deaf and on the approved list of that division’s interpreters.
