The opening prologue of the “The Clash of the Titans” describes how the world was divided between Zeus, Hades and Poseidon, but the latter god is just barely visible in the finished film. Poseidon is played by Danny Huston, who hasn’t a single line of dialogue and merely nods at Mount Olympus confabs where Zeus and Poseidon — Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes, a long way from “Schinder’s List” — argue over the fate of mankind. Though most of his work apparently ended up on the cutting room floor, Huston was a good enough sport to show up for the film’s L.A. premiere last night. Or maybe he’s hoping for a bigger role in the sequel. Though quite a bit was written about Huston’s casting in the film, I couldn’t find a single image of him in costume. This one is of Kevin McKidd, who played Poseidon in this year’s other riff on Greek mythology, “Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief.”
