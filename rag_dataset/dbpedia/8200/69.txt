Packaging plays a critical role in the protection of drug and pharmaceutical products from damage and contamination. Pharmaceutical packaging companies supply the pharmaceutical industry with a range of packaging materials to preserve the integrity of their products.

The choice of materials used in pharmaceutical packaging depends on the type of drug or pharmaceutical product being packaged. Pharmaceutical companies need to consider factors such as the degree of required protection, the dosage, convenience of use and cost of packaging.
