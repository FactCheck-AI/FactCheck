Legendary British actor Michael Caine is Jack Carter, the London gangland enforcer who returns to his hometown of Newcastle to avenge his brother’s untimely death. Rarely has the criminal underworld been so realistically portrayed than in this 1971 masterpiece.

Director Mike Hodges also wrote the screenplay, based on the novel ‘Jack’s Return Home’ (1970) by Ted Lewis. Co-starring alongside Michael Caine are Ian Hendry, the writer John Osborne and Britt Ekland. The film’s distinctive theme tune is by Roy Budd, a jazz pianist and composer, who composed most of the soundtrack.

Shot on location, resulting in a devastatingly authentic snapshot of life in the north east of England in the late-industrial period, Get Carter remains arguably the grittiest and greatest of all British crime films.

Utilising the original 35mm camera negative, the new restoration has been approved by Mike Hodges himself. Get Carter has never looked better on screen.
