Lida Baarova born on September 7, 1914 as Ludmila Babková in Prague, was a Czech actress and singer. After training at the Prague Acting Conservatory, Lida Baarova made her first film at the age of 17.

In 1934 she was hired by UFA, learned German and shot Barcarole in 1935. The male lead in this production was played by the married German actor Gustav Fröhlich, with whom Baarova was henceforth in a relationship. In 1938, Lida Baarova won the "German Film Award in Gold" for her role in "Barcarole".

After Joseph Goebbels sought her out at Gustav Fröhlich's house, she became the Reich propaganda minister's secret mistress. The scandalous relationship was also discussed publicly. Her family had been persecuted because of her association with Goebbels. Her mother had died of a heart attack while being interrogated by communists. Unable to face the contempt of her colleagues, her sister had jumped out of a window and committed suicide.

After World War II, Lida was jailed for eighteen months at the Prague prison. After February of 1948 and release from prison, she married Jan Kopecky and left for Austria.

Since 1948 Lida Baarová lived in Salzburg.

Lída Baarová was born in Prague in 1914 with the name Ludmila Babková. Her mother sang in choirs and pushed both Baarová and her younger sister, Zorka, into show business. Right after enrolling in the Prague Conservatory at the age of 17, Baarová landed her first film role.

With her natural-born vivacity and charm, she was soon making a name for herself in romantic comedies and operettas. In her early Czech films, she is seen turning a somersault in bed, swimming in the nude, and clambering on top of a cabinet to warble a comedic song.

At the age of 20, with 16 films under her belt, she was on her way to star in Barcarole at UFA, the top film studio in Berlin.

In Germany’s Weimar years, Berlin was not only the capital of the Republic, but also the filmmaking capital of Europe, led by innovative directors like Fritz Lang, G.W. Pabst, and Josef von Sternberg. But when the Nazis seized power in 1933, everything changed.

At that time, Joseph Goebbels was appointed Minister of Propaganda, with total control over the news, radio, public rallies, and all the arts. He immediately barred all Jewish filmmakers, which prompted an exodus of much of Berlin’s top talent. Under Goebbels’ direction, UFA began churning out a dizzying mix of Nazi propaganda and lighthearted distractions.

In the year that Hitler was named Führer, Baarová was on a Babelsberg film set, shooting Barcarole on a fabricated Venetian canal. Her co-star was marquee idol Gustav Fröhlich, who had starred in Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. Fröhlich was married to Gitta Alpár, a Jewish Hungarian operetta star, who had fled Berlin with their daughter a few months prior to his casting opposite Lída Baarová. He was supposed to join his family in London. Instead, he and Baarová began an affair.

They moved in together and summered on idyllic Schwanenwerder, an island near Lake Wannsee. The wealthy Jewish property owners had been driven off the island and it had become a playground for prominent Nazis.

Three doors down from the adulterous couple, Goebbels and his family had taken over a villa formerly owned by a Jewish banker — and that’s where the Nazi Minister of Propaganda crossed paths with the rising German starlet. During the summer of 1936, Goebbels began wooing Baarová.
