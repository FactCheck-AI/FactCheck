(10 May 1871)

An agreement that ended the Franco-Prussian War. By it France surrendered Strasburg, Alsace and part of Lorraine, together with the great fortresses of Metz to Bismarck's Germany. An indemnity of five billion gold francs was imposed by Germany on France, and a German army of occupation was to remain until the indemnity had been paid. Bismarck's aim in this treaty was to ensure that France would be entirely cut off from the Rhine.
