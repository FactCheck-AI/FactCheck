I've been looking at numerous websites and videos for building digital

tv antennas. I live in the country and am a long distance from all

stations. (most are at least 50 miles). The plans for the antenna are

mostly for a single, double, or 4 pole bow tie. But they all have

different whisker lengths which is for different stations (vhf, lower

uhf, middle uhf, and high uhf). They have referred to an online chart

that shows the stations frequencies and the length of these whiskers

that are most suitable for that frequency. i'm not finding such a

chart.

I'm mostly looking to improve the upper VHF, channels 8 thru 10

(actual). I have one of those small RCA amplified antennas that are

meant to mount on a wall or on a mast. I have mine on a mast, made from

several lengths of 1-1/4" EMT conduit. It sits about 5 feet above the

highest part of my roof. I'm getting a good signal for stations located

between 15 to 50 (actual), but those other ones I mentioned above dont

come in very good, or not at all.

I just want to play around with some ofthese bow tie antennas made from

scrap wire and stuff, but so far, I only know that the whiskers need to

be longer for the low uhf and upper vhf channels. I'd like to make one

that is suitable for top gain for those channels 8 thru 10 (actual).

Thanks for all help.

The first thing you need to do is find out the frequencies of the stations that you want to receive. When the conversion to digital signals occurred, they tried to make it easy for the masses. So stations that say were on channel 8 still show up as channel 8, but in actual practice the station moved to say channel 34. So you want to find the actual frequencies.

Second the bow tie antennas are generally for uhf and not for vhf.

There are several web sites that will show the direction from your house to the tv stations and the virtual and actual frequency that the station transmits. So google for tv location and frequency. When you can say exactly what frequency you are trying to receive, then we can be of more help.

I only used the word ACTUAL at least three times in my posting. There

was a reason for that! I charted the whole thing on tvfool.com.

I also know the exact direction of the station from that website in

degrees from compass points.

ONCE AGAIN

They ARE the >>>===--- ACTUAL---===<<<< channel frequencies in use.

Channel 8 /IS/ on the channel 8 frequency.

This is not the case for all the channels around here though.

Lets begin with channel 8.

According to

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_television_frequencies

Ch 8 is 180 to 186mhz. Video and sound are different. I'm not sure

which to use. But that site has them all listed.

Therefore if i want to pickup ACTUAL ch 8 thru 10, I'm looking at 180

thru 198mhz.

Oops! The channel numbers haven't changed, but the frequencies

were heavily reallocated when the digital conversion began; it's a real

problem trying to find those frequencies from the channel number (I've tried)

and there have been (in Seattle at least) a half dozen frequency changes

announced by my Tivo (along with instructions to re-scan so the receiver

doesn't miss channels).

Bingo! Maybe, if you seek in the menus of antenna-connected TVs and converters, one

will give out this info, in an up-to-date fashion. Which might change next month.

I tried FCC and local station's websites, and was unable to locate that information

in those places. <antennaweb.org> used to be a good place to start.

www.rabbitears.info seems like a good place to start looking today.

It looks as if they're actually pulling data from an FCC database.

Try the "TV Query" feature, and ask for a detailed listing on all

stations in a given market and city... LOTS of information there,

including the transmitter location, power, antenna height, gain, and

directional pattern!

From what I recall, the usual reason for this would be that there was

no UHF frequency to which they would be moved, and which would have

allowed them to retain their current customer-footprint coverage,

which would not have caused interference problems of one sort or

another for other stations in the area.

This sort of situation cropped up a fair bit in some of the more

crowded metro areas (especially on the east coast) where each large

city had a large number of stations. "Packing" all of the stations

into the available UHF channels wasn't a trivial challenge, since some

stations were moving up from VHF, and some had to move down from the

higher-frequency UHF channels which were being reclaimed from TV

allocation and transferred to public-service allocation.

Okay the speed of light and radio waves is 300,000,000 meters / second.

So if you divide that by 180,000,000 You get the wave length is 1.667 meters.

Multiply that by 39.37 inches / meter and you have the wave length is 65.62 inches. The speed of a radio wave is slower in a conductor than in a vacuum, so multiply the 65.62 by .95 and get 62.34 inches. And a half wave length is 31.17 inches. So that is the number you want for the horizontal length of each section of the antenna.

If I have screwed anything up, somebody please correct me. I have not screwed arounud with antenna's for a long time.

** Not true.

The speed of a EM wave is slower in a * medium* like plastic insulation.

> so multiply the 65.62 by .95 and get 62.34 inches.

** Accounts for the "end effect" that makes all antennas seem a little

longer then the elements .

But a "bow tie" antenna is a odd ball with a larger effect that a straight

element.

** But each arm of the "bow tie" is only half that.

The OP should try using arms of about 12 inches.

OR much better BUY a real antenna ( Yagi or log periodic) cut for the bands

he need and with high gain..

The only wideband antenna for your application is a log periodic. The ARRL

handbook has the designs. Unless you are good with welding, this isn't

trivial. The ones I've built were done with threaded Al rods, which means

you need to use a tap and die. [There are tricks to do the Al to Cu

interface.] You do this kind of work for antennas you can't buy, i.e. for

SIGINT. For TV, you buy the damn antenna. It is cheaper.

Now if you want to build an antenna for ONE channel, it will have to be a

folded dipole due to the TV bandwidth. The folded dipole is the driven

element. You need at least one reflector and one director. These are not too

difficult to make if you use brass rods and a wooden boom.

The deal is unless you know what you are doing, these outdoor antennas will

degrade faster than commercially made antennas. It is a waste of time.

If you really insist on this project, look at this website:

http://www.george-smart.co.uk/wiki/432MHz_Yagi

The site is kind of slow. I found it by doing an image search because 90% of

the designs on the internet are wrong. This is the right approach, though I

haven't checked his math. The driven element is a folded dipole for

bandwidth. The loop balun works well. The boom has to be wood. Metal boom

design changes the math a bit, and the modeling programs like NEC do not

work well with metal booms, so most yagi designs on the internet with metal

booms are fiction.

I have one of these scaled for the federal 400MHz band and it is awesome.

[Like I said, you go through this nonsense for things you can't buy.]

Indeed. Unless he has stations in several different directions the best

solution by far for marginal reception is a high gain directional aerial

high up and pointed at the transmitter. Yagi or log periodic depending

on the needed bandwidth. A masthead amplifier might help too.

You can make your own DIY yagi/log periodic but it is hard work.

UK has suffered some silly problems after digital switchover because the

Welsh stations are now powerful enough and omnidirectional transmitting

that they appear in a sidelobe of many high gain antennas in Manchester

(a major city). Certain manufacturers older sets like Panasonic are

stupid enough to place the first station found in the prime position

when they retune. The result is that because the lower frequency Welsh

stations are found first they occupy the main slots!

(this is really unhelpful as hardly anyone in Manchester speaks Welsh)

The approved fix is to unplug the aerial connector until the low

channels have been scanned! Telemenders charge good money for this!!
