Nelly Adamson Landry (December 28, 1916 – February 22, 2010[1]) was a female tennis player from Belgium (became French citizen after marriage). She was the 1948 women's singles champion at the French Championships beating Shirley Fry. She had also been a finalist in 1938, losing to Simone Mathieu, and reached again the final in 1949, losing to Margaret Osborne duPont.

According to John Olliff of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Landry was ranked in the world top ten in 1946 and 1948 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 7 in those rankings in 1946.[2]

On January 16, 1934, Adamson (not yet Landry) married American author and emigre Tod Robbins at the town hall in Villefranche on the French Riviera. Robbins was an expert amateur athlete. Together, he and Adamson became a formidable doubles team. Adamson was Robbins's fourth wife, and they remained married through World War II and Robbins's long imprisonment in a German concentration camp. After the war, Adamson stayed with Robbins until his death, remarrying afterward.[3] Nelly Adamson married Pierre Landry and lastly Marcel Renault, both former French tennis players.
