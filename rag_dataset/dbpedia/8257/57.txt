Introduction

• West Ham United host Stoke City in the Carling Cup fourth round, aiming to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since the 2007/08 season.

• The Hammers reached the last 16 by defeating League Two new boys Oxford United 1-0 at home and fellow Barclays Premier League side Sunderland 2-1 away from home.

• Stoke have been at home in each of their opening two Carling Cup ties this season, defeating League Two outfit Shrewsbury Town 2-1 before overcoming Premier League Fulham in the third round.

• West Ham picked up their first Premier League point of the season at Stoke on Saturday 18 September. Scott Parker netted a first-half opener at the Britannia Stadium before Kenwyne Jones headed in an equaliser after the break.

• West Ham and Stoke have met three times previously in the League Cup. The first meeting, in the 1971/72 semi-finals, saw the Potters prevail 3-2 in a second replay at Old Trafford. In 1982/83, the Hammers won 3-2 on aggregate in the second round before prevailing 5-1 on aggregate at the same stage in 1990/91.

• West Ham manager Avram Grant guided Portsmouth to a 4-0 Carling Cup fourth-round victory over Stoke last season. Frederic Piquionne scored twice in that tie at Fratton Park.

Wednesday's team news

West Ham United

• Right-back Lars Jacobsen will definitely miss Wednesday's game as he is cup-tied. Jacobsen featured for Blackburn Rovers in their second-round victory over Norwich City in August. Julien Faubert could deputise as his three-match ban for a reserves red card does not start until Birmingham away on 6 November.

• Captain and centre-back Matthew Upson is likely to miss the tie after picking up a minor hamstring injury in Saturday's 2-1 Premier League defeat by Newcastle United.

• Forward Frederic Piquionne is struggling to be fit after suffering a knock during the second half of the Newcastle defeat. Should the France international not make it, his place could go to South Africa forward Benni McCarthy.

• Frank Nouble is back at the club after being recalled early from his three-month loan at Swansea City.

• The Hammers will definitely be without Thomas Hitzlsperger (thigh), Jack Collison, Zavon Hines and Peter Kurucz (all knee).

Stoke City

• Stoke City will definitely be without Mali international striker Mamady Sidibe, who has been ruled out for the remainder of the 2010/11 season after suffering a ruptured achilles in the 2-1 home Barclays Premier League defeat by Tottenham Hotspur on 21 August.

• Jamaica forward Ricardo Fuller is struggling to be fit for the tie after suffering a shoulder injury. The man who scored Stoke's winner in their 1-0 Premier League victory at the Boleyn Ground last season was not risked in Sunday's 2-1 home defeat by Manchester United.

West Ham United
