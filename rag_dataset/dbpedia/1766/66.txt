2.2 The Branches of Government

The federal Constitution was written to ensure that government power is distributed and never concentrated in one or more areas. This philosophy is served by federalism, where the federal government shares power with the states. It is also further served by dividing the government into three branches, all responsible for different government duties and all checking and balancing each other. The three branches of government are detailed in Articles Iâ€“III of the federal Constitution and are the legislative branchThe branch of government responsible for creating statutory law., the executive branchThe branch of government responsible for enforcing statutory law., and the judicial branchThe branch of government responsible for interpreting statutory and constitutional law(s).. While the federal Constitution identifies only the federal branches of government, the principle of checks and balances applies to the states as well. Most states identify the three state branches of government in their state constitution.
