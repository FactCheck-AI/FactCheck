PRINCESS ACADEMY excels at blending the elements of a simple princess story with larger, more complicated truths about the world. What begins as a story about a town of girls training to one day be princesses, with the plucky and thoughtful Miri at the center, unfolds as a tale about community and friendship, as well as the power of education to transform communities and the power of confidence to help women reach their full potential. Along the way, there are subtle messages about the dangers of prejudice, the importance of being open-minded, and how fairness and respect are essential to good governance.

But mostly this is just a well-conceived adventure about leaving home, growing up, learning about the world, and returning to make your community better. For young girls interested in princess themes, it may be hard to return to lighter fare when presented with such compelling and complex storytelling that weaves together so many characters and concerns. It's hard to imagine a better use of the genre.
