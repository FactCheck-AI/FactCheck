An Interview with Shannon Hale:

Based on the Newbery Honor winning novel, Princess Academy by Shannon Hale, this heart-warming original Kensington musical of self-discovery will be back on our stage in December, 2021!

Princess Academy Summary:

High on the side of rocky Mount Eskel, far from the valleys where gardens are green and lush, where lowlanders make laws, Miri’s family has lived forever, pounding a living from the stone of the mountain itself. For as long as she can remember, Miri has dreamed of working alongside the other villagers in the quarries of her beloved mountainside. But Miri has never been allowed to work there, perhaps, she thinks, because she is so small or maybe her Pa doesn’t think she can do it.

Then word comes from the valley that the king’s priests have divined Mount Eskel to be the home of the prince’s bride-to-be—the next princess. The prince himself will travel to the village to choose her, but first all eligible girls must attend a makeshift mountain academy to prepare themselves for royal possibility.

At the school, Miri soon finds herself confronted by bitter competition among the girls and her own conflicting desires to be chosen by the prince and her blooming relationship with her best friend, Peder. Yet when danger comes to the academy and threatens all their lives, it is Miri who must find a way to save her classmates.

This production is being directed by Toni Butler and will be accompanied by a 30-piece orchestra directed by Michelle Willis on our main stage.

Director’s Note

When I first read Shannon Hale’s Princess Academy, I knew it needed to be a musical; music was part of the story’s fabric! Shannon and I used to participate in community theatre when we were teens. So, I approached my friend with the idea of writing a musical based on her award winning book about thirteen years ago… and five years ago we produced the world premiere of Princess Academy, the Musical! When COVID created huge obstacles for theatres around the world, I asked my board if we could return to Mt. Eskel this December; a safe, comfortable place. So here we are again!

The journey of Miri’s self-discovery is touching and inspiring. My hope for this new Mt. Eskel family is that they will also be empowered by good, hard choices. I hope they will walk with more confidence knowing that they are exactly the right person to make anything happen in their lives: “Look no further than your hand/ Make a choice and take a stand.” And sometimes life may not be what you expect, but exactly what you need: “Maybe Mt. Eskel didn’t need a princess, just an academy.”

We have loved creating this original musical! It has been a beautiful journey from beginning to end. We would love to share this musical with you (20 teen girls in the lead roles!!). Contact us if you would like to bring Mt. Eskel to your schools or communities (contact@KensingtonTheatre.org). A special thanks to Shannon for letting us put her beloved characters on stage. Mt. Eskel has certainly become an unforgettable home to our Kensington Family!
