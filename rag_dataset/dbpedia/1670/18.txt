Guard Chauncey Billups has decided to retire after 17 NBA seasons.

The 2004 NBA Finals MVP, a free agent after playing last season with the Detroit Pistons, told Yahoo Sports! of his decision Tuesday.

"It's just time. I know when it's time," Billups told Yahoo! Sports. "My mind and my desire is still strong. I just can't ignore the fact that I haven't been healthy for three years. I can try again and get to a point where I think I can go, but I just can't sustain. Me not being able to play the way that I can play, that's when you kind of know that it's time.

Billups turns 38 on Sept. 25. He has not appeared in more than 22 games in any of the past three seasons. He suffered an Achilles tear in the 2011-12 season with the Clippers and had knee surgery last season with the Pistons. Last season, Billups played in 19 games and averaged 16.3 minutes and 3.8 points a game. The Pistons declined to pick up his $2.5 million option for next season.

Billups reportedly had a workout last month for the Cleveland Cavaliers but was not signed.

Drafted No. 3 overall by the Celtics in 1997, Billups appeared in 1,043 NBA games while playing for the Celtics, Raptors, Nuggets, Timberwolves, Pistons, Knicks and Clippers. He finished with career averages of 15.2 points and 5.4 assists a game. He was an All-Star five times and led the Pistons to a five-game victory over the Lakers in the 2004 NBA Finals.

"Winning the championship was the ultimate," he told Yahoo! Sports.
