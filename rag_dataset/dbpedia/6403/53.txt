We could argue all day about the definition of Britishness in war films, but we all know what it means. This is the Think Defence list of the Top 25 British War Films

The definition of a British War Film is one that is largely British in character, they may have been directed by non-British directors, or have non-British actors in the cast. and may even have been made in Hollywood or elsewhere, but they retain that element of Britishness that we all understand.

So no Das Boot, Saving Private Ryan or Apocalypse Now, sorry folks.

The judging criteria do not include historical accuracy, whether the correct buttons and rank insignia were worn, or whether the film is a ‘visceral and worthy portrayal of the realities of war’ or some other such artsy bollocks, instead, it is simply enjoyability for a wet Sunday afternoon in.

It is not a list for the film buff, historian or the yoghurt-weaving wheatgrass smoothy types for them to bemoan the inhumanity and pointlessness of war.

Most of these have a backstory that is as good as, if not better, than the film.

25 – Breaker Morant

Breaker Morant (1980) Drama, History, War | 107min | July 3, 1980 (Australia) 7.9

Director: Bruce BeresfordWriter: Jonathan Hardy, David Stevens, Bruce BeresfordStars: Edward Woodward, Jack Thompson, John WatersSummary: During the Boer War, three Australian lieutenants are on trial for shooting Boer prisoners. Though they acted under orders, they are being used as scapegoats by the General Staff, who hopes to distance themselves from the irregular practices of the war. The trial does not progress as smoothly as expected by the General Staff, as the defence puts up a strong fight in the courtroom. —Kasper Sevaj <kaspsev@dorit.ihi.ku.dk>

An excellent film, what else is there to say?

Major Thomas: The barbarities of war are seldom committed by abnormal men. The tragedy of war is that these horrors are committed by normal men in abnormal situations.

Edward Woodward and Bryan Brown are excellent.

24 — The Heroes of Telemark

The Heroes of Telemark (1965) Action, Drama, History, War | 131min | December 3, 1965 (United Kingdom) 6.5

Director: Anthony MannWriter: Ivan Moffat, Ben Barzman, Harold PinterStars: Kirk Douglas, Richard Harris, Ulla JacobssonSummary: Set in German-occupied Norway, this is an embellished account of the remarkable efforts of the Norwegian resistance to sabotage the German development of the atomic bomb. Resistance fighter Knut Straud (Richard Harris) enlists the reluctant physicist Dr. Rolf Pedersen (Kirk Douglas) in an effort to destroy the German heavy water production plant near the village of Rjukan in rural Telemark. In the process, Pedersen discovers that his ex-wife Anna (Ulla Jacobsson) and her uncle (Sir Michael Redgrave) have also joined the resistance. British commandos dispatched to destroy the plant are killed when their glider hits the mountainside at night. An improvised raid by the resistance ends in the partial destruction of the heavy water canisters, but the contingency plans of Reichskommissar Terboven (Eric Porter) enable the Germans to resume production quickly. Pedersen wants to recommend to London that the Allies bomb the plant. Straud opposes him because of the potential death toll on Norwegian civilians and a fight ensues. They send in separate recommendations, and the air raid takes place, but it fails to destroy the heavy water. A Norwegian traitor gives away the resistance hideout, and Anna's uncle is killed. The Germans load the canisters onto a ferry for shipment to Germany, and the resistance rig explosives to sink the ferry in the fjord. As the ferry is about to leave, it is boarded by the widow and baby of one of Pedersen's and Straud's colleagues. Pedersen boards the ferry and organizes a children's game of "lifejacket" in order to minimize civilian deaths. This movie closes with resistance members rescuing passengers as the ferry sinks. —Peter Grosvenor

The scenery, Kirk Douglas’ chin, and the bit on the boat with the kids, nail-biting. Not particularly full of memorable quotes, though!

Terboven: Winston Churchill is puffing an extra big cigar today. And we laugh at him. Why? Because all these containers, which the British did so much to destroy, have already been pre-fabricated in Berlin. They are already on their way here and will be installed by tomorrow.

Nilssen: That is… I must say that is fantastic efficiency!

Terboven: Don’t you ever make the mistake of under-rating the Germans. By Easter we will have not merely 10000 pounds of heavy water, but 12000 pounds of heavy water.

An old-school war film, but one made especially interesting by the backstory, Hitler’s aspirations for atomic weapons and the at-all-cost effort to thwart them.

Surprise, a British frigate, is under the command of Captain Jack Aubrey. Aubrey and the Surprise's current orders are to track and capture or destroy a French privateer named Acheron. The Acheron is currently in the Atlantic off South America headed toward the Pacific in order to extend Napoleon's reach of the wars. This task will be a difficult one as Aubrey quickly learns in an initial battle with the Acheron that it is a bigger and faster ship than the Surprise, which puts the Surprise at a disadvantage. Aubrey's single-mindedness in this seemingly impossible pursuit puts him at odds with the Surprise's doctor and naturalist, Stephen Maturin, who is also Aubrey's most trusted advisor on board and closest friend. Facing other internal obstacles which have resulted in what they consider a string of bad luck, Aubrey ultimately uses Maturin's scientific exploits to figure out a way to achieve his and the ship's seemingly impossible goal. —Huggo

Senior civil servant: I see. So I tell the cabinet, that you’re trusting in radar and praying to God, is that right?

Acclaimed drama documentary Warriors depicts British soldiers’ experiences as peacekeepers for the United Nations Protection Force during the Bosnian War (1992-95), the psychological impact of the atrocities they witness but are not allowed to stop, and their struggle to readjust to civilian life. Although the characters are fictitious and Bosnian scenes were filmed in the Czech Republic, the production team thoroughly researched real events such as 1993’s Ahmići massacre through interviews, documents, archive footage and a visit to Bosnia by director Peter Kosminsky and writer Leigh Jackson.

The idea was for U.S. airborne divisions to take the towns of Eindhoven and Nijmegen and a British airborne division, reinforced by a Polish airborne brigade, to take the town of Arnhem. They would be reinforced, in due course and in turn, by the British XXX Corps, land-based and driving up from the British lines in the south. The key to the operation was the bridges, as if the Germans held or blew them, the paratroopers could not be relieved. Faulty intelligence, Allied high command hubris, and stubborn German resistance would ensure that Arnhem was a bridge too far. —grantss

Major General Urquhart: Hancock. I’ve got lunatics laughing at me from the woods. My original plan has been scuppered now that the jeeps haven’t arrived. My communications are completely broken down. Do you really believe any of that can be helped by a cup of tea?

Corporal Hancock: Couldn’t hurt, sir.

[Urquhart accepts his mug of tea]

Watch it because; it has a Bailey Bridge, an incredible storyline, and the fact that it had just about every actor of the day in it.

A story told with no sentimentality or commentary on some of the more obvious issues it raises

Spud McMellon: This country’s full of shit left behind when armies fucked off, Russians, it was the mines. Ten million fucking mines. God knows what we’re going to leave behind.

It is called Kilo Two Bravo for US audiences, but don’t let that put you off.

A humbling story of brave men and a brilliant film, whichever way you put it.

Director: Gerald ThomasWriter: Talbot Rothwell, LarryStars: Sidney James, Kenneth Williams, Charles HawtreySummary: Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond looks after the British outpost near the Khyber Pass.

Just soak up the glorious late sixties-era humour, Welsh scenery and the devils in skirts!

Captain Keene: [news of the native revolt arrives] What do you intend to do, sir?

Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond: Do? Do? We’re British. We won’t do anything…

Major Shorthouse: …until it’s too late.

Sir Sidney Ruff-Diamond: Exactly. That’s the first sensible thing you’ve said all day.

The dinner party scene, is one of the funniest pieces of cinema ever

2 — The Guns at Batasi

Guns at Batasi (1964) Drama, History, War | 103min | September 25, 1964 (United Kingdom) 7.1

Director: John GuillerminWriter: Robert Holles, Leo Marks, Marshall PughStars: Richard Attenborough, Jack Hawkins, Flora RobsonSummary: Regimental Sergeant Major Lauderdale (Sir Richard Attenborough) is a by-the-book, strict disciplinarian, who seems like an anachronism in a sleepy peacetime African outpost of the modern British commonwealth. Ridiculed behind his back by his subordinate N.C.O.s, he must play host to a liberal women M.P. making a tour of the base. However, when an ambitious African officer, who happens to be a protegè of the M.P., initiates a coup d'etat against Captain Abraham (Earl Cameron), the lawful African commandant, the resourceful Sergeant Major uses all of his military training to save his men from a certain firing squad. —Gabe Taverney (duke1029@aol.com)

Undoubtedly, the best portrayal of an RSM ever seen on screen (although perhaps a bit hammed up), a fantastic performance by Richard Attenborough

Headdress, in the mess, perish the thought!

Mr. Boniface! I’ve been a member of this Mess for 23 years, Sir. In all that time I’ve never seen anybody, man, woman or child, Sergeant, Warrant Officer, Field Marshal or Prime Minister walk into this mess with his hat upon his head. I do not see you now, Sir.

The trailer

See the clip, at about 3 minutes 40, RSM Lauderdale tears Mr. Boniface a new one!

Finally, in a scene that will be familiar to anyone who has ever dared not to salute an officer whilst in the presence of an RSM.

Forget the outrageous slurs on the good character of Private Henry Hook (who was a model soldier and campaigning teetotaller) and Commissary James Langley Dalton (who was the most experienced soldier at the mission station and widely credited with initiating the defence)

Singing, bayonets

The best bits are far too many to list.

Colour Sergeant Bourne: It’s a miracle.

Lieutenant John Chard: If it’s a miracle, Colour Sergeant, it’s a short chamber Boxer Henry point 45 calibre miracle.

Colour Sergeant Bourne: And a bayonet, sir, with some guts behind.
