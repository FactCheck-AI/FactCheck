It is the last wastewater railway in Switzerland. No motor powers the funicular instead wastewater from the upper town. A very special fragrance lingers in the air when the water tank beneath this vehicle is once again filled at the station - and the "Funi" has certainly earned its place on the list of cultural treasures of national importance.

Ascending a total 56.4 climb in altitude, the upper carriage uses filtered wastewater from the city in a 3000 liter tank (weight) to power it - and the driver regulates speed with the aid of cogwheel.

It's worth making a detour to hear the clanking and creaking of this century-old green railway, still running today thanks to the support of the Fribourg population – just a few minutes' walk from Fribourg station.
