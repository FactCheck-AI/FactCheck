British actor Bob Hoskins, best known for his role as the head detective in 1988’s live-action and animated hybrid, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, has died at the age of 71, his publicist revealed in a statement.

His death on April 29, after suffering a bout of pneumonia, comes two years after he retired from acting following a diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease.

Besides his turn in the ground-breaking Roger Rabbit, Bob also starred in a slew of acclaimed films such as Hook, The Long Good Friday, Mrs. Henderson Presents and 1986’s Mona Lisa, for which he received a Best Actor Oscar nomination.

Due to his declining health, the actor’s last role was in 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman, starring with Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart.
