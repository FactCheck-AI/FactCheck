MANILA, Philippines — Kapuso teen artist Andrei Sison died and three others were injured after the vehicle they were riding figured in an accident in Quezon City yesterday.

Sison, 16, was among the passengers of a BMW sedan that was traveling along the southbound lane of Commonwealth Avenue in Barangay Old Balara when the accident occurred at around 2:40 a.m., according to police.

Investigators said the vehicle was headed toward Philcoa when the driver lost control and sideswiped a Ford Ecosport sport utility vehicle.

The vehicle then hit a concrete wall of the subdivision.

First responders brought Sison, the driver and two other passengers to the East Avenue Medical Center but the actor later died.

Police are withholding the names of the other victims, two of whom are also minors.

Sison’s talent agency, Sparkle GMA Artist Center, confirmed he died in a car accident.

“Our sincere condolences to the family and loved ones of Andrei. We request everyone to respect his family’s privacy in this time of great loss and join us in praying for the eternal repose of his soul,” it said in a statement.

The talent agency said Sison is a “well-loved and much cherished member of the Sparkle family.”
