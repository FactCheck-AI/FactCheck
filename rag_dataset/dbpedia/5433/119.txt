In this columnist’s book, Rosa Aguirre is the Mater Dolorosa (Sorrowing Mother) of Philippine cinema. For she is on and off camera. Aside from portraying martyr-mother roles on the big screen, Rosa also suffered a heart-breaking experience in real life.

In the late ‘40s, her only child, also an actor, Narding Anzures, was involved in the murder of his leading lady, Lilian Velez, and her maid. Narding was convicted of double murder and sent to the penitentiary (Bilibid) and later committed to the National Mental Hospital. He was pardoned in the early ‘50s, but died of tuberculosis shortly after his release.

Rosa was the picture of a Mater Dolorosa as she attended the trial of her only son, visited him in prison, and eventually buried him.

‘Pretenders’ to the Mater Dolorosa title included Rosa Mia, Amelita Sol, Maria Cristina and Justina David. But as I earlier said, the title belongs to Rosa Aguirre and no one else.

Rosa was married to another actor, Miguel Anzures.
