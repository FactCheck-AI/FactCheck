Queens Park Rangers are one of four Championship clubs hoping to sign Fulham striker Jay Stansfield on loan for the season.

Stansfield, 20, was first included in Fulham’s first-team squad in the 2019-20 season and has made eight appearances for the club, including scoring against Birmingham in the Carabao Cup in August 2021.

The son of former Exeter striker Adam, Stansfield began his career in the Grecians academy. After making three appearances in the Premier League for Fulham early last season, he returned to Exeter on loan and scored nine goals in 36 matches in League One.

Stansfield is now back at Fulham but Standard Sport understands the striker is actively looking for another loan move this season — and the Cottagers are willing to grant him one if the right proposal comes up.

The former England Under-20s international has received at least four offers from Championship sides, with QPR one of the clubs interested in a season-long loan.

QPR sit 16th in the table two games into the 2023-24 Championship season, having lost 4-0 at Watford before beating Cardiff 2-1 on Saturday.

Scotland international Lyndon Dykes, 20-year-old Sinclair Armstrong and American Charlie Kelman are the only registered strikers in QPR’s first-team squad.
