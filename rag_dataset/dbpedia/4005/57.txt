Father Joseph Champlin established the Guardian Angel Society to encourage students to strive for high school graduation and beyond with support including tuition assistance, mentorship, and tutoring. It was his goal that financial burdens never stand in the way of a child’s desire for a great education. Guardian Angel Society tuition assistance is available to families of students who attend Cathedral Academy at Pompei or who have completed 6th grade at CAP and wish to continue their education at Bishop Grimes Junior/Senior High School, Bishop Ludden Junior/Senior High Schools, or Christian Brothers Academy.

(Please note: students must have attended Cathedral Academy at Pompei to be considered for Guardian Angel Society tuition assistance at the junior/senior high schools.)

The Guardian Angel Society is another avenue for tuition support outside of the Diocese’s or schools’ discretionary funds. Guardian Angel Society scholarship levels are assigned based on a family’s demonstrated need and ability to pay.

“Ability to pay” is calculated based on guidelines established in the Federal Register which provides income breakdowns using “Free and Reduced Lunch” thresholds. Several documents are required to apply for Tuition Aid Scholarships through the Guardian Angel Society. Please refer to the Tuition Aid Checklist to ensure all documents are gathered and submitted for review. These documents will include school registration forms, recent New York State and Federal Income Tax documentation and, for the secondary schools, academic release forms.

The Guardian Angel Society reviews applications in the spring of each year to determine scholarship awards for the following academic year. The Guardian Angel Society reserves the right to adjust tuition aid due to family size, circumstances, and ability to pay.

For more information about tuition assistance, please contact your school administrator or the Guardian Angel Society.
