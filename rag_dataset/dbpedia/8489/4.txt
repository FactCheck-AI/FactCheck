Queirós studied law at the University of Coimbra before embarking on a career in civil service. However, he soon abandoned this career to become a journalist and writer. His first novel, “The Crime of Father Amaro,” was published in 1875 and caused a scandal due to its frank portrayal of the Catholic Church and its clergy.

He was also a key figure in the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, which sought to overthrow the absolutist monarchy and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal.

In addition to his poetry, Garrett wrote several plays, including “Frei Luís de Sousa,” which is considered one of the greatest works of Portuguese literature.
