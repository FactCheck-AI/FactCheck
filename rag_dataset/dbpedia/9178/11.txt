She may have been born in Melbourne, but Savannah Guthrie hasn’t been back to her hometown in more than 40 years.

“I have no memory of it because I was too young,” Guthrie tells PEOPLE of her move to the United States at age 2. “But growing up and knowing that I was born in Australia was always this interesting exotic part of my history that I love.”

Which is why she jumped at the chance to travel back with her mom Nancy where the duo hit some very special places during their whirlwind trip.

First stop was the hospital where Guthrie was born in 1971, then off to visit her former childhood home.

“It’s been really meaningful and moving,” says the Today co-host. I think because I just had a baby I was really connected to that experience.”

But as exciting as the 6-day trip was, the new mom can’t wait to get back home to 8-month-old daughter, Vail.

“I talk to her right when she first wakes up and right when she goes to bed,” says Guthrie adding, “This is the longest I have been away from her.”

Now with her first Mother’s Day just around the corner, she couldn’t be more excited to celebrate.

“It s been the best experience of my life and she fills my heart,” says Guthrie.

“Just the happiest baby ever with the best disposition and personality. She just laughs and smiles. If I put her in a baby pageant she would win Miss. Congeniality for sure.”
