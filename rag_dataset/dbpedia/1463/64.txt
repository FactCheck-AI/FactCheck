Why Iceland?

View attachment 369622

The Iceland national football team has never qualified to world cup or european championship. Their best effort do this was playoffs to 2014 world cup,where they narrowly were beaten by Croatia.

Why lower leagues?

This is a far better challenge than for example starting with IA. The top divsion has been dominated in recent years by both KR and FH.

So we will start with 5-th tier Stokkseyri, which was founded in 1908 making it one of the oldest Icelandic football clubs.

Despite that they never had won a major trophy.

I'm definitely following this.

I'm assuming your club is amateur level and not semi-pro like the Premier & first division sides.

I've got a KR save going and i'm in the year 2035, yet I've still never heard of Stokkseyri.

They are amateur and the 8th least reputable club in Iceland. Odds to win the league 5000-1...

Cup "run"

First I had to face fellow 5th divsion side Einherji:

Despite they got more possesion and shots we had the cutting edge and we won!

2nd round was against Grindavik, the 2nd tier giants! Well they trashed us....

I'm not too upset, as i did the first season objective:

Hahaha I think this is so funny, because actually I've played with your main goalscorer, Barthosz Hoppa, in real life, with Stál-Úlfur team that plays in the 4th division in Iceland. He's an ok player at this standard, but he doesn't play anymore. I wonder how you got all the lower Icelandic leagues? Can you send me a link of the download? Wonder if I am in Stál-úlfur in this database you're using, you can check me up if you like, the name is: Gunnlaugur Jon Ingason...maybe send me a screenshot if I am

Cheers!

Thanks guys! There is a twist, because my file crashed, so i will start with the other lower league team if you aren't angry . I won't tell you the name now, but I can tell that the club isn't a good one not even close!

I took the file from FM-SCOUT.COM the link is: Iceland to level 5 for FM14
