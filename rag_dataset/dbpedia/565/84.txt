A tribute to one of Australian sports' purest sportsmen, Barry Davis, an outstanding VFL/AFL footballer in the '60s and '70s, who later coached his original league club Essendon.A three-time League premiership player, skilled, competitive and super fit, Davis led North Melbourne to its first ever flag in 1975. The image of him being embraced immediately afterwards by a grateful Barassi is one of footy's most-endearing images.This tribute by Barry's brother Ken comes 60 years after Davis first walked into Windy Hill beginning one of the most illustrious careers of all.A member of both the Essendon and North Melbourne's Teams of the Century, Davis was player, team-man, captain, coach, motivator, mentor and family man... he was truly Born to Play.
