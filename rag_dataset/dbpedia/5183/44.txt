ITEMS FROM J. H. BROWN'S HISTORY

SETTLERS OF DALLAS COUNTY 1841-1850. (Submitted by Dorman Holub)

The following is taken from John Henry Brown's history of Dallas county. As he is one of the very few pioneers still living who knew Dallas county when but a wilderness, and has seen her growth to her present wonderful status, and remembers the names of all the earlier settlers, whence they were and so forth, we give the following from his history:

"The actual settlement of Dallas county began in the spring of 1842, when the first cabin was erected and the families of John Beeman and Captain Gilbert were the first to arrive (Mrs. Martha Gilbert being the first American lady) and relieve the loneliness of the adventurous and true-hearted avant coureur, John Neely Bryan, who had for five or six months been 'monarch of all he surveyed,' provided, he neither surveyed red men of the forest nor the raging Trinity on one of its periodic 'spreads.' He entertained them with the best he had - chiefly bear meat and honey - perhaps without recalling the adage about 'entertaining angels unawares,' yet, it was verified in this case, for, ere a great while, the lonely son of Tennessee gave his heart and hand to a comely and pure-hearted daughter of Illinois, in the person of Margaret, a daughter of Mr. John Beeman.

In 1842, besides James J. Beeman and family, the families of Thomas Keenan, Preston Witt, Alexander W. Webb, John H. Cox, Perry Overton and others, arrived. The family of William M. Cochran came in March 1843. In May came the family of Dr. John Cole, with his grown sons, Calvin G.., John H. and James M., and other children; and in December, George W. Gloves and family, Elder Amon McCommas and grown sons, John, Elisha, Stephen B., and his brothers Stephen B. and John C., George L. Leonard and family and others.

In 1844 other members of the Cox family, the Cameron family, Isaac B. Webb and family, the Jenkins family, the Harwood family, the Rawlins family and many others came.

In 1845 came William H. Hord and family, William B. Elam and family, W. Hamp Witt and family, Thomas M. Ellis and family, John H. Daniel, D. W. Reedy, the Haught brothers, Adam C., Peter and Samuel A., with their families, John W. Smith and James M. Patterson (afterward the well-known first merchants of Dallas) both from Green County, Kentucky; John Thomas, wife, grown sons and daughters, from Missouri; James A. Coats, Marion A., and Thomas D. Coats, John C. McCoy, and others.

Among those arriving in 1846, were the families of Samuel Beeman, Mrs. Mary Ann Freeman, Obadiah W. Knight, William Traughber, I. N. Webb, John R. Fondren, Thomas Collins, James Collins (brothers), Albert G. Collins, Rev. James A. Smith, R. E. Rawlins and other members of the Rawlins family, Wormly Carter, Asher W. Carter, John Anderson, Marquis de Lafayette Gracy (single) and many others.

Couch, Henderson, as foreman of the jury at the first court ever held in Dallas county,

December, 1846; he and his 11 colleagues divorced Mrs. Charlotte M. Dalton from her husband, Joseph Dalton, and before the sun of that day glided to the "heathen Chinee" side of the globe; the said Henderson Couch and Charlotte M. Dalton, legally and constitutionally, were husband and wife. It was the first civil suit - Dalton vs. Dalton - ever tried in Dallas county; yet some people of this day imagine that the "early times" of Dallas were of the backwoods, "Arkansaw Traveler," non-progressive class, such as are found stuck away in certain spots in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and possibly a few in North Carolina and Virginia, but never in the prairies of the great West or Southwest. Let all such realize the electric dispatch business in early Dallas days, and be convinced of their former erroneous impression, then tip their beavers to the memory of Henderson and Charlotte Couch.
