The first thing newcomers notice about Denmark is that things just seem to work. Streets are clean and bicycle-friendly, locals give directions in near-perfect English, and services from train tickets to healthcare are bilingual and digitised on easy-to-use apps.

You’ll also see people living well – many clocking off at work before 5PM, spending time together and indulging in meals at a leisurely pace. The Danish way of living is so good it’s basically award-winning – with Denmark routinely ranking as one of the world’s happiest nations, home to some of the world’s most liveable cities.

Nestled between central Europe and the Nordics, think of Denmark as a gateway to the best of both worlds. To the south, we share a border with Germany, while our capital, Copenhagen, is only a 20-minute train ride from Sweden.

Denmark isn’t so much one landmass as a collection of islands strung together (which might be why the Danish Vikings got so good at sailing from place to place.) In Denmark, you’ll always be a maximum of 52 kilometres from the sea. And we swim all year round.

We’ll let you in on a discovery that may not surprise you: happier employees are more efficient. That’s convenient for us in Denmark, where well-being and flexibility are a big part of the culture. Most people in Denmark enjoy a 37.5-hour work week with lots of flexibility and social benefits – and Denmark still has a thriving economy.

In fact, the job market in Denmark is booming - and we’d love more international talent to come our way! So, if you’re looking for a healthier relationship with work and an exciting new career step, we think you should try Denmark.
