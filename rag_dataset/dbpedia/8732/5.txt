Denmark is a constitutional monarchy. It has a representative parliamentary system with a prime minister, who is the head of government, and a monarch, who is the head of state but whose duties are strictly representative and ceremonial. The kingdom also comprises 2 autonomous constituent countries in the Atlantic, neither of which are EU members: the Faroe Islands and Greenland.

Denmark ranks third in the European Union in terms of GDP per capita with €48 400, well above the EU average (€35 500). It accounts for 2.3% of the EU's total GDP.

How much does Denmark pay and receive from the EU?

The EU budget is the tool to ensure that Europe remains a democratic, peaceful, prosperous and competitive force. The EU uses it to finance its priorities and big projects that most individual EU countries could not finance on their own.

The benefits of EU membership significantly exceed the size of the EU budget contributions and the examples are many. All Member States benefit from being part of the Single Market, a shared approach to the common challenges of migration, terrorism and climate change, and concrete gains like better transport infrastructure, modernised and digitalised public services and cutting-edge medical treatment.

How much each EU country pays into the EU budget is calculated fairly. The larger your country's economy, the more it pays – and vice versa.

The EU budget is not about giving and taking – it’s about collectively contributing to making Europe and the world a better place for us all.
