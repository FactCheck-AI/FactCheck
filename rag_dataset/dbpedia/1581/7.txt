[Jamie Foxx]

Party in Ipanema, baby!

I wanna party,

I wanna samba,

I wanna party,

I wanna samba,

I wanna party,

And live my life, (my life)

I wanna party, (party)

And fly...

Hey! I'ma fly, fly just like a bird (but you are a bird!)

Oh yeah, you're right, so let me fly just like a rocket, then (okay!)

Fly so high where I need to come down for oxygen (hey!)

'Cause once we start it, baby, ain't no, ain't no stoppin' then (hey!)...

'Cause I just want to live my life and party (hey!)

All I want is to be free and rock my body (okay)

Ain't nowhere 'round the world that I wanna live my life

In Rio, 'cause in Rio, 'cause I Rio-realize that
