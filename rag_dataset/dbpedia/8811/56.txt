Roughly 200 people gathered last Thursday to pay their respects to Guri Lie Zeckendorf, the matriarch of the real estate family that developed 15 Central Park West, are principals in Terra Holdings, and own Brown Harris Stevens, a top-drawer brokerage.

Zeckendorf, who died Sept. 22, was also a diplomat and philanthropist.

The daughter of Trygve Lie, the United Nations’ first Secretary-General, she was married to William Zeckendorf, Jr., whose developer father owned the land that became the site for the UN.

(Their dads set them up on their first date.)

Her sons, Arthur and William Zeckendorf, run the family business today.

Last Thursday, a select group of 200 people gathered to pay their respects.

“Guri was not just a diplomat’s daughter, she was a daughter of the United Nations, too,” said UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who spoke at the memorial.

When her mother was ill, Guri acted as official UN hostess, welcoming presidents and kings, including Harry S. Truman and King Faisal. She accompanied her father on his second historic trip to Russia to meet Stalin and “holds the distinction of simultaneously dating two future presidents, Ronald Reagan and Francois Mitterand,” said Laurie Bogart Morrow, author of “The Hardscrabble Chronicles,” who spoke at the memorial.

“I was born,” Zeckendorf once wrote, “with an insatiable appetite for travel and adventure.”
