Borussia Dortmund will recover from their disappointing start to the season, veteran midfielder Sebastian Kehl insisted following the 1-0 home defeat to Hamburg.

The result meant a fourth league defeat in seven games for Dortmund, while it was Hamburg's first Bundesliga away win for almost a year.

But the BVB players were applauded by their fans on the Sudtribune, the biggest terrace in Europe, who sang: "When you lose and are rock bottom, we'll back you."

"That was a remarkable reaction from the fans and will surely help us," Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said.

Midfielder Kevin Grosskreutz said: "We can proud of that, but not of ourselves," and Kehl told Ruhr Nachrichten that while the club "are not going through an easy phase" he was "proud to be a Dortmund player."

"It does not help to bemoan or wallow in self-pity," he added. "We need to accept the situation as it is.

"We will not give up. We will get up again. The players who are set to return [from injury] will help us, even though we did not field a B-team on Saturday."

Dortmund travel to Cologne in a fortnight, when Marco Reus, Henrikh Mkihtaryan and Ilkay Gundogan -- who has not played since August 2013 because of a back injury -- could be back in contention. But they will be without left-back Marcel Schmelzer, who broke his hand against Hamburg and is expected to be out for four weeks.

"Ilkay is training normally and could be a squad member after the international break," Klopp told his postmatch news conference.

The coach admitted that Dortmund's performance against struggling Hamburg had been "miles from what we want," adding: "We didn't play enough football and didn't exploit the space on the wings enough."
