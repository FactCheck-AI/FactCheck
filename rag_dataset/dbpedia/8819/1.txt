The Kenyon College Bookstore will host an information session about "An Enemy of the People: A Theater Project from America's Hometown" with Bryan Doerries ’98 H'17, co-founder of Theater of War Productions.

Doerries will talk about founding the acclaimed theater company, its groundbreaking work using ancient texts to launch conversations about contemporary issues, and how the Kenyon community can get involved in this exciting project. The project itself involves two productions of Henrik Ibsen’s “An Enemy of the People,” adapted and directed by Doerries and featuring members of the Kenyon and local communities.

The productions will take place on Saturday, April 6, at 6 p.m. at Knox Memorial Theater in Mount Vernon and at Kenyon on Sunday, April 7, at 4 p.m. in Oden Hall Auditorium.
