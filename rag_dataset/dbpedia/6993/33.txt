The College is the oldest and largest academic unit at UNC-Chapel Hill and dates back to 1795.

The modern-day College of Arts and Sciences grew out of the College of Liberal Arts (1909-1935) and the School of Applied Science (1908-1935) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The former was established in 1909 by President Francis Preston Venable, who separated the duties of administering what was known then as “the College” from those of the dean of the university. The previous year, 1907-08, the Department of Applied Science, which had grown out of the School of Mines, had been renamed the School of Applied Science. In 1922 the School of Engineering was established; it maintained close academic ties to the School of Applied Science, although it was administered separately.

In 1935, following the transfer of the School of Engineering to North Carolina State College in Raleigh, the College of Liberal Arts and the School of Applied Science were merged to form the College of Arts and Sciences. The faculties within the College were organized into divisions based on academic discipline: humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. In 1963 the Division of Fine Arts was added.

Timeline

In 2018-19, the University celebrated its 225th birthday, harkening back to the laying of the cornerstone for Old East, its first building, in 1793. Although the College of Arts and Sciences didn’t take its current name until 1935, its roots are nearly as old as the University itself. The University considers the College’s founding date to be 1795, when Old East opened and students arrived.

Here is a timeline of when the College of Arts and Sciences’ modern-day academic departments and major centers, institutes and programs were founded. Many of the oldest departments trace their origins back to when the first faculty were hired, since formal departments did not exist until much later.
