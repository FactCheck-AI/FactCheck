CONTAINER SHIPS REFERENCE in the engineering of new-generation container ships,

Hitachi zosen brings efficiency, safety and economy to the forefront.

Hitachi Zosen's world famous, proven shipbuilding technology is now being applied to build a new generation of container ships that not only offers a greater load-carrying capacity, but improved labour efficiency, safety and economy as well.

Recently completed and delivered to the owners in Japan, the ultra-efficient 36,375 gross ton container ship "SHIN-BEISHU

MARU" (1,680 TEU, about 14 tons/container) typifies how Hitachi Zosen is always working to meet the growing demand for efficient shipping.

The "SHIN-BEISHU MARU" features a hull, engine and auxiliary equipment specifically designed to carry containers economically and efficiently.

The hull is designed for economical navigation at high speed â€” a bulbous bow enables greater speed with a minimum increase in main engine horsepower, and a bulged stern reduces hull vibration.

The machinery section is equipped to enable unattended operation of the engine room around the clock. Only 18 crew members are needed to run the ship efficiently.

And, for super-rationalized operation at the bridge, the control section is equipped with satellite navigation equipment, automatic steering equipment and a maritime satellite communications system. "SHIN-BEISHU MARU" is a prime example of how Hitachi Zosen's innovative technology carries the efficiency of new-generation container ships ever higher. Our technology can also build a new-generation container ship having the high performance you require.

Now more than ever, it's Hitachi Zosen for container ships that will meet your shipping needs at present, and far into the future.

For more information, contact Hitachi Zosen or the overseas representative nearest you.

Hitachi Zosen will be participating in the SNAME (2nd International Maritime

Exposition). Our booth numbers will be 227 and 229.
