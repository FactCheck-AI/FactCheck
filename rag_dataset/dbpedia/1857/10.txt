Their names are Emma Mærsk - built in 2006, Estelle Mærsk - 2006, Eleonora Mærsk - 2007, Evelyn Mærsk - 2007, Ebba Mærsk - 2007, Elly Mærsk - 2007, Edith Mærsk - 2007, and Eugen Mærsk - 2008.

Explorer-class container ship consists of seven ships of which three have length of 396 while others are shorter. They are in service since 2012.
