In July 2008, The Dark Knight---the highly anticipated sequel to Batman Begins---was released to roaring reviews. Now you can learn music from this record-breaking film with The Dark Knight Overture, a piano reduction of the exciting orchestral work, which was performed by the composers at the world-wide premiere in New York. This piece contains several key themes from the film's score and was specially arranged for Alfred Music by Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard.

About Original Sheet Music Edition

Each ORIGINAL SHEET MUSIC EDITION has been arranged for piano by Alfred's talented staff of arrangers. Every effort has been made for the arrangement to be playable on the piano and to sound as close to the original recording as possible. If there are lyrics, a separate vocal line is used so that singers can easily sing along, and all lyrics as heard on the original recording are always included. Almost all arrangements are written in the original key in which they were recorded.
