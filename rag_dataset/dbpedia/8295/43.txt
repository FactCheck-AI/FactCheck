New trackpad products for notebooks and Ultrabooks available for demonstration

TOKYO, May 31, 2012 /PRNewswire-Asia/ -- Alps Electric today announced its latest notebook trackpad products and solutions will be available for demonstration during COMPUTEX Taipei 2012. Alps' demonstrations will include its patented GlidePoint® NFC trackpad, EdgeAction™ gestures for Windows® 8, and new GlidePoint trackpads with integrated buttons.

GlidePoint NFC gives ODMs and OEMs a solution for notebooks and Ultrabooks that will work with new Windows 8 NFC "Tap and Do" features. GlidePoint NFC provides an easily discoverable interaction point for communication between PC and other NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones and tablets. For Ultrabooks with all-metal casings, GlidePoint NFC is the ideal solution to implement near field communication technology. Alps' GlidePoint NFC trackpad is based on Cirque Corporation's patented integration of an NFC antenna and a touch sensor (US Patent 7,306,144 and patents pending).

EdgeAction gestures provide users an effortless ability to manipulate the new Metro interface in Windows 8 using a GlidePoint trackpad. These new gestures build upon Alps' standard gesture suite that includes two, three, and four finger gestures. Furthermore, GlidePoint trackpads include precise single-finger tracking, TouchGuard™ palm rejection technology, and industry-leading noise immunity.

GlidePoint trackpads with integrated buttons offer a high-performance solution that overcomes many usability issues prevalent in existing buttonless products. Common usability problems that exist are poor cursoring and misrecognition of gestures due to a resting finger in button zones. Alps' GlidePoint trackpad overcomes these and other issues, providing a reliable user experience.
