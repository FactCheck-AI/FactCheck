Popped Hot Air Balloon, And Suckers

"Big Red was her favorite horse until I stripped down.”

-- Charles “Hank” Bukowski

Born Andernach, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany,

raised South Central LA, racetracks

back in the Reagan years

may have been Buk’s version

of Herman Hesse´s anti-fascist Magister Ludi.

There was a bunch of us cocky experts

who hung out besotted among the crappy leftover buntings

and balloons at the top of Hollywood Park’s

stretch section of the bleachers.

Practically every day I was there, including

the weekend of our high school ball.

Hank sat about ten rows behind -- even worse view

albeit the decisive action takes place around that turn.

The huge beast who didn’t wear clothes well was always alone.

Finally I got up the nerve to ask him to autograph

the Daily Racing Form I gave to my kind of date

instead of a corsage.

One day following him through the trash of torn tickets

to the $2 window, we couldn't believe our ears:

Hank bet the goddamn favorite to show!

For all his horse race ruminations,

the Master of the Game actually knew nothing.
