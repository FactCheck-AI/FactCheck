Welcome to…

…masterfully played brawny riff rock and detached cool jazzy rock thoughtfully sequenced for a powerful peaks and valleys listening experience…Though evoking the majesty of such icons as the Allman Brothers, Steely Dan, Eric Clapton, Little Feat, and Santana, the South Florida-based sextet is of its own modern vintage with a sonic bouquet spanning notes of classic rock, folk, soul and traditional R&B. Dark Horse Flyer is Don Mularz (lead vocals, guitar), Scott Lane (guitar, vocals), John Tillman (guitar), Richard Taylor (bass) Raul Hernandez (drums, percussion) and Bob Taylor (keyboards).
