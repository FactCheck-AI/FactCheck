Description

Pentair Pool Products (Pentair) is the largest producer of consumer and commercial pool equipment within the U.S. and has been a presence in the City of Moorpark since 1987. It is also one of the largest employers within the City; currently providing approximately 700 jobs. Pentair has outgrown its 234,000 square-foot existing building and is seeking to expand.

Pentair is working with Amir Development Company c/o Moorpark Lot A, LP (Applicant) to submit an Industrial Planned Development Permit and Conditional Use Permit to develop a 90,566 square-foot industrial building and associated site improvements on 5.65-acres of land at 10941 Los Angeles Avenue (directly to the east of 10951 Los Angeles Avenue). The proposed industrial building would be occupied by Pentair for the use of warehouse and storage of pool equipment.

The Project was approved by City Council on November 2, 2022.
