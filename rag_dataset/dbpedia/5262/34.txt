Pentair, a world-wide sustainable water solutions company, contracted us to build out their 44,000+ square foot office space in the Pinnacle III building in Brookfield, WI. The project, completed in May 2018, boasts offices, an employee lounge, machine shop and laboratory testing center. The unique lab allows for a variety of testing scenarios, in-floor sanitary drainage for testing stations, a reverse osmosis system, recycling and reuse of water, and multiple tanks that hold more than 15,000 gallons of water. Our crew dug more than 200 feet to accommodate a well with a minimum required pressure of 40 PSI to support a dozen high and low velocity pumps used for testing.
