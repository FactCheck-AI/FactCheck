Singer-songwriter and record producer Kenneth Edmonds, known by his stage name Babyface, shared Friday on social media that he previously tested positive for the novel coronavirus and is now negative.

Alongside the caption “Stay home, stay safe,” he acknowledged his 62nd birthday by thanking people for the well wishes.

“I feel so blessed to be able to celebrate another birthday,” wrote Babyface. “I tested positive for the Covid-19 virus, as did my family. It’s an incredibly scary thing to go through my friends.”

He then added, “I am happy to report we have now tested negative and are on our way back to full health.”

Babyface noted that he is happy to accept the invitation from Swizz Beatz and Timbaland to participate in what he calls a “Celebration of Black Music Excellence.” The hip-hop and R&B event is set to take place Saturday, April 18, at 6 p.m. PT on Instagram Live.
