SEOUL -- South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday pardoned his disgraced predecessor Park Geun-hye for the sake of national "harmony," just months before a presidential election in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.

Park has been in prison since 2017 after receiving a 22-year sentence for crimes including taking bribes from Samsung and other conglomerates through her lifelong friend Choi Soon-sil. Park will be released from jail next week.
