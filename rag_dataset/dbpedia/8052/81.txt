SEOUL -- South Korean President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol played a key role in indicting the country's previous conservative president, Park Geun-hye, five years ago. This week he sought to bury the hatchet by paying the pardoned ex-leader a visit.

"The past is the past. I told her my regret and said I was sorry, as that feeling has stayed with me," Yoon told reporters after spending 50 minutes at Park's home in the conservative stronghold in the southern city of Daegu. "We talked about how the president is doing and if there's anything she is not comfortable with."
