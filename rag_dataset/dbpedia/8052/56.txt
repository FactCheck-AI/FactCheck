Park guilty of bribery, coercion, power abuse, leaking secrets

Disgraced former leader can now appeal to a higher court

Park Geun-hye, South Korea’s first female president, was sentenced to 24 years in prison after being found guilty of crimes that exposed deep links between politics and the nation’s corporate giants.

A panel of three judges at the Seoul Central District Court found the former leader guilty of most of a dozen charges ranging from bribery to coercion, abuse of power and the leaking of state secrets. The sentence was more lenient than the 30 years sought by prosecutors. Park can now appeal to a higher court.
