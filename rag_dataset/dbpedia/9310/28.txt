Aaron Ramsey is moving alongside the likes of Wimbledon tennis icons Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer, golfing legend Tiger Woods and fellow footballers Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in having his own logo.

The Welsh international revealed on social media on Monday morning the launch of a new logo and website.

He tweeted out: "I am delighted to announce the launch of the Aaron Ramsey logo and visual identity.

"A new chapter starts here. aaronramseyofficial.com."

Ramsey's move to Juventus from Arsenal this summer will see the midfielder feature alongside the likes of Gianluigi Buffon, Ronaldo, Giorgio Chiellini and Paulo Dybala in Italy.

And the 28-year-old is following in the footsteps of team-mate Ronaldo, who launched his CR7 brand and website in 2014, with a logo and site of his own.

Ramsey's career with the Turin-based Italian giants officially got underway on July 1.

He signed a four-year contract with Maurizio Sarri's side who have won the last eight Serie A titles in a row.

He will become the third Welshman to wear Juventus' famous black and white shirt, with Ramsey following in the footsteps of John Charles and Ian Rush.

Ramsey's current Wales team-mate Gareth Bale is someone who has made millions from his own image rights.

Bale is the second richest young sports star in Britain and Ireland, with the Welsh football icon now worth a mammoth £94m.

He rakes in millions through endorsements and has even trade-marked his signature heart-shaped goal celebration. It's believed he pulls in well in excess of £10m a year through sponsorship deals.

Bale also earns handsomely from social media. Bale has more than 35m Instagram followers and pulls in approximately £160,000 per sponsored post.
