When you feel like giving up, be reminded that God loves you and wants to live life to the full! God's plan is to prosper you and not to harm you. If you're struggling in life, don't give up - there are better things yet to come!

While there are many things that demand our time and attention that we should leave behind such as unhealthy relationships, jobs, and habits, it's also important to keep fighting for what is good and right. Fight for your success, fight for your marriage, fight for your kids, fight for your health - don't give up! Know that you are not alone, and know that we are in the hands of God - He will provide us with strength when we need it. Use these Bible verses about not giving up to find renewed strength in God. Keep going!
