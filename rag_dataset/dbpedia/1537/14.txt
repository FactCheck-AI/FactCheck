Jerzy Kossak (Polish, 1857 – 1942)

14 ½” x 10″ Soldier on horseback. Oil on artist’s board, signed lower right corner, in gold leaf frame, overall 22 ¼” x 17 ¾”. Jerzy Kossak was a Polish realist painter specializing in military scenes; son of painter Wojciech Kossak and grandson of painter Juliusz Kossak — a third-generation artist from a well-known and sought after family of painters, writers and poets. Jerzy was a prolific painter of mostly historic scenes featuring the famed Polish Uhlans on horses, usually sold on the spot, but also used for barter at times of the postwar economic slump, until his death before the end of Stalinism in Poland. His paintings, along with those of his antecessors remain best-selling of Polish art.

Condition: Very good, small flake to pigment left center where the sky meets the horizon.
