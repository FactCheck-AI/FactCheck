XPF is the currency code for the CFP franc (or Franc Pacifique), the currency used in the French overseas collectivities of French Polynesia, New Caledonia, and Wallis and Futuna. The currency symbol for the CFP franc is usually displayed as “₣” or “F,” and it is pegged to the euro at a fixed exchange rate.

The CFP franc was introduced to the French overseas territories in the Pacific after World War II, replacing the French Polynesian franc in French Polynesia and the New Caledonian franc in New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna. The currency’s fixed exchange rate with the euro provides stability for these territories’ economies, helping to moderate inflation and promote economic growth.
