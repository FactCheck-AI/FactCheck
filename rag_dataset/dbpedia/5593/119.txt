American actress, producer and singer Drew Sidora is instantly recognisable to a swathe of millennials after her recurring role in the Disney Channel Original Series That’s So Raven, in which she portrayed the fashionable and humorous Chantel. She’s also well-known for her role as Lucy Avila in Step Up (2006), a film in which she lent her vocals to two top songs in the soundtrack: ‘Til The Dawn’ and ‘For The Love’, both featuring modern R&B legend Mario. A talented vocalist, she also featured on the soundtrack for Three Can Play That Game (2007) with a song titled ‘Three Can Play’. Further film features include the comedies White Chicks (2004) by the Wayans brothers and Wild Hogs (2007), which starred Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence.

She also played a fictionalised version of herself in BET produced comedy-drama television series The Game (2006) and made a memorable turn in CrazySexyCool: The TLC Story as Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, one of the three singers at the heart of the iconic hip hop musical trio TLC.

In possibly one of the most exciting developments of her career, Sidora is set to join and shake up Bravo’s hit reality show Real Housewives of Atlanta for Season 13. She also intends on shining in further acting projects, having most recently starred in the upcoming comedy film White People Money.
