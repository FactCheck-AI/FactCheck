Jeanine is a graduate of St. Louis University and was a high school history teacher and professional educational trainer for 15 years before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. Jeanine is thrilled to have a wonderful husband, Terry and son, Jake who carried her through her own cancer journey with their strength, support and love. Her own battle with breast cancer inspired the creation of Little Pink Houses of Hope. Jeanine is amazed at all of the wonderful people that she has met through her service and is thankful that God showed up in her life in such a big and powerful way to put her on this mission. She currently resides in Burlington, NC with her family.
