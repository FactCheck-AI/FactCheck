What is a group text?

A group text is a message a sender distributes to many recipients at once.

Also known as group SMS, this form of fast and efficient communication gives your organization the ability to communicate or market to the masses with the simple click of a button.

A group text messaging service allows businesses to add people to group text messages and connect with assortments of people, large and small, all at once. Share special offers, announcements, all within a single text blast.

Recipients open 98% of text messages, making group texting one of the most effective ways to reach people quickly. But unless you want all of your recipients on one text thread, you can’t use your phone’s built-in messaging app.

That’s where our group SMS marketing software comes in. Our service allows you to send a group text without reply all to any number of recipients. This means when an individual replies to your group text, only you will receive that reply (and not your entire contact list).
