4°, original printed wrappers (chipped; spine defective). Frontisportrait of João de Deus. In good condition. Contemporary signature near top of front wrapper. Postmark of Lisbon, [illeg.] January 1896 of rear wrapper. 89 pp., (1 l.). *** First edition thus. The preface by Eugénio de Castro in the form of a poem occupies pp. [7]-14. The pedagogue and poet João de Deus (João de Deus de Nogueira Ramos, 1830-1896), was born in São Bartolomeu de Messines, Algarve. He studied law at Coimbra, where he was linked to the "Geração de 70", especially Teófilo Braga. Part of the second wave of romanticism in Portugal, he is credited with a revival of lyricism, and, along with Antero de Quental, the rehabilitation of the sonnet. The poet, diplomat and university professor Eugénio de Castro (Eugénio de Castro e Almeida, 1869-1944) introduced Symbolism to Portugal; as a young diplomat in Paris he came into contact with the great French symbolist poets, becoming a friend of Jean Moréas and Henri de Régnier. His influence can be seen even on such established Portuguese writers as Guerra Junqueiro, and he undoubtedly paved the way for Camilo Pessanha and Mário Sá Carneiro. Castro's verse ("often so perfect, always so artificial," says Bell, Portuguese Literature p. 337) signaled the return to poetry of careful thought and planning, as opposed to the inspired improvisation of the Romanticists, and led to the cult of "art for art's sake" or "estheticism" that became prominent in Portugal ca. 1925.*** Fonseca, Aditamentos, p. 197.
