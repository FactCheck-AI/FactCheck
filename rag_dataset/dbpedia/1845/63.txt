Amongst those whose names appeared recently in the London Gazette for the award of the British Empire Medal (Civil Division) is that of Mr. William Doyle, formerly of Athy, and son of Mr. John Doyle, canal side, Athy, and brother of Miss Polly Doyle, Athy.

Mr. Doyle is a leading storeman in charge of issue at No. 3 N.U., R.A.F., Malton, England, where he has been employed for the last eighteen years. For twenty years previously he was in the Royal Navy, serving throughout the 1914-18 war and retiring with the rank of leading stoker. Group Captain F. A. R. Smith, officer commanding No. 3 M.A., says the award â€œis the result of long and meritorious service, which has been appreciated by a continuous number of commanding officers there, including myself. Mr. Doyle is well respected and is very well fitted for the award.
