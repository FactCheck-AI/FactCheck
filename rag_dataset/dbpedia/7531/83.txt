Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach (1804-1872) was a German philosopher and a member of the philosophical school of thought known as the Young Hegelians, followers of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. However, he would later go on to turn against Hegel's philosophy. Feuerbach was a proponent of atheism and materialism. His best known work is The Essence of Christianity, which argued that god was simply the projection of the human mind. The works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Friedrich Engels were heavily influenced by Feuerbach.
