STERBA PROP Good Recent Re-finished Condition, 70/76 pitch, 160 mph indicated at 2k msl off my Tailwind/Cougar Lycoming O-320 160 hp engine $325. https://photos.app.goo.gl/HerSBDSmV5PWdKTB7

3/8" PROP BOLTS and CRUSH PLATE with adapters to fit above Sterba Prop, $50. https://photos.app.goo.gl/M52b1sdqkvdhNNsAA

4" SABER PROP EXTENSION 3/8" bolt holes to fit above Sterba Prop, $325. https://photos.app.goo.gl/GLEy293TvsZvTPtZA

Yes the Sterba Prop could be installed with 7/16 or 1/2 inch bolts. With the attached picture I have tried to show how the prop is setup. The bolt is 3/8 in a tubing adapter which is in a 1/2 hole (the 6 bolt holes are about .500 -0/+.03 diameter). If you wanted to put tubing adapters in the prop holes you would probably have to lathe down the right size tubing.

The crush plate is 6 inches. I can make a new custom crush plate out of aluminum or steel any thickness and diameter you want for 50 to $60. I have the NC vertical mill and the code for these already done.

I have two 4" extensions for sale, one is 3/8 and the other is 7/16.
