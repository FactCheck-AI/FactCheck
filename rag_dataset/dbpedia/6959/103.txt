Black Market Activities, the label helmed by THE RED CHORD frontman Guy Kozowyk, has announced a new distribution and artist development deal with Good Fight Entertainment.

Founded in 2010 by the metal/hardcore pioneers behind Ferret Music, Good Fight Entertainment consists of a record label and music management company, united under one roof. The label's roster boasts FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND, MADBALL, THE CHARIOT, CANCER BATS and more, while the management roster features the likes of BEHEMOTH, BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, CANNIBAL CORPSE, CHILDREN OF BODOM, EVERY TIME I DIE, JOB FOR A COWBOY, SICK OF IT ALL, TERROR, and TORCHE.

Black Market Activities' Guy Kozowyk, who ended his label's distribution deal with Metal Blade Records earlier this year, says this about Black Market Activities' new deal with Good Fight: "The new deal keeps us distributed through Sony's RED Distribution, whom we have worked with for years now via our prior distributor, Metal Blade Records, and also opens up new doors for artist development. With Good Fight, we have the management team responsible for artists like BETWEEN THE BURIED AND ME, BEHEMOTH, CANNIBAL CORPSE, and JOB FOR A COWBOY, lending a hand with developing bands on the Black Market Activities roster."

With the Good Fight deal in place, Black Market Activities reveals a stellar list of new releases lined up for early summer, including new music by ENGINEER, KHANN, FIT FOR AN AUTOPSY, ED GEIN, and Black Market Activities' newest signing, the legendary TODAY IS THE DAY.

Kozowyk expands more on what fans can expect from Black Market Activities: "This deal marks an exciting new chapter for Black Market Activities.

"When we were out searching for a new distro deal, working with Good Fight just felt right for everybody involved. I have known those guys through the scene for years and I have so much respect and admiration for everything they have done with every avenue of their companies. They have been extremely open and responsive to several new progressive ideas we have brought to the table, which is very important since the music industry is changing so rapidly. Among those ideas is that of functioning on a more limited model the idea that, in this age of digital music, there's still a place for CDs and vinyl, it's just on a more limited, 'collector's item' basis.

"As a music fan, I'm the type of person who wants to read the layout cover to cover and have the artwork and lyrics in my music collection. With many of our upcoming releases, we will be issuing limited runs of CDs and colored vinyl with download cards for those of you, like me, who want the physical product. There will be limited shirt and music package deals in our webstore and, of course, the albums will be available digitally.
