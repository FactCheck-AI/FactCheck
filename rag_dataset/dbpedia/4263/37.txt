Chondrichthyes: Chondrichthyes, also known as cartilaginous fish, represent a class of jawed fish characterized by skeletons primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone. This sets them apart from osteichthyes, or bony fishes, another major group. Members of Chondrichthyes include sharks, skates, rays, and chimaeras.

There are approximately 1,000 species of cartilaginous fish, distributed across all oceans and some seas. They vary greatly in size, ranging from the dwarf weasel shark, measuring only about 6 inches (15 cm) in length, to the whale shark, which can reach lengths of up to 50 feet (15 m). Cartilaginous fish play a significant role in marine ecosystems by helping to regulate prey populations. NEET Biology Notes on Chondrichthyes are provided in the article below.

Chondrichthyes Classification

Chondrichthyes, commonly referred to as cartilaginous fish, belong to a class of jawed vertebrates characterized by their skeletons primarily composed of cartilage rather than bone. This diverse group includes sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras.

The taxonomy of Chondrichthyes is structured as follows:

Kingdom: Animalia

Phylum: Chordata

Subphylum: Vertebrata

Superclass: Gnathostomata

Class: Chondrichthyes

Chondrichthyes are further classified into two subclasses:

Elasmobranchii: This subclass encompasses sharks, rays, skates, and sawfish. Elasmobranchs are characterized by their entirely cartilaginous skeletons, five to seven pairs of gill slits located on their bodies’ sides, and placoid scales, which give their skin a rough texture.

Holocephali: This subclass comprises chimaeras, also known as ghost sharks. Holocephalans possess a distinctive head structure with a single median dorsal fin and a bony plate in their upper jaw. Unlike elasmobranchs, holocephalans have four pairs of gill slits covered by an operculum (a bony flap) and cycloid scales resembling those of bony fishes.

Chondrichthyes Characteristics

Chondrichthyes, commonly known as cartilaginous fish, comprise a diverse group of jawed fish distinguished by unique features that differentiate them from their bony counterparts, the Osteichthyes. The key characteristics of Chondrichthyes are as follows:

Cartilaginous Skeleton: Chondrichthyes have skeletons primarily composed of cartilage, a flexible connective tissue. Although some calcification may occur for reinforcement, they lack the true bones found in Osteichthyes.

Placoid Scales: Their skin is covered in tough, tooth-like placoid scales structurally similar to teeth. These scales reduce drag during swimming and provide protective armor.

Heterocercal Tail: Most Chondrichthyes possess a heterocercal tail, characterized by an asymmetrical tail fin where the upper lobe is larger than the lower lobe. This design enhances swimming efficiency and is reminiscent of sharks and some primitive bony fish.

Gills for Respiration: Chondrichthyes extract oxygen from water through their gills. Unlike bony fish, they lack swim bladders, relying on constant swimming to maintain buoyancy.

Predatory Nature: Most Chondrichthyes are carnivorous, adapted for hunting with keen senses, powerful jaws bearing multiple rows of replaceable teeth, and streamlined bodies for efficient movement. Sharks, skates, and rays are examples of Chondrichthyes.

Cold-Blooded: Chondrichthyes are poikilothermic, meaning their internal body temperature fluctuates with the surrounding environment, as they lack mechanisms for regulating their temperature.

Chondrichthyes Examples

Chondrichthyes, commonly known as cartilaginous fish, represent a diverse group of jawed fish characterized by skeletons composed primarily of cartilage instead of bone. This group includes several notable examples:

Sharks: Among the most recognizable cartilaginous fish, sharks exhibit a wide range of sizes and shapes. From the enormous whale shark, exceeding 40 feet in length, to the diminutive dwarf pygmy shark, measuring just 6 inches long.

Rays: Rays are flat-bodied fish that inhabit the ocean floor. They possess wing-like pectoral fins used for swimming and burrowing in the sand. Common types of rays include stingrays, manta rays, and electric rays.

Skates: Skates resemble rays but feature more pointed snouts and triangular pectoral fins. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters worldwide.

Chimaeras: Also referred to as ghost sharks, chimaeras are a group of deep-sea fish distinguished by a rabbit-like snout and a long, slender tail. Chimaeras are the least common type of cartilaginous fish.

Chondrichthyes Reproduction

Chondrichthyes, known as cartilaginous fishes, encompass a diverse group that includes sharks, skates, rays, and chimeras, each exhibiting intriguing and varied reproductive strategies. Unlike bony fishes, which typically rely on external fertilization, chondrichthyes employ internal fertilization.

Reproduction in Chondrichthyes is broadly classified into two categories: oviparity and viviparity.

**Oviparity**

Oviparity involves females laying eggs with a tough outer shell that are then deposited in the marine environment. These eggs contain a yolk sac, which serves as nourishment for the developing embryo. Oviparous species within Chondrichthyes include skates, some sharks (such as horn sharks and bullhead sharks), and chimeras.

The egg cases of oviparous sharks can be quite intricate. Some species lay screw-shaped egg cases that anchor themselves to seaweed, preventing them from being swept away by currents. Others lay eggs with tendrils that allow them to attach to vegetation or the seafloor.

Systole and Diastole

**Viviparity**

Viviparity represents a more advanced reproductive strategy, where embryos develop inside the mother’s body. Viviparous sharks and rays employ various mechanisms to nourish their developing young. Some rely solely on the yolk sac for nourishment, a process referred to as yolk-sac viviparity. Others have evolved a placental connection, akin to mammals, where the mother provides additional nutrients and oxygen to the embryos, known as matrotrophic viviparity.

The gestation period for viviparous chondrichthyes can vary greatly, ranging from a few months for some rays to up to two years for the great white shark. Litter sizes also vary, with some species giving birth to just a single pup, while others may have litters of dozens of young.

Chondrichthyes are Oviparous or Viviparous

Chondrichthyes, which include sharks, rays, and chimaeras, are generally ovoviviparous, meaning they produce eggs that hatch inside the female’s body, and the offspring are born life. However, some species are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs outside the body, where they hatch later.
