James Madison born Port Conway, Virginia, 1st of 12 children of James Madison and Nelly Conway Madison. The Madisons' considerable wealth in land, slaves, and tobacco provides for family home, Montpelier, in Virginia's Orange County, and for eldest son's education. James is an excellent student but a frail and sickly child.

*March 5 by Old (Julian) Calendar, March 16 by New (Gregorian) Calendar. New Calendar adopted by Great Britain and its colonies in 1752. To bring calendar in line with solar year, 11 days added; new year begins in January rather than March.

Enters College of New Jersey (now Princeton); graduates in 1771. Compiles books, collections of aphorisms, and other texts and, like most 18th-century students, commits parts of these texts to memory for future use. One such book, "A Brief System of Logick," appears to have been written by Madison during his years at College of New Jersey.
