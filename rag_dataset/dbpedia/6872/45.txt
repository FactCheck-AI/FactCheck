James Madison (March 16, 1751 – June 28, 1836) was a founding father of the United States and the fourth American president, serving in office from 1809 to 1817. The Virginia-born Madison composed the first drafts of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights and earned the nickname “Father of the Constitution.” [citation needed]

James Madison was born on March 16, 1751, in Port Conway, Virginia, to James Madison Sr. and Nellie Conway Madison on his maternal grandparents' plantation. The oldest of 12 children, Madison was raised on the family plantation, Montpelier, in Orange County, Virginia.

In 1776, representing Orange County at the Virginia Constitutional Convention, Madison was advocate for a strong federal government.

In 1792, Madison and Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) founded the Democratic-Republican Party, which has been called America’s first opposition political party. When Jefferson became the third U.S. president, Madison served as his secretary of state. In this role, he oversaw the Louisiana Purchase from the French in 1803.

Dr. Charles Everett served as a physician to Madison as well as to Jefferson and Monroe.

Madison died at Montpelier, Montpelier Station, VA, in 1836, outliving both Jefferson and Monroe.
