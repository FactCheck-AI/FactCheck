Biting, Snow-Chilled Wind Made Newcastle Shiver

A biting wind blowing off snow at Barrington Tops and other ranges to

the north-west of Newcastle today caused temperatures to drop to the lowest

levels this winter.

At Merewether early this

morning tne temperature drop-

ped to 41 degrees, and at 9 a.m.

was only 44.5 degrees at Mere-

wether and 44 degrees in the

city.

Although temperatures rose

slightly to 51.5 degrees in the

city and 46 degrees at Nobbys

at 1p.m., light sleety rain con-

tinued to make conditions as

unpleasant as for many years.

The co-proprietor of Barring-

ton Guest House (Mrs. I.

Roach) reported that snow was

still falling around the Tops

at 9 a.m.

Only 28 Degrees

At the guest house the tem-

perature at 8.30 a.m. was only

28 degrees.

Freezing conditions generally

were reported from the Hunter

Valley, where snow, sleet and

light rain have fallen.

At Wingen, more than a foot

of snow fell early this morning.

One local inhabitant who had

lived in the district for 47 years

said it was the heaviest fall

he had ever seen.

The fall had been general

throughout the district. Win-

gen is 11 miles north of Scone.

A light fall of snow is also

reported from Muswellbrook.

Early today snow is reported

to have fallen on Bell's Moun-

tain, about two miles north-east

of the town. Light rain later

melted the snow in this area.

Another Cold Night

Mr. R. W. Parker, of Mere-

wether, forecasts that little re-

lief can be expected and he an-

ticipates another very cold

night.

Conditions during the week-

end are expected to be fair with

cold, brisk north-west to south-

west winds.

Heavy overcoats, scarves and

mittens gave little protection or

warmth to early morning work-

ers as they hurried to their jobs.

The wind blew in gusts which

reached up to 35 miles an hour.

Although skies were overcast

during most of the night, little

rain fell, only four points being

registered for the 24 hours end-

ed 9 a.m.

Indicating how the cold snap

had developed, Mr. Parker says

that the maximum temperature

yesterday was 65.5 degrees, but

this had dropped to 42 degrees

by 10 o'clock last night.

Light Rain

The minimum temperature of

41 degrees was recorded in the

early hours of the morning.

The minimum temperature

recorded at Nobbys was 42 de-

grees, and the temperature at

Nobbys at 8.30 a.m. was 43

degrees.

Although light rain continued

to fall after 9 a.m. registra-

tions were negligible.

Mr. Parker recorded the mini-

mum temperature ol 41 degrees

during the early hours of this

morning. At 6 a.m. it was 45

degrees, but dropped to 44 de-

grees at 9 a.m.

There was a slight clearing

in the weather between 11 a.m.

and noon, but temperatures,

though rising slightly, remained

low.

Cessnock experienced its

coldest day this year with a

minimum of 39 degrees about 5

a.m. At 11 a.m. the mercury

had risen to 42 degrees.

Although there was a cutting

wind there are no reports of

snowfalls on the mountains

west of Cessnock.
