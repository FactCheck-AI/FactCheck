Lots of action on the Hannibal front recently, with more and more images popping up in anticipation of the film's February release. Here's a rundown of some places where you can catch a glimpse of Dr. Lecter...if you dare.

The guys over at Coming Attractions snagged several new photos from the Dutch UIP site. The photos show Julianne Moore in action as Clarice Starling, as well as a nifty shot of a bound-and-masked Dr. Lecter (smaller version on right).

CA also points out CHUD's new review of screenwriter Steven Zaillian's February 9, 2000 draft (revising an earlier draft by David Mamet) of the Hannibal screenplay. If you're comparison shopping on script reviews, you can check out our review by IGN FilmForce correspondent Jay Christianson, who looked at the same draft of the script a while back.

Various websites are quoting a recent interview Hannibal director Ridley Scott gave to the New York Post, in which he said the following about adapting the novel: "I think it's a great book, but I told Tom [Harris], I just don't buy these two going off together, even with Clarice under the influence...He said, 'Fine, see what you come up with.' Tom was very happy with Steve Zaillian's screenplay, in which Hannibal and Clarice's affair of the heart is much more metaphorical."

Meanwhile, more pics have popped up at Guerrilla-Film.com. These stills were taken from the MGM 2001 Interactive press kit; in addition to three nice Hannibal shots, there are also stills from Rollerball, Windtalkers, and Original Sin.
