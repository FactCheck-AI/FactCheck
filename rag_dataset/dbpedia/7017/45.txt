I have advised eighteen doctoral student to their degree, of which the four last ones after my retirement in 2006. They are from seven different countries, and our discussions have been conducted in four different languages.

While in office, I was the scientific advisor of fourteen doctoral students, who successfully defended their theses (1974—2005). Since then I have been the principal scientific advisor of four PhD students, who got their degrees in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2016; the first two at Uppsala University, the third a Stockholm University, and the last at l'Université des Sciences, des Techniques et des Technologies de Bamako (USTTB).
