New Delhi, October 14, 2019: With Mariam Theresa’s canonization on October 13, India has six natives as saints of the Catholic Church. The list also includes eight saints born overseas but closely linked to India such as Mother Teresa and Francis Xavier.

Close on the heels of them are three who have been beatified, the penultimate stage in the four-phase canonization process.

Just behind them are 15, who have been declared venerable. They include seven Indians and eight missionaries from overseas.

As many as 44 people are now “Servant of God,” the first stage in the canonization process.

The first Indian to become a saint is Gonsalo Garcia, a native of Vasai, Maharashtra, who was martyred on February 5, 1597, in Nagasaki, Japan, when he was just 46. He was beatified on September 14, 1627, and canonized on June 8, 1862.

India then waited 146 years to get its second native saint – Sister Alphonsa, a member of the Franciscan Clarist Congregation. She was the first woman of Indian origin to be canonized, and the first saint of the Syro-Malabar Church. She died on July 28, 1946, aged 35. She was beatified by John Paul II on February 8, 1986 and canonized by Pope Benedict XVI on October 12, 2008.

Two Indians were canonized on the same day – Kuriakose Elias Chavara, a member of the Carmelites of Mary Immaculate, and Euphrasia Eluvathingal, a member of the Congregation of Mother Carmel – on November 23, 2014.
