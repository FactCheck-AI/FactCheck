Synopsis

It’s London, 1937, and recently-widowed eccentric, Laura Henderson (Tracie Bennett), is looking for a way of spending her time and money when her attention falls on a run-down former cinema in Great Windmill Street. Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm (Ian Bartholomew) to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo present a bill of non-stop variety acts. But as war looms something more is required to boost morale and box office… When Mrs Henderson comes up with the idea of The Windmill Girls – glamorous young women posing as nude statues – audiences flock. And as the Blitz hits London, The Windmill provides a refuge for all, boasting the spirit-raising slogan “We Never Close”.

About

Based on the much-loved film that starred Dame Judi Dench and Bob Hoskins, Mrs Henderson Presents is the hilarious new musical with lyrics by Don Black, music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain and book by Terry Johnson. The show’s initial run at the Theatre Royal Bath was hailed by the Guardian as “a shot in the arm for the British musical” and led Quentin Letts of the Daily Mail to exclaim, “I have not emerged from the theatre feeling quite so cheerful in a long time.” Mrs Henderson Presents opened February 9, 2016 at the Noel Coward Theatre in London’s West End.
