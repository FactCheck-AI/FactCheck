The Accra Metropolitan Assembly (AMA) has announced plans to build a hall of fame in honour of Ghanas founding fathers. The hall will be located near Accra sports stadium just east of the city centre and will house statues of the so-called Big Six: Kwame Nkrumah (1909-1972), the first president of independent Ghana; Edward Akuffo Addo (1906-1979), president of Ghana 1970-1972; Joseph Boakye Danquah (1895-1965), lawyer, philosopher, writer and opposition politician; William Ofori Atta (1910-1988), foreign minister under president Akuffo Addo; Emmanuel Obetsebi Lamptey, a lawyer; and Ebenezer Ako Adjei (1916-2002), foreign minister 1959-62. All leaders of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), the first political party in the country, the six men were arrested and detained by the British colonial government in 1948 following riots in Accra before leading the country to independence in 1957. The plans for the hall must now go before the government for approval before construction can begin.
