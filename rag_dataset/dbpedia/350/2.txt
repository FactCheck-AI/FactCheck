A short film about the horseshoe crab research conducted by professor of zoology Win Watson is among 36 selected for viewing at the 2018 American Conservation Film Festival in Shepherdstown, West Virginia, this month.

Research on the use of the horseshoe crab’s bright blue blood by the biomedical industry is at the heart of the film. Watson, associate director of education at the School of Marine Science and Ocean Engineering, has been trying to determine if the bloodletting process that drains about 30 percent of the horseshoe crab’s blood affects their health. He and graduate student Meghan Owing discuss their findings in “Auditing the Blue Blood Bank,” which aired Oct. 14.

The American Conservation Film Festival presents films from around the world on topics ranging from agriculture to climate change to wildlife.
