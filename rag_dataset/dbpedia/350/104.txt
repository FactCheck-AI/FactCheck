You could call the Diamond Horseshoe the Creep Club and Billy Rose might be Joe Blow for all that matters. True, it lends an authenticity and realism which are undeniable. But more potent are the plot components. It builds a solid heart story in a manner which is enough of a switch on the backstage formula to make it different.

Betty Grable and Dick Haymes are co-starred and this, of course, puts the crooner over solidly as a film juvenile. William Gaxton plays Haymes’ father, the lead at the Horseshoe, forever squabbling with Grable, the No. 1 cheesecake. Haymes gives up medicine for a stage career, and while Grable starts out under a cloud she emerges the noble influence to get him back to his MD studies, an objective in which Gaxton fails and for which he had blamed his son’s romantic vis-a-vis.
