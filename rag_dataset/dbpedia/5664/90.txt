Confronting ISIS 1x115, 2x54

Reporting from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey, FRONTLINE correspondent Martin Smith presses government and military officials to describe the conflict from their perspective and give their recommendations on how to move forward. Confronting ISIS examines the successes, failures and challenges of the U.S.-led fight to degrade and destroy ISISâ€”no one wants to see ISIS succeed, but the lack of common priorities between the U.S. and its allies in the Middle East has complicated the fighting process. This two-hour special investigates as ISIS loses ground in the region, but strikes out abroad.
