Obama’s War 1x53

Tens of thousands of fresh American troops are now on the move in Afghanistan, led by a new commander, and armed with a counter-insurgency plan that builds on the lessons of Iraq. But can US forces succeed in a land long known as the “graveyard of empires?” FRONTLINE producers Martin Smith (Beyond Baghdad, Return of the Taliban) and Marcela Gaviria (In Search of Al Qaeda) once again make the dangerous journey to the frontlines of America’s biggest fight. Through interviews with the top US commanders on the ground, embeds with US forces, and fresh reporting from Washington, Smith and Gaviria examine US counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan: a fight that promises to be longer and more costly than most Americans understand.
