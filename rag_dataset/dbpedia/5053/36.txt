Penny Garner, a member of Quincy Public Schools for 30 years said, “I have been a physical education teacher with other administrators that didn’t even know my name. Mr. Webb is always stopping by my class to exercise with my students, asking about my curriculum and my family. The leadership, Mr. Webb has provided, allows for students, in Quincy, to have physical education five days a week. He sees the value in what is taught and staff feel supported. He shows support by ‘walking the walk’; for example an early childhood class went to the local YMCA so students could get in the swimming pool. Mr. Webb was there in the water with the students. Mr. Webb has shown up at staff wellness groups to participate in Pilates. Every student and staff member knows who Mr. Webb is and feels the respect he gives. In the words of Mr. Webb, ‘Be all you can be’."
