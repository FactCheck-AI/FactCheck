The “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” are coming to the

University of California.

Gov. Gray Davis appointed the show’s producer, Haim Saban,

to the UC Board of Regents on Friday.

A resident of Los Angeles, Saban founded Saban Entertainment in

1988 and merged his company with the Fox Kids Network in 1995. Two

years later, he acquired the Fox Family Channel.

He supports The Story Project, an after-school literacy program

in Los Angeles, as well as The Fulfillment Fund and Partners in

Education. He also founded the Saban Institute for the Study of the

American Political System at the University of Tel Aviv.

Saban, who has donated about $400,000 to the governor since

1998, is estimated to be worth $1.3 billion.

The governor’s appointment of Saban must be confirmed by

the state Senate.
