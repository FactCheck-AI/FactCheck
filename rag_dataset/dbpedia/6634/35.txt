BERKELEY (AP -- A University of

California regent who had been criticized for his attendance record at board

meetings announced Wednesday he is stepping down.

Regent Haim Saban, a Los Angeles

businessman who founded Fox Family Worldwide and Saban Entertainment, producer

of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, said in a statement that he is resigning

effective immediately due to personal reasons.

"My position on the board was an

honor, and I feel blessed to live in California and hope to be given the opportunity

to serve this great state again in any way," said the 59-year-old Saban, who

was appointed to a 12-year term by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002.

Earlier this year, state Sen. Jeff

Denham, R-Merced, had recommended that Saban resign after the San Diego Union-Tribune

reported that Saban had missed a majority of board meetings.

UC records indicate Saban's attendance

waned after his appointment. In the 2001-02 year, Saban attended all six meetings

of the investment committee of which he was a member, according to university

records. For the 2002-03 year, Saban attended one of his five audit committee

meetings and five of 12 investment committee meetings.

UC's board is made up of 18 regents

appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state senate, one UC student

appointed for a one-year term, and seven elected officials, including the governor.

Regents set policy for the nine-campus

system, which has more than 200,000 students and an annual budget of $14 billion.

Current regents include John Moores, owner of the San Diego Padres, and Sherry

Lansing, chair and CEO of Paramount Pictures Motion Picture Group.

Regents are unpaid and are expected

to attend six, two-day board meetings per year. They also are expected to participate

in other committee hearings, some of which are held by teleconference, that

may be scheduled at other times in the year. They make campus visits and are

sent thick stacks of documents to read before meetings.
