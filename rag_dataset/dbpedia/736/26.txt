This photograph is widely posted on the internet and identified as John Mapes Adams, aka George Lawrence Day. This is incorrect. The photograph is actually William Seach in a WWI era uniform. This information has been confirmed by Seach’s grandson, William ‘Bill’ Seach.

We just added a page entitled Lost to History which lists the Recipients whose burial location is unknown and what if any information we have on them that may aid a researcher in locating them. To access these new pages, please click the tab entitled Medal of Honor
