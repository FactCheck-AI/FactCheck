Michael, I'm happy that you finally unravelled the mystery!My background includes six years studying history at the University of Munich in Germany, so I am very familiar with a lot of the information you were given.

The places you mention are all located in western Germany in the northwestern part of what was until 1945 the Prussian province of WESTPHALIA, the capital of which was the city of Münster, and the largest city in which is Dortmund.

"Münster", by the way, is a German word and means "cathedral" and has a close English counterpart in the now antiquated word "minster", which you find, for example, in such names as Westminster Abbey.

Following World War II and the break-up of the vast state of Prussia (in German: Preussen; capital: Berlin) by the Allies, the northern half of the Prussian Rhineland or Rhine Province, the Prussian province of Westphalia, and the very small state of Lippe (capital: Detmold) combined to form today's German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (in German: Nordrhein-Westfalen), with the city of Düsseldorf in the Rhineland as its capital.

You mention "Loeders" being written "Löders" in Germany.The rule in German is that if the "Umlaut" (two dots) is left off of a vowel where it should be, the "Umlaut" gets replaced with the letter "e".Thus, "Löders" became "Loeders" in America.

You also make mention of property worth "950 Thaler" (pronounced: TAHL-er, "h" being silent in the letter combination "th" in German).The English word "dollar" is derived from the the German "Thaler".The Thaler was Prussia's unit of currency until 1875.In 1875, the Mark was introduced as the new unified Germany's new unit of currency, replacing the local currencies of the various German states.(Like the U.S., Germany has always been made up of states, the largest of which until 1945 was Prussia.)

Here is the link to a map of pre-1945 Westphalia, so that you know what it looked like.You will see Westphalia's capital, Münster, a city of about 270,000 people today.You will note that Westphalia borders on the Netherlands or Holland (in Dutch: Nederland) in the northwest.The towns you mention are all 35-40 miles west-northwest of Münster, near the Dutch border, northwest of the city of Coesfeld.To give you an idea of size as you look at the map, Westphalia covers an area a little larger than that covered by the U.S. states of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.

Again, I'm glad you solved the mystery!And now that we know the places that were actually meant, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.
