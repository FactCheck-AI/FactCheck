This photo, taken in 1950 during the filming of Gable's 1950 racing movie To Please a Lady, was originally from the collection of Donna Belanger Haniford, daughter of Murrell Belanger, owner of the car. Duane Carter was the driver.

Marshall Corns, a licensed 3-A mechanic who worked on the car at that time, brought in his copy of the photo. While damaged, it may still be of interest to people in the community.
