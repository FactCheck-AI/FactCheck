Description

NDS Flo-Well is a manufactured dry well that is an easy to install and sustainable solution for storm water runoff. Used independently or as part of a larger storm water management system, Flo-Well units collect, retain, and discharge storm water on-site, offering a gravel-free alternative to a traditional dry well. Units are modular and can be connected in series or stacked to meet a variety of project needs and accommodate higher volumes of water. The NDS Flo Well is easy to install and does not require heavy equipment. It is environmentally friendly, made from 100% recycled materials and filters storm water naturally through subsurface, reducing pollutants and helps replenish ground water tables by discharging storm water on site.
