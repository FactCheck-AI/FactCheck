What is Pink Wings of Hope?

Mission

Pink Wings of Hope shall empower the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community with education and support to make well-informed decisions in regard to their health and treatment options.

Vision

A cancer diagnosis can be frightening and overwhelming. Pink Wings of Hope provides assistance through education to help cancer patients make well-informed choices for their health and treatment options.

History

Four Deaf and Hard of Hearing women shared their stories about surviving breast cancer. They had all experienced communication issues where they did not receive critical and important information about cancer or treatment options. There were no support groups in the area that provided support for the deaf or hard of hearing personâs needs. As a result, these women founded Pink Wings of Hope (pictured right) on October 11, 2009.

Originally, the goal was to provide support for breast cancer survivors and patients going through treatments. Today, Pink Wings of Hope has expanded their support for fighting against all cancers which affect people in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community.
