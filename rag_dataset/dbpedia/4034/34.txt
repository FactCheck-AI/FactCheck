Alan Bates and Gordon Brown headline in King’s Birthday Honours

King Charles's Birthday Honours list has been announced tonight and includes famous faces like former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Post Office campaigner Alan Bates and actress Imelda Staunton.

The King releases two honours lists per year, one in the new year, and another on his birthday.

A total of 1,077 people from across the UK received honours in Friday's list, with 64 percent of them being people who showed "outstanding work" in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity, according to the award organisers.

The highest award went to Mr Brown who was made a Companion of Honour, while Sir Alan was knighted in recognition of his campaigning work which highlighted the Post Office Horizon scandal.

Artist Tracy Emin, actress Imelda Staunton and fashion accessories designer Anya Hindmarch were all made dames in the list, while writer Armando Iannucci was made a CBE and cyclist Mark Cavendish was knighted.
