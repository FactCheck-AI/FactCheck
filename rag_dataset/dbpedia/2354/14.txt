Kalleshvara Temple, Aralaguppe, Karnataka, is located 64 km west of Tumakuru.

Built in 9th century CE by Nolambas, the temple has influences of western Ganga architecture style.

The highlight of the temple is an exceptional ceiling panel in the Maha mantapa; consisting of well ornamented Shiva in the middle with 4 flying Vidyadharas (Gandharvas) with garlands in their hands at each corner.

A decorated, large Nandi (Bull) is another attraction here.
