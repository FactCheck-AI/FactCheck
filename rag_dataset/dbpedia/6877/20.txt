Napesca, company belonging to Zamakona Yards is working on the vessel Kampen with IMO 9214587, changing the main engine crankshaft. The vessel belongs to Eckhoff GMB & CO and is currently docked at the Reina Sof√≠a pier in the Port of Las Palmas. The project is being carried out in cooperation with Wartsila, one of the world leaders in marine engines.

The engine model is the Wartsila 8L46B with 8 cylinders in line, running vertically and producing 10,605 horse powers at 500 revolutions per minute. The crankshaft weighs 15,000 kg and measures 8 meters.

The work is highly complex, as the engine block, weighing 120.000 kg, is being lifted. Further, Napesca reinforced the deck to hang the weight of the engine in the roof of the engine room as well as opened a hole behind the engine to remove the old crankshaft and introduce the new one.
