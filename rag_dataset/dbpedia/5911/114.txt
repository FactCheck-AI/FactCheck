I'm running a dual core Mac Pro, OS X 10.6, .. running Logic. My hard drive recently crashed and I've needed to re-authorize my pluggins. Haven't had any issues except for Spectrasonics. Neither Omnisphere, Trilian or Stylus RMX gives me a Challenge code for me to enter into the Spectrasonics website. Oddly enough it gives a Response code. I've tried everything I know to remedy the situation and nothing's worked. I've run each synth in demo mode so I know they work properly. Here's a list of the steps I've taken in troublshooting : 1. updated all latest synths 2. tried authorizing in another platform, (DP7) 3. tried authorizing under a new user account 4. tried a full re-install of Trialian 5. tried using VST Lord Any help in knowing what else to try is welcome. I've re-installed and re-authorized several times over the years and have never had this issue. thanks g

Hmmm, that is odd! What exact version of OSX are you running?? Click on the Apple menu (top left) and choose "About This Mac" Also, try moving the Spectrasonics preference files to the desktop and then re-authorising. Go to *Your Home folder* / Library / Preferences / and move: net.spectrasonics.V1.plist net.spectrasonics.V4.plist to your desktop temporarily. Now launch Logic and try re-authorising. ---- Also try repairing permissions: [url]http://www.macprovideo.com/forum/general/general-general&id=13874[/url] Any luck? Do you have any additional software like Little Snitch running that may block an application from 'calling home'? Thanks Rounik
