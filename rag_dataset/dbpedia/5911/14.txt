but it works ok in studio one and reaper.

There was a error also trying to login, so you can download the updates from here if you can't log in as well.

Will the keygen 2048 work after the update?

Well thank you @Spyfxmk2 .. once yet again the crack Customer Service of Spectrasonics failed to notify me of an important update. I might not have known about it unless I read about it on this very page. It is double cool as I must have done something to the hierarchy of the Steam folder about five months ago. I have been getting notifications upon starting up the instrument that I needed to reinstall the original sound sources and was not able to access any of the factory presets through the preset window of the gui. Now, after installing these updates I have everything back to specification. Everything magically sorted itself out. Sooooo nice.
