Integrity Music is honored to announce that it has extended its longtime relationship with renowned worship leader, author and pastor Darlene Zschech and is preparing for the March release of a new live album from Zschech and her church, Hope Unlimited, in New South Wales, Australia.

“Darlene has been a huge inspiration to worship pastors and leaders globally and we are honored to have her as part of the Integrity Music family,” says Adrian Thompson, Integrity’s Vice President of Song and Artist Development. “She has an undoubted call on her life to build up worshippers and mentor worship leaders, aligning with what we believe God has called us to do as an organization.”

“I couldn’t be happier to enter this next season of writing and recording with Integrity Music,” says Zschech. “It literally feels like coming home. My heart is filled to overflowing with thanksgiving and songs, and I cannot wait to share them.”

Zschech’s new album is slated for global release on March 3. The project features new songs penned by Zschech and her church members along with guest writers. The album is Zschech’s first project following her battle with cancer and the first since the 2013 release of her critically acclaimed album Revealing Jesus.
