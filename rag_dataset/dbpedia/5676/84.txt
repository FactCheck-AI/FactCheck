MOBILE, Alabama -- Integrity Media has put its west Mobile headquarters up for sale, raising questions about the Christian music firm's future.

Richard Weavil, a commercial real estate agent, said he was hired last month to sell the six-building campus, which faces Cody Road south of Airport Boulevard. The 29-acre property, including the six buildings, is listed at $5.95 million.

Integrity has declined to answer questions about whether it has been sold or is moving.

“As a privately held company, we do not generally comment on rumors,” spokeswoman Shannon Walker wrote in an email to the Press-Register last month.

Calls Thursday to founder P. Michael Coleman's office and home were not returned.

Weavil said he doesn’t know what’s happening to the company, or when it might move out of its complex. Weavil said that the facility, especially the 42,000-square-foot, three-story anchor building, is among the nicest office spaces west of Interstate 65. He said he plans to market it to corporate and educational users, although he said an investor could also buy the property to lease in smaller pieces.

Christian music firms, like their secular counterparts, have struggled with falling album sales and the transition to digital media.

Founded in 1987, Integrity started out by selling music directly to consumers. It expanded into selling through stores, music publishing, digital music, videos, greeting cards and other media. As the firm flowered, it sold stock to the public for $9 a share in 1994. But share prices plunged, and some shareholders complained that the company was making large donations to a nonprofit that became the Integrity Worship Institute.

In 2004, Coleman bought back all the shares from the public for about $15.5 million. Its last public filing in 2003 showed almost $70 million in revenue. The Gale Group estimated revenue at $67 million in 2010.

In 2009, the company had 139 employees in Mobile.
