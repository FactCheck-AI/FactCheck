Baldacchino has extended his loan spell with Ayr

Gretna winger Ryan Baldacchino has agreed to a second month on loan at Second Division club Ayr United.

The winger suffered a serious knee injury against Forfar Athletic two years ago and sealed a loan move to Somerset Park earlier this season.

Baldacchino played in the Honest Men's 2-1 defeat by Alloa and against Partick in the Scottish Cup.

But he missed the trip to Peterhead after suffering a calf strain. He is in the squad to face Raith on Saturday.
