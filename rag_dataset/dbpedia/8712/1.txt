New Delhi: Actress and former Miss India Earth Reshmi Ghosh, who often plays the antagonist's role in daily soaps, will retain her image in the upcoming "Maharakshak Aryan" weekend fantasy show. She says she loves characters with a negative angle.

"I love to play negative roles and make others cry. Although it's different from my off screen image, it helps me to perform in unique way and destress myself," Reshmi told IANS in an interview here.

Reshmi, who was crowned Miss India Earth in 2002, became a popular small screen face via her role as Bhoomi in the long-running soap "Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi". She went on to feature in shows like "Karam Apnaa Apnaa", "Kayamath" and "Shobha Somnath Ki" and also tried her luck in Bollywood with "From Sydney with Love".

Now, she will be seen in "Maharakshak Aryan", a superhero show, which will be aired on Zee TV starting Nov 1.

Reshmi will don the role of Vishkanya for the show.

Talking about the role, she said: â€œVishkanya is a very different role, which I have not done in the past. I was not ready for this role, but my husband (Siddharth Vasudev) advised me to do it.

"Vishkanya talks in a poetic way...the flavour, costume and the way she speaks caught hold of my attention."

Meanwhile, the 27-year-old is currently enjoying sharing screen with her husband and actor Siddharth in "Buddha". The duo married in February 2013.

She is glad that her husband is "extremely professional".

"He is a different person on the set. He doesn't allows me any leniency onscreen. When I need him, he is there for me like he is for other co-stars."
