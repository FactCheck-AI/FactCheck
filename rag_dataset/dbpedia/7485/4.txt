Hotel on the Cay, located on a lush, five acre cay (pronounced key) has a long history of intrigue dating back to the 17th century when pirates anchored their ships off the beach where guests now sunbathe, swim and snorkel. Our property (many believe was the inspiration for Herman Wouk’s famous book Don’t Stop the Carnival) is a beach front hotel located on Protestant Cay, a two minute boat ride from the King Christian Hotel.
