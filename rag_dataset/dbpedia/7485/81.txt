One of the Caribbean's most elegant and exclusive enclaves, Lyford Cay, located on the western edge of New Providence Island in The Bahamas, has served as a refuge for global leaders, international luminaries, and royal families for more than half a century.

In the heart of the community is the Lyford Cay Club, a meticulously appointed private retreat that lavishes attention and five-star amenities on club members and their guests with an impeccable combination of world-class service and recreation options. On-site facilities include a state-of-the-art tennis and fitness center, an 18-hole Rees Jones-designed golf course, sailing, fishing, and water sports, indulgent spa services, and much more.

In addition to the finest white sand beaches in the islands and a well-protected 74-slip yacht harbor, the Lyford Cay Club also provides luxury guest accommodations, premium dining opportunities, and an exciting calendar of social events year-round. It has become a popular destination for weddings and corporate outings with our expert staff dedicated to insuring members and their guests receive the ultimate in care.
