Notes to editors

Knight Bachelor

A knighthood rewards a pre-eminent contribution in any field of activity usually, but not exclusively, at a national level, or in a capacity which is recognised by peer groups as inspirational and nationally significant, and which demonstrates sustained commitment.

A Knight Bachelor is an appointment, not a membership of an Order of Chivalry. Recipients can adopt the title “Sir” and there are no post nominal letters associated with the award.
