No, not "Poltergeist." Here's something truly more disgusting and ridiculous: "Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead." The latest film from Troma Entertainment has everything you need for schlocky horror -- gore, green slime and musical numbers.

Arbie's (Jason Yachanin) high-school girlfriend Wendy (Kate Graham) returns to Tromaville after a semester at college with a girlfriend of her own. The women protest the opening of the new fast-food franchise American Chicken Bunker, which bulldozed an American Indian burial ground to make way for its chicken goodness. Any Troma or "Poltergeist" fan knows what that means: pissed-off dead Indians, paired with the souls of dead chickens that were forced to live in "chicken concentration camps" -- resulting in giant chicken zombies with a thirst for human flesh. To get back at Wendy, Arbie takes a job at American Chicken Bunker. Toilet humor and death ensue, in between lurid musical numbers about Wendy and Arbie's love and the benefits of corporate greed and franchising.

"Poultrygeist" is truly offensive, but it's brilliant in that it pretty much insults every conceivable group: fat people, corporate America and guys who dress up as babies as a kinky sex game. For those brave enough for the gallons of fake blood and chicken slime, Friday's two screenings at St. Anthony Main will be followed by an after-party at Stasiu's Place with a pie-eating contest and live music from the Trailer Park Queen, Lady Hard-On, Unicorn Basement, Falcon Crest, Gay Witch Abortion and Impaler. Troma's Lloyd Kaufman, who directed and co-wrote the film, will speak at both the screening and the after-party.
