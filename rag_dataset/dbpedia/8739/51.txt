A quick definition of constitutional monarchy:

A constitutional monarchy is a type of government where a king or queen is the head of state, but their power is limited by a constitution or other rules. This means that they cannot make all the decisions on their own and must follow certain guidelines. It is different from an absolute monarchy where the monarch has complete control. In a constitutional monarchy, the monarch's role is often more ceremonial and symbolic.

A more thorough explanation:

A constitutional monarchy is a form of government where a monarch serves as the head of state within the parameters of a constitution. The monarch's powers are limited by law and they act as a figurehead, with the real power held by elected officials.

United Kingdom: Queen Elizabeth II is the constitutional monarch, but the real power is held by the Prime Minister and Parliament.

Japan: Emperor Naruhito is the constitutional monarch, but the real power is held by the Prime Minister and the Diet.

These examples illustrate how a constitutional monarchy works. The monarch serves as a symbol of the country and performs ceremonial duties, but the real power is held by elected officials who are accountable to the people. This system provides stability and continuity, while also allowing for democratic governance.
