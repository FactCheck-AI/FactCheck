On National Authors Day and in the spirit of National Novel Writing Month, How To Be Books engaged in an insightful conversation with Julia Cameron, the acclaimed author of “The Artist’s Way.” A book that has guided many towards finding their true creative path.

Unpacking “The Artist’s Way”: creativity beyond writing

Julia Cameron, a poet, playwright, fiction writer, essayist, and award-winning journalist, reflects on the essence of the book, saying, “I wrote a book about the art of being creative. So it could be writing, it could be painting, it could be acting, any of the arts.” The inception of the book, she shared, was born out of frustration over how artists were being treated. She wanted to pen a manifesto urging better treatment and respect for artists.

Considering the ongoing challenges artists face, like the WGA strike, which has subsequently come to a tentative agreement, as well as concerns over how creatives are treated, Cameron feels things have improved. “I think we’re being treated a little bit better, and I think that the reason we’re being treated a little bit better is because people have more understanding of what creativity is. And that came about, through the book,” she notes.

One of the key methods Cameron champions is the practice of ‘Morning Pages’. She describes it as, “three pages of long, hand morning writing that you do first thing on awakening.” Cameron herself has diligently practiced it for over 30 years and feels that morning pages act as a potent form of prayer and meditation.

Navigating creative blocks and the age of digital distraction

But in this era of digital disruption, how does one maintain a consistent creative practice amid myriad distractions? For Cameron, it boils down to desire. “When you desire a creative practice, you make it a priority,” she observes.

In today’s landscape, the rise of artificial intelligence presents a unique challenge for writers and artists. When queried about AI’s role in the creative world, and its potential to rehash writers’ work, Cameron stresses the value of originality. “We are the origin of our work. We have the word original, and it contains the word origin,” she points out.

She also urges artists and writers to always be hopeful about their work and not be consumed by paranoia. Cameron’s long-standing belief in creativity as a spiritual practice remains unwavering, and she sees a deep connection between creativity and mental well-being. She comments, “When people are functioning creatively, they start to be happy. Depression lifts, despair lifts. People find themselves feeling a sense of hope, a sense of optimism, a sense of enthusiasm. And all of these things are earmarks of mental health.”

Hence her work has managed to withstand the test of time, remaining relevant and thought-provoking for over three decades. Souvenir Press recently seized “Living the Artist’s Way: An Intuitive Path to Creativity,” a new book by the author. As we head into National Authors Day and National Writing Month, Cameron’s words serve as a gentle reminder of the timeless essence of creativity and the importance of preserving it.
