"And Quiet Flows the Don," 1958; director – Sergey Gerasimov

Trying to escape from this grim existence and avoid following in her parents' footsteps, Vera is rebelling in every way available to her: she has dollars in her bag (which was illegal at the time), goes to discos and gets involved in a brawl with the police. That is where she meets a student, Sergei, and they fall in love. However, the girl's brother and parents are opposed to the match.
