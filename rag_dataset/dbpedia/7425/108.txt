Wacking games are a way of life in redemption centers and it's a pretty good bet that they always will be -- so if you're going to whack something, why not whack a mean looking Shark with ICE Inc's fantastic Hammer Head game. An attractive piece, and fun game to play, Hammerhead offers operators a game that's going to earn solidly for years to come -- at a very affordable price.

Don't know how much more you could ask of a game, but if you do want more, this guy has been engineered to withstand just about anything short of a missile attack, is fully operator adjustable, and comes in a nice small footprint that makes it simple to place. Room for one of these in every redemption location !!!
