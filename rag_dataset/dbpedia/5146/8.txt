Francisco "Pancho Chinchillo" GARZA671,980,2248,2252 was born on 21 July 1886 in Rancho "Las Animas", Willacy County, Texas.2248 At the time, Rancho Las Animas was in Cameron County. He died on 15 August 1974 at the age of 88.2248 He was buried in Rancho "Las Cuatas", Encino, Texas.2248 Francisco Garza was widely known as Pancho Chinchillo, most people who knew him well say, because of his outstanding riding ability on a horse. Hardly anything could knock him off a horse and he could break most any wild horse. People would say he was like a chinche (bedbug) attaching itself to one's skin. He was also small in stature and thus he was like a small bedbug, hence "chinchillo". Pancho being a nickname for his given name of Francisco, he became known as Pancho Chinchillo.

He was an excellent horseman and cowhand and worked at several of the large ranches in South Texas, including the King Ranch, the McAllen Ranch, the East Ranch, the El Salado Ranch, and others. He was also known to be a "tequilero" or tequila smuggler during the Prohibition era, smuggling tequila and mescal from Mexico and hauling it north into Falfurrias and other nearby towns. There is a photo of him being arrested by custom inspectors on page 509 of the book "I Would Rather Sleep in Texas", by Mary Margaret McAllen Amberson, James A. McAllen and Margaret H. McAllen, descendants of the founder of the McAllen Ranch and the namesake for the city of McAllen, Texas.
