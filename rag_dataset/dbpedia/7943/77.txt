Combining a savvy blend of alternative rock, contemporary pop, and classic singer/songwriter influences, American band OneRepublic are one of the most commercially successful acts of their generation. Bolstered by the anthemic songwriting of frontman Ryan Tedder -- who has earned Grammys writing for an extensive roster of high-profile talent including Leona Lewis, Beyonc√©, Maroon 5, Taylor Swift, and Adele -- they broke through with the Timbaland remix of "Apologize" from their 2006 debut, Dreaming Out Loud.

From there, OneRepublic continued to rack up radio hits. They reached a peak with 2013's Native, which was home to the hit singles "Counting Stars" and "Love Runs Out." While Tedder continued to push the band's sound, embracing electronic dance and pop flourishes, OneRepublic retained their chart influence, hitting number three on the Billboard 200 with 2016's Oh My My and number 11 with 2021's Human. In 2022, they scored a Top 40 hit with "I Ain't Worried," off the Top Gun: Maverick soundtrack, and began rolling out singles for their 2024 album Artificial Paradise.
