After Andrew Bonar Law’s funeral in Westminster Abbey in November 1923, Herbert Asquith observed: ‘It is fitting that we should have buried the Unknown Prime Minister by the side of the Unknown Soldier.’1 Asquith owed Bonar Law no posthumous favours, and intended no ironic compliment, but the remark was a serious underestimate. In post-war politics Alec Douglas-Home is often seen as the Bonar Law of his times, bracketed with his fellow Scot as an interim figure in the history of Downing Street between longer-serving premiers: in Bonar Law’s case, Lloyd George and Stanley Baldwin; in Home’s, Harold Macmillan and Harold Wilson. Both Law and Home were certainly ‘unexpected’ Prime Ministers, but both were also ‘underestimated’, and they made lasting beneficial changes to the political system, on both a national and a party level. The unexpectedness of their accessions to the top of the greasy pole, and the brevity of their premierships (they were the two shortest of the twentieth century: Bonar Law’s one day short of seven months, Alec Douglas-Home’s two days short of a year), are not an accurate indication of their respective significance, even if the precise details of their careers were not always accurately recalled, even by their admirers. The Westminster village is often another world to the general public. Stanley Baldwin was once accosted on a train from Chequers to London, at the height of his fame, by a former school friend. ‘It’s Baldwin, isn’t it?’ he asked.
