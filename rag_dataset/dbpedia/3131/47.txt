Full Name: Andrew Bonar Law

Profession: British Prime Minister

Biography: Bonar Law was a British Conservative politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from October 1922 to May 1923. Despite his relatively brief term, he is notable for being the only Prime Minister to have been born outside the British Isles, in New Brunswick, which was then a British colony in North America.

Prior to his premiership, Law held several important positions in the British government. He was Leader of the Conservative Party twice, first from 1911 to 1921 and then again from 1922 to 1923. This political ascent was marked by his instrumental role in the passing of the Parliament Act 1911 and his staunch opposition to Irish Home Rule, which led to a close alliance with Sir Edward Carson and the Ulster Unionists.

During World War I, he served in Prime Minister David Lloyd George's war cabinet, initially as Chancellor of the Exchequer and later as Leader of the House of Commons. His tenure as Prime Minister came at a turbulent time in British politics, with the country facing significant economic challenges and political divisions in the aftermath of the war.

Law's term as Prime Minister ended abruptly due to his declining health. He was diagnosed with throat cancer and resigned in May 1923. He passed away later that year.
