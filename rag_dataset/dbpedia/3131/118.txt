At the turn of the twentieth century, Andrew Law was elected to the British Parliament. In 1911, he became head of the Conservative Party and after the outbreak of the Great War formed a coalition government with Herbert Asquith.

After the 1916 election, that brought in the government of David Lloyd George, Bonar Law was appointed to the higher position of Chancellor of the Exchequer. Bonar Law became Prime Minister of Great Britain, briefly and reluctantly, from October 1922 to May 1923, after Lloyd Georges tenure. Andrew Law later died in October 1923.
