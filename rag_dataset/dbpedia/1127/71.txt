80s alt country punk outfit, Lone Justice, with Maria McKee, Ryan Hedgecock, Marvin Etzoni are in full flight with the release of a brand new 7”.

Taken from their forthcoming album, ‘Teenage Kicks’ is a rambunctious slice of punk angst that was recorded in one take. It’s a timeless anthem with a joyous riff that explodes into a hail of feedback.

A favour returned as the songwriter of Feargal Sharkey’s only solo hit ‘A Good Heart’, Lone Justice cover The Undertones’ Peel-approved favourite with the artwork being a nod to the original.

“As much as we loved Merle Haggard, George Jones, and many other authentic hard core Country artists, we were also deeply impacted by Punk; from the Velvet Underground (we were playing “Sweet Jane” live as early as 1983) to the MC5 (“Sister Ann” is on the album “Viva Lone Justice”).”

Backed with ‘Nothing Can Stop My Loving You’ that’s cut with a wild, squeezebox-powered interpretation of the George Jones and Roger Miller country stomp.

“Speaking of George Jones, here’s one written by George Jones and Roger Miller. Two of our favorites! We played this song at nearly every show starting in 1983. This ragged and right live recording captures the fire from a sold out show at The Palace in Los Angeles and features Jo-El Sonnier on lead accordion documenting the only time Sonnier played with LJ. “Nothing Can Stop My Loving You” is the only live track on the album”
