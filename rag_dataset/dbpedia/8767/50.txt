WASHINGTON DC (WFSB) - A delegation of over 100 Connecticut pizza makers, veterans, and community leaders flew to Washington DC on Wednesday to declare New Haven the “Pizza Capital of the United States.”

Rep. Rosa DeLauro made the declaration into Congressional Record.

“New Haven has the best pizza in the country and it is not even close,” DeLauro said. “Ask anyone from Connecticut and they will tell you Connecticut pizza, or ‘apizza’ as we call it, is hands down, no contest, the best pizza in America.”

DeLauro said she looked forward to dropping the hammer on the debate.

“Our local pizzerias are local, national, and international destinations, and New Haven-style pizzerias are being established and shipping their pizza products all over the globe,” said New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker. “However, there’s nothing like going to the actual source. I encourage everyone to come to visit New Haven and enjoy our pizza, and all that our city has to offer.”

The so-called Connecticut Pizza Delegation flew to DC from Tweed-New Haven Airport by way of Avelo Airlines.

It consisted of representatives from Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana, Sally’s Apizza, Modern Apizza, Pizza at The Brick Oven, Next Door, Big Green Truck Pizza, BAR, Est Est Est Pizza, and Cast Iron Chef Chop House. The event was organized by pizza guru and Taste of New Haven Founder Colin M. Caplan.

After arriving in the nation’s capital, the delegation had lunch at Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana’s Alexandria, VA location and attended a presentation and celebration of the Congressional Record Statement on the steps of the U.S. Capitol with DeLauro. The delegation ended the day with a visit to the Vietnam Memorial before it headed back to Dulles for the flight back to New Haven.
