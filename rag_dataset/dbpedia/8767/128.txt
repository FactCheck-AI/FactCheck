Haven Cashwell is currently pursuing her PhD in Geography under the advisement of Dr. Karen McNeal. Her thesis research involves eye-tracking a decision support system, including how climate change will impact certain species, in order to benefit United States Fish and Wildlife Service biologists to incorporate climate information when they are completing Species Status Assessments. She is from Marshallberg, North Carolina and graduated with a B.S. in Meteorology and a minor in Environmental Science from North Carolina State University. Her general interests are fishing off the coast of North Carolina, boating in the Core Sound, and traveling to new places.

“I am excited to be a part of this project because being from a coastal town has really shown me the importance of climate resiliency. I hope that my future research will be beneficial to areas like my hometown of Marshallberg.”
