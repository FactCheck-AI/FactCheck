Midfielder happy with life at Bundesliga club.

Check in to Greuther Furth vs Borussia Dortmund

Borussia Dortmund’s Ilkay Gundogan has denied speculation linking him with a move away from the club according to Tutto Mercato Web.

The midfielder has been in fine form for the German side this season and has played an integral role in his side’s successful Champions League campaign.

Dortmund currently find themselves in a strong position in the Champions League. They recently achieved a 0-0 draw away at Malaga during their Champions League quarter final first leg tie, leaving them well placed to progress to the semi-finals.

Gundogan’s performances have not gone unnoticed with a number of top European sides reportedly monitoring the player’s availability.

Real Madrid are thought to be considering a summer bid for the player. The Spanish giants consider Gundogan as one of their top summer targets with Xabi Alonso’s future at the club remaining uncertain.

Alonso has yet to put pen to paper on a new deal and the Real Madrid hierarchy have reportedly identified Gundogan as the perfect replacement for Alonso should the Spanish midfielder decide to leave the club.

But Gundogan has poured cold water on speculation linking him with a move away from the club insisting he would prefer to renew his contract with Dortmund.
