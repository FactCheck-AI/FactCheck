This movie is really a little gem. I need a little effort to defend this argument. It's enough to remember that it is directed by Mario Monicelli, the GREAT director (La Grande Guerra, I soliti Ignoti, Guardie e Ladri, L'Armata Brancaleone and many others), and that it won seven David di Donatello, an important Italian movie award, including best movie and best director.

The cast is also incredible, as it groups together so many European icons: from Sweden Liv Ullman (the protagonist of many Ingmar Bergman movies); from France, the beautiful Catherine Deneuve, and the wonderful actors Philippe Noiret and Bernard Blier; from Italy the divine Stefania Sandrelli, always beautiful and realistic, and the already very very good actress Athina Cenci.

After the cynic "Parenti serpenti", Monicelli again films a portrait of another Italian family. There is not a real protagonist in this movie, the protagonist is the family. There is a lot of fun, but also some thoughtful moments, as always in Monicelli's movies. All the males in this movie end up revealing their egoistic nature or stupidity. A concept that the Italian Comedy of 50s and 60s (which Monicelli belonged to) already expressed and elaborated extensively. The difference here is that there is hope, and this hope resides in women.

I don't want to say that this is a movie just for women. It's fun, it's serious, and it does a very nice homage to women and sisterhood.

I say don't miss this movie, males and females, I am sure you won't regret it.
