EDITORS COMMENTS

This print showcases Maurice Barres, a prominent French novelist, journalist, and socialist politician of the early 20th century. The copy was skillfully created by Boris Mestchersky in 1957, capturing the essence of Barres' profile and half-length figure as he sits in contemplation. This illustration is derived from Histoire de la Nation Francaise, Sciences, Volumes I & II by Gabriel Hanotaux. Barres (1862-1923) was known for his nationalist views and his significant contributions to literature. His works explored themes of identity, patriotism, and cultural heritage. As an influential writer during his time, Barres left a lasting impact on French society. The lithograph itself was masterfully executed by Jacques-Emile Blanche (1861-1942), who expertly captured the details of Barres' features with precision and finesse. This particular print belongs to a private collection but is available for public viewing. Through this image, we catch a glimpse into the world of Maurice Barres - an intellectual powerhouse whose writings continue to inspire readers today.
