The Tilburg student band Krezip became incredibly popular in the summer of 2000. The foundation for the success was laid with a series of energetic performances on the club circuit; the general public was subsequently reached with the melodic piano ballad I Would Stay. Their debut album Nothing Less eventually reached platinum status. After that it became quiet around the band for a long time. Singerâ€¦ and figurehead Jacqueline Govaerts in particular had to contend with health problems (lumps on the vocal cords) and a real 'writer's block'. Moreover, several members of the band were busy with their studies at the Tilburg Rock Academy. Two years after the breakthrough comes the successor Days Like This. The album shows a band that has grown in every way. The naive charm of their first record gives way to a mature and confident 'alternative rock' sound, which also includes the most recent developments in nu-metal and stoner rock. Once again, the talented singer Jacqueline Govaerts makes the most impression, who sings every song or her life depends on it. (MS)more
