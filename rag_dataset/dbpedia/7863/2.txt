"Take Me Home, Country Roads" is such an iconic song written and sung by the legendary John Denver. Recently, a video surfaced of this song performed by not only Denver himself but also Johnny Cash. Two very different voices singing this beloved song is something very special indeed.

This once in a lifetime event was possibly filmed for a 1977 John Denver television special called "Thank God I'm a Country Boy."

What you may not know is that the song was originally written for Johnny Cash to perform. However, upon reflection, Denver decided he liked the song so much that he wanted to record it himself!
