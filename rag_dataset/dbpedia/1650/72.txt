Time has run out for CBS’ science-based drama. Based on a British series of the same name, the network has cancelled Eleventh Hour after 18 episodes.

Eleventh Hour revolves around a team of scientists and FBI agents who work to solve strange crimes that involve science and possible paranormal activity. The drama stars Rufus Sewell, Marley Shelton, and Omar B. Miller.

Debuting on October 9, 2008, the show started out with an audience of 11.37 million viewers and a 3.2/9 rating/share of the 18-49 demographic. The season ended up averaging about 12 million. While that looks fine on its own, the series consistently lost a large percentage of its CSI lead-in.

The show’s been “on the bubble” for awhile and now, the network has decided to cancel it. All of the show’s episodes have aired and there’s been no word on a DVD release.
