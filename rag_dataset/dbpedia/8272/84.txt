What is Ian McShane’s American Star about?

“An assassin (Ian McShane) on final assignment arrives in Fuerteventura to kill a man he has never met,” the official synopsis reads. “But when the target is delayed, instead of following protocol he stays; drawn to the island, the people, and a ghostly shipwreck. When the target returns, the world has shifted. Before everything was simple- now nothing is.”

American Star is directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego, who is best known for making the found-footage science fiction horror film Apollo 18, starring Warren Christie and Lloyd Owen, in 2011. He also directed 2003’s Sobre el arco iris, 2013’s Open Grave, 2016’s The Hollow Point, and 2019’s Backdraft 2.

Along with McShane, American Star stars Nora Arnezeder (Army of the Dead, Safe House), Adam Nagaitis (The Terror, The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon), Fanny Ardant (The Young Lovers), and Thomas Kretschmann (Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Gran Turismo).

With a screenplay written by Nacho Faerna, American Star is produced by McShane and Michael Elliot. Executive producers include Peter Hampden, Pedro Hernández Santos, Phil Hunt, Evangelo Kioussis, Norman Merry, Jim Mooney, Compton Ross, and Walli Ullah.

American Star opens in United States theaters on January 26, 2024, from IFC Films.
