IFC Films has released a trailer for an assassin thriller titled American Star. The film stars Ian McShane as an assassin who finds himself embarking on his final mission.

In the film, the assassin arrives in Fuerteventura “to kill a man he has never met. But the target is delayed. Instead of following protocol he stays, drawn to the island, the people and a ghostly shipwreck. When the target returns, the world has shifted. Before everything was simple, now nothing is.”

The movie was directed by Gonzalo López-Gallego and while it’s not a unique story, it looks like a decent film. The movie is set to be released in select theaters and on VOD sometime in early 2024.
