There, he is commissioned to kill a man he has never met. However, when his target’s arrival is delayed, he finds himself enjoying the tropical surroundings and becoming involved with a woman who he meets there, which complicates his entire mission.

Here’s the synopsis:

Seasoned assassin Wilson (Ian McShane) is on final assignment in the island of Fuerteventura to kill a man he has never met. But the target is delayed, and Wilson’s plans must change. Instead of following protocol and returning to London, Wilson decides to stay on the island. It’s been a long time since he’s had a vacation. When his target finally returns, Wilson is there waiting for him in his house, as he had been a few days earlier. But in this brief time, everything has changed. He came to kill a man who he had never laid eyes on. That was easy. Now, nothing will be.
