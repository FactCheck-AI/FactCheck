Orthodox Jewish musician

Musical artist

Yosi Piamenta (Hebrew: יוסי פיאמנטה; 29 November 1951 – 23 August 2015) was an Orthodox Jewish singer-songwriter and guitarist, known for introducing the electric guitar to Jewish music.[1][2] Piamenta played rock and roll tunes, often infused with heavy rock licks and extended guitar solos – all while dressed in Orthodox Jewish religious clothing and singing Biblical Hebrew lyrics.[3] Piamenta was widely acknowledged by rock critics as a guitar virtuoso.[3]

In addition to being an original songwriter, Piamenta covered others' music in the religious Jewish music category – his album Songs of the Rebbes includes various Lubavitch, Belz, and Sephardi nigunim and zemirot[4] – as well as secular American music, such as Eric Clapton,[4] Carlos Santana,[5][6] and Jimi Hendrix.[7] Piamenta described his music style saying, "I do klezmer with electric guitar".[7]

Personal life

Piamenta was born in Jerusalem in 1951 to Yehuda and Genia Piamenta.[8] In 1962, when he was 12 years old, Piamenta moved with his family to Tel Aviv. There, he received his first guitar from his uncle, Albert Piamenta, an Israeli saxophonist.[7][9] Growing up, he practiced traditional Judaism.[9]

In his 20s, Piamenta moved to New York together with his brother, Avi Piamenta, with the intention of working on a joint album with American saxophone player Stan Getz.[9] The album was a success, but Piamenta disapproved of the entertainment industry lifestyle and turned to religion, joining the Orthodox Jewish community.[10] He married his 16-year-old cousin, Vivian, and they raised six children together; the couple separated in 2005.[7]

Piamenta lived in Flatbush, Brooklyn, for over 20 years before moving back to Israel to reside near his father.[8] Piamenta said that he moved back to Israel permanently. He said, "My father, who is 80, called me in New York and said, 'Come back to Israel, be with me a little'. He never talked in that tone before, and I decided to come back. All my life I have played and made music and I won't stop. Now I will play in Israel and form a band and go abroad for gigs wherever I am invited. My base from today on is Tel Aviv".[11] His father, Yehuda, has since died.[8]

In August 2014, Piamenta, together with Avi Piamenta and Naftali Kalfa, released a single, "Yaancha," calling it a "prayer for Piamenta's recovery".[12] On 14 April 2015, Piamenta's Facebook page disclosed that "Yosi is not doing well" and asked fans to "Please pray your hearts out".[13] On 17 April 2015 Piamenta fell into a coma; he woke up from the coma two days later.[14] Piamenta underwent surgery for cancer at the Sheba Medical Center.[15] He died in New York on 23 August 2015.[1]

Musical career

In 1974, Piamenta formed a band with his brother Avi, a flutist. By 1976, the brothers had been discovered by Getz, who invited them to record with him in New York.[16] Piamenta was 26 years old when he arrived in New York and embarked on a tour with Getz throughout the United States.[16] After the tour, the Piamentas joined Getz on tour in Israel.[16] After recording an album with Getz, Piamenta became a baal teshuva (observant Orthodox Jew).[7][16]

Piamenta's fan base was bifurcated. A majority appreciated him as an iconic Jewish musician and attended his live performances at religious events and Jewish concerts and weddings. Piamenta also attracted a fan base that particularly enjoyed his interpretations of rock and blues, and his lengthy guitar solos that he usually played only at smaller concerts held in bars and clubs.[16]

In addition to his live performances, Piamenta released a series of studio albums that can be found in Jewish homes in the US and Israel.[16] The Piamenta Band was one of the most-requested groups of musicians for Jewish weddings for many years.[17] Most of Piamenta's concerts and albums were performed or recorded in conjunction with his brother, Avi.[citation needed]
