Easily one of the most pointless remakes in recent movie history. They did a brilliant job of replicating it perfectly... minus the jokes.

*sigh* What a waste of money, talent and time.

Bankable black talents fill up Death at a Funeral, a comedy ensemble taking place at a familyâ€™s paternal funeral. From Chris Rock, Zoe Saldana, Martin Lawrence, Regina Hall and Peter Dinklage, the comedic bursts work for better or worse. The performances are showcases of these starsâ€™ talents, sadly wasted by the poor script.

The plot and setting limits the laugh down to a ridiculous comedy of errors approach. Death at a Funeral is too talkative, yet the conversations are empty and non stimulating; unable to rise above the clichÃ©s Rock and producers are used to. Poo jokes? Really? How old do you think the viewers are? 10 year olds? Overall, this Neil LaBute film is an outlandish watch youâ€™d forget once its over.

Plus half a star for James Mardsenâ€™s nakedness ðŸ¥µ
