Upgrade your concert experience with a pre-show party. For $30, in addition to a concert ticket purchase, concert-goers are given access to an exclusive Pre-Show party which includes a food bar, entertainment and giveaways (drinks available for purchase). Party attendees will be allowed early entry to the concert** and will enter the venue from the party tent area. Limited tickets are available. Fair will include (1) parking permit with each party ticket for all party tickets purchased through July 15th. Parking permit will be a dated parking ticket, for Infield Lot 18, that can be used day of party event only. In-person sales will receive parking permit at time of purchase. Fair will mail permits for all box office phone orders or Ticketmaster (online/mobile) purchases to Purchaser at address listed per order details. Fair will not be held responsible for any mail delivery issues. Purchases made on or after July 15th will not be eligible for the free parking permit inclusion with purchase.

Party tent is located near the south end of the Grandstand Stage. The Pre-Show Party is open for 1 ½ hours only – please check ticket for party hours. Party closes 1 hour prior to concert start time. Party purchase is only available to those who have purchased a concert ticket to attend that evening's concert (concert ticket is NOT included with party ticket purchase). BOTH a concert and party ticket will be required to scan in for entrance to the party tent.

*Note – Entrance to party tent is allowed only from party start time to party closing time. There will be no entry into or through the party tent area once it has closed. Any party ticket holder that did not arrive prior to party tent closing, will be required to enter the concert venue through the Grandstand Gate shown on their concert ticket. All attendees of the party will be required to enter into the venue when the party closes.

**Early entry refers to attendees entering the venue prior to other regular ticketholders. If Artist is offering any type of their own VIP packaging for the event (which may include first entry), party attendees will enter after any such VIP package ticket holder, but before any regular ticketholders.

Though many online ticket brokers may imply that they are an official website for ticket purchases for our events, only Ticketmaster and their website www.Ticketmaster.com are official online ticket purchase points for the Illinois State Fair concerts and events. We cannot guarantee that tickets purchased from other sources are legitimate. We will not be able to assist you if there is a problem with tickets purchased from such companies.
