“NFL Network needed a tool to play out multiple LED video walls, tickers, and projections on our stage at the same time. In a live fast-paced environment, the tool needed to be easy to use while handling the complex graphical operations for our shows.” Patrick Lee

Director, Real-Time Systems

“With an archive of historic value, and many partners needing instant access, Viz One and AWS was the only clear choice. It provides us with the confidence we demand from our technology stack to protect our archive and meets the flexibility and access demands of our internal teams and external partners.” Michael Raimondo

VP of Broadcast Technology, PGA TOUR

“Since we implemented Viz Multiplay, everything has become much simpler. It has an extremely simple and highly illustrative interface, yet it provides you with a complete view of what the set is like. We have a complete overview of what the set is, and on a operation level it makes it very easy for us to control everything.” Javier Coulouscou
