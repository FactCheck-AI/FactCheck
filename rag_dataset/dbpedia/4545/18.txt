In Memoriam: Dr. William Dawes

Our esteemed colleague and Emeritus Associate Professor of Economics, William S. Dawes (Bill) passed away on May 1st, 2023. Bill was a faculty member in our department from 1969 until 2016 when he retired. He then held a Toll Professorship for three years. To our community, he was a colleague, a mentor, a teacher, and a friend.

In November of 2010 an Excellence Fund was set up with his name by his alumni, The William Dawes Fund for Excellence. The proceeds of this fund are distributed to our departmental yearly awards for teaching and research excellence by our graduate students. His wife Alice asks that in-lieu of flowers, donations to the Fund that bears his name be made.
