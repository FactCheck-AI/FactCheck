What was on the ballot?

In Lubbock County, voters will decide whether the county can issue $35.5 million in bonds to fund a proposed new medical examiner's office.

If approved by Lubbock County voters, the $35.5 million in bond-supported funds would be used along with $10 million in federal ARPA (American Rescue Plan Act) funding previously approved for allocation by the county to pay for what would be an approximately $45 million project to re-establish an in-house medical examiner's office in the county, according to previous reporting.

The bond proposal would add about 3/4 of a cent per $100 valuation onto the Lubbock County property tax rate. That would amount to about $15 more per year on a $200,000 home, the Avalanche-Journal previously reported.
