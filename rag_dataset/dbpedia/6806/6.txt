About Dada Saheb Phalke Award

The Dada Saheb Phalke Prize is India’s top film award, awarded yearly during the National Film Awards event by the Directorate of Film Festivals, an organization established by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Devika Rani was the inaugural recipient of this award, which she got at the 17th National Film Awards in 1969.

Dadasaheb Phalke is often regarded as the “Father of Indian Cinema.” In 1913, he directed India’s first full-length feature film, Raja Harishchandra. As a result, the Government of India established the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1969 to honor Dadasaheb Phalke.

The honorees have been recognized for their “great contribution to the growth and development of Indian film.” A group of distinguished figures from the Indian cinema industry selects the recipients of the Dadasaheb Phalke award. The reward includes a Swarna Kamal (Golden Lotus) medallion, a shawl, and a Rs. 10 lakh cash prize.
