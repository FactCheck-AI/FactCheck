Leeds-based PR and social media specialist agency, Prohibition, has won a major social media brief from Northumbria University, that will see it developing a group-wide social media strategy for the multicultural learning community.

Northumbria University which is based in Newcastle upon Tyne, gained University status in 1992, and has since grown significantly, now boasting more than 30,000 students and 500 study programmes, across its two campuses.

The appointment – which was made after a competitive tender – forms part of Northumbria’s multi-million-pound commitment towards becoming a top 30 UK university by 2018, that will see it build its global reputation and revenue streams, as well as strengthen its operational efficiency and effectiveness.

Prohibition’s activity will span a number of distinct phases, including a thorough analysis of the University’s current social media activities, which, including academics, partners and individual departments, currently number more than 200 channels, as well as understanding the narratives surrounding the establishment.

The brief’s final phase will see Prohibition developing a university-wide social media strategy, which it will then deliver through a series of workshops and face-to-face training sessions with key stakeholders.

Will Ockenden, Director at Prohibition, said: “This brief is fascinating and wide in scope, in part due to the sheer number and diversity of stakeholders involved with the University’s social media efforts, either in an official, or un-official capacity. One of our key challenges is therefore to establish a strategic framework that gives the University an element of control and visibility, while also encouraging and nurturing the ‘grass roots’ conversations that are already doing such a good job of advocating the student experience. This brief – with its complexity and multi-faceted digital demands – is a perfect fit for Prohibition.”
