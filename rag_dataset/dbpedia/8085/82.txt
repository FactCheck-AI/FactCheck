By: Allen Kurzweil

Winner: Best Fact Crime 2016

Available on Overdrive

The true account of one man’s lifelong search for his boarding-school bully. Equal parts childhood memoir and literary thriller, Whipping Boy chronicles Allen Kurzweil’s search for his twelve-year-old nemesis, a bully named Cesar Augustus. While tracking down his tormentor, the author encounters an improbable cast of characters that includes an elocution teacher with ill-fitting dentures, a gang of faux-royal swindlers, a crime investigator with “paper in his blood,” and a monocled grand master of the Knights of Malta. Yet for all its global exoticism and comic exuberance, Kurzweil’s riveting account is, at its core, a heartfelt and suspenseful narrative about the “parallel lives” of a victim and his abuser.
