Captain Billy Gordon chose to bat after winning the toss and saw Frankie Jacobs put on 63 with Jamie Sorell, who fell two runs short of his half-century to make it 72-2.

Gordon (52) then put on 97 with Ronnie Saunders (66) before the home side lost late wickets to close on 211-7 from 64 overs.

It proved more than enough as Mehad Khan removed Hadleighâ€™s top three to leave the visitors 35-3, before former England Test spinner Panesar took centre stage.

After bowling Sam Handley, the left-armer had Luke Smith caught by Jacobs and trapped Adam Dobson and Adam Soilleux lbw to leave Hadleigh 65-7.

Panesar completed his five-wicket haul by bowling Ashley Bennett for a duck soon after, then had Haider Ali Syed Zaidi stumped by Michael Bones to finish with 6-22, before Khan (4-26) completed an emphatic 124-run win.
