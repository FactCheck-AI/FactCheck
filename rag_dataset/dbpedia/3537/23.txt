Vertigo Films has released a preview clip from the new documentary Hawking exclusively through Digital Spy.

Jim Carrey, one of the film's contributors alongside Buzz Aldrin, Richard Branson and Benedict Cumberbatch, discusses Stephen Hawking's sense of humour and working with him for talk show skits in the video.

"He's willing to teach people in whatever way he has to teach people," Carrey said. "You can't take yourself too seriously no matter how intelligent you are or how important the work you're doing is."

BAFTA-winning director Stephen Finnigan is behind the camera for Hawking, which celebrates the theoretical physicist's life and offers viewers unprecedented access.

Hawking will premiere at the Cambridge Film Festival with a live Q&A by Stephen Hawking on September 19 before heading to UK cinemas on September 20.
