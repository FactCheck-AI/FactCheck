Our Journey Begins: The Founding of TechTrone

In 2017, after dedicating 17 enriching years to the corporate world, working globally with large enterprises and managing millions of dollars in IT assets, we embarked on a new journey with TechTrone. This decision was born from our firsthand observations of the pressing IT needs faced by small businesses in Long Island. Leveraging our vast certifications from industry leaders like Microsoft, Cisco, EC-Council, ITIL, and ISC2, and building upon our more than two decades of experience in managing complex networks for significant enterprises, TechTrone quickly transcended its initial purpose. For us, TechTrone isn’t just a company; it’s our mission. We are deeply committed to eliminating the technology gap that small businesses encounter, ensuring their futures are secure from the digital threats that are all too common in today’s world.

Filling the IT Gap - Our Core Value

TechTrone identified a significant void in the technological landscape: small businesses throughout Long Island found themselves grappling with a host of technological hurdles. The dire consequences of ransomware attacks, the risks associated with inadequate backup systems, and the prohibitive expense of tech services preventing the engagement of professionals, transformed these issues from mere challenges to existential threats. At its core, TechTrone was established on the belief that every small enterprise is entitled to affordable IT solutions that do not sacrifice security or efficiency. This guiding principle represents more than just a commitment; it’s a vow to safeguard, strengthen, and enhance the digital backbone of small businesses.

Today's Triumphs: TechTrone as Long Island's SMB Backbone

Since its inception, TechTrone has far exceeded its initial promises, soaring to new heights of achievement. With a portfolio of over 4000 projects, the company now stands as the cornerstone for more than 350 SMBs across Long Island, symbolizing the trust, dependability, and excellence that define TechTrone. However, it’s not merely technical skill that distinguishes TechTrone; it’s the firm’s unwavering commitment to perfection on the first try. Taking the time to deeply comprehend the distinct needs of each client, TechTrone crafts not just solutions, but strategic roadmaps to success, ensuring a tailored approach to each challenge.

Our Goal

At the heart of TechTrone’s philosophy is the belief in building enduring professional relationships. It’s not just about providing a service; it’s about becoming a partner, a member of the family, ensuring that clients’ technological needs are met today, tomorrow, and in the years to come. This commitment to lasting relationships is more than just a business strategy; it’s a reflection of the company’s deep-rooted belief in the power of community, support, and mutual growth.
