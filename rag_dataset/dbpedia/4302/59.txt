Hana began working on music in 2006, with the help of producers and writers Ben Moody and Michael "Fish" Herring.[5] Her early work was largely acoustic-based,[6] heavily utilizing her performance on the guitar.[7] During this period, she recorded under her birth name Hana Pestle.[8] She released three extended plays—Hana Pestle (2008),[9] Live in the Studio (2009),[10] and For the Sky (2011)[11]—and her debut studio album, This Way (2009).[12]

In 2013, upon meeting producer BloodPop, Hana chose to take a break from recording to focus on learning production. Dissatisfied with her output, she decided to rebrand herself and change the direction of her music. In 2015, she re-emerged with the single "Clay", changing her recording name to the mononym Hana. Her eponymous debut extended play (2016) under this moniker explored an electronic style.[13] In November 2019, Hana released her second studio album, Hanadriel. The album was made in four weeks, and the creation process was live streamed by herself on Twitch.[14]
