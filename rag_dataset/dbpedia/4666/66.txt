YELLOW SPRINGS, Ohio (WKEF/WRGT)- Antioch College is working on the final steps to make WYSO an independent public radio station serving southwest Ohio.

The station is owned and operated by the college, and was founded more than 6 decades ago. Now, they plan to assign the FCC public radio broadcast license to a newly formed nonprofit with its own independent governance board.

The college will get $3.5 million as partial reimbursement for investment into the radio station. The station will begin operations as a stand-alone once all he necessary funds have been raised, which is expected to be no later than March 31.

"All at the college are enormously proud of WYSO and some may worry about this change," college president Tom Manley said. "But a holistic, practice-based college education and public radio broadcasting are not the same things, obviously. The assignment of the license permits both organizations to pursue their respective missions, while continuing to maintain the very strategic partnership they have nurtured."

The two will continue to work together though The Center for Community Voices, which is a media training center developed by WYSO in 2010, which will help students and members of the community create radio stories and earn 21st century media literacy skills required for effective storytelling on digital platforms.
