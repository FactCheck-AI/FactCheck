Suggestion for after Basel: Take the train to Zurich – 1 hour direct:

Zurich

Ranked among the world’s top cities in terms of quality of life, Switzerland’s capital of finance has plenty to offer the visiting tourist. With its exuberant popular culture, vibrant arts scene and lakeside setting you won’t be disappointed.

The Old Town, Zurich’s medieval heart, runs along the Limaat river and has lots of pretty little shops and cafés. Very different architecture from in Geneva. Just strolling through the streets and sitting by the lake or the river is a pleasure in itself. Check out the Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich’s most upmarket shopping street.

Zurich Old Town

The Swiss National Museum is right next to the train station and has a very rich historical collection, well worth a visit. https://www.landesmuseum.ch/en

The Kunsthaus, Switzerlands greatest art gallery, offers attractive exhibitions of international scope and one of the largest art collections in Switzerland, with works from the 13th century to the present day. With some 19,000 members, its patron association, the Zürcher Kunstgesellschaft, is one of the largest of its kind in Europe.

http://www.kunsthaus.ch/en/

And of course, there are many beautiful historic buildings which are free to enter, such as the Romanesque cathedral, the Grossmünster.

Zurich’s also a younger town than Geneva, with two universities, and has nightlife to match. The main areas are the Langstrasse, and Zurich West. Within the Old Town, it’s more expensive and more traditional. If you want to try one of the typical beer-cellars, the Zeughauskeller on Paradeplatz is a good venue for your beer and sausage fix!

The Lugano resort is the region’s principle town and well worth a visit with its appealing Italianate culture and architecture. You can also take a cruise on the lake which is one of the regions most beautiful natural features. https://www.lakelugano.ch/en

The second lake of the region is Lac Maggiore with Locarno, another popular resort. Most of the lake is in Italy and it is much larger than Lugano. In Locarno you can hire a boat and enjoy a fun trip on the lake, or take the funicular train up to the Madonna del Sasso church. Also, check out the Piazza Grande!

A bit further along the lake is the pretty village of Ascona – you can take a boat to Italy from here.

If castles are your thing then you should visit Bellinzona. You can do a walk starting with a visit to the Castelgrande, before continuing uphill to two smaller castles. Allow half a day for the trek and you can buy the Bellinzona Pass, which gives entrance to the three Castles of Bellinzona and the civic museum Villa dei Cedri. Approx 30chf.

https://www.bellinzonaevalli.ch/it/inspire-me/experiences/historic-centre-bellinzona.html

Some of the most beautiful scenery is to be found out of the towns – take a bus up to the Val Verzasca where you can hike in specular wild scenery and then cool off in the turquoise mountain streams in the summer. It’s popular to jump in off the bridges, but it is dangerous and you shouldn’t do it.

https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/experiences/a-day-of-adventure-in-the-valle-verzasca/

Here’s another enjoyable attraction if you’re feeling less energetic – Swissminiatur, a tiny version of the most famous places in the country, all in one: https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/swissminiatur-melide.html It’s in the village of Melide and is easy to reach from Lugano with a short train ride, about half an hour.

Also visit the charming villages of Gandria and Morcote on the banks of lake Lugano (15/30 mins bus ride from Lugano).

Bern

The capital of Switzerland and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Bern has the largest old town in Switzerland with some 6 kilometres of picturesque arcades known as the ‘Lauben’. In addition to the many elegant buildings the streets are punctuated with brightly-coloured Renaissance fountains.

As you can see in the top picture the Aare river surrounds the town, and in the summer everyone swims in it:

Bring your swimsuit if you’re visiting in the warm months. Competent swimmers only!

In addition to just strolling around, you must see the parliament building – complete with ice-rink, in the winter, and fountains in the summer, and often a produce market – no guards, you’ll see the members of parliament shopping and skating.

If you can, take a tour visiting-the-parliament-building (only open at certain hours, book before you leave). You can sit in on the debates, as well, and hear how a multilingual country conducts its business.

You should visit the cathedral, the Bernese Minster, which has the highest church spire in all of Switzerland and is one of the most important landmarks of the capital. There are 312 steps to reach the viewing deck – but the wonderful panorama from the Old City to the peaks of the Bernese Oberland is absolutely worth it.

https://www.bern.com/en/detail/the-bern-minster

If you are keen on bears, you’ll want to go to the bear-pit – it’s been here, in one form or another, since the foundation of the town in the 1300’s.

The Historical Museum is very good indeed and has a whole floor devoted to Einstein, one of the city’s most famous residents. https://www.bhm.ch/en/

Einstein’s house is open to visitors as well, though not open in January.

https://www.einstein-bern.ch/index.php?lang=en

Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity was inspired by the famous Clock Tower, the Zytglogge. Be there at midday to hear it striking on the hour and you can book a special tour if you want to see inside.

https://www.bern.com/en/detail/berns-clock-tower-zytglogge

The Kunstmuseum houses over 3000 paintings on three floors from the 14th century to the present. A must for appreciators of fine art .
