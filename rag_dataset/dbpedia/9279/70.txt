DALLAS -- Violinist Michaela Modjeska Paetsch won first prize Sunday in the G.B. Dealey Awards competition for promising young musicians.

Ms. Paetsch, 22, of Colorado Springs, Colo., won the $7,500 cash prize and a solo appearance with the Dallas Symphony during its 1985-86 season.

Cellist Peter Wiley, 28, of Cincinnati was awarded the $4,000 second prize. Cellist Sara Sant'Ambrogio, 21, of St. Louis won the $1,500 third prize.

The Dealey Awards competition was begun in 1931 by George Bannerman Dealey, the late publisher of The Dallas Morning News. It is sponsored by The News in conjunction with, in alternate years, the Dallas Symphony and the Dallas Opera.

This year's 15 semifinalists -- all violinists, violists or cellists - were chosen from 91 contestants from 24 states and six foreign countries. They were selected in regional auditions in Dallas, New York City, Los Angeles and Bloomington, Ind.

Past winners include pianists Van Cliburn, James Dick and Santiago Rodriguez and soprano Kathleen Battle.
