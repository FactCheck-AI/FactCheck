I seem to remember that some time ago someone was collecting information about which engine/propeller combinations everybody was using. Did that data ever get tabulated and if so is the file available here? If not, can anybody suggest an appropriate diameter, pitch, and direction of rotation for the propeller on a CX4?

Mark, it is mostly on if you want a cruise or power prop. Mostly it depends on the horsepower of the engine you select. I have a 2180 73 hp . engine and swing

two different props. One is an Tenn. prop 54X46 (2950 on takeoff) and a Ed Sterba prop 54X44. (3050on takeoff) I believe the guys on the website will be able

to explain it better than I can.

Thank you for the reply Harold. I think I remember from somewhere that the direction of rotation on our Volkswagen engines is opposite to the direction on my Continental C-85 on my Baby Ace. Can anybody confirm that?

Yes, opposite rotation. You will need left rudder on takeoff and climb.

That is very easy to get used to.....almost immediate.

I recommend you talk to your choses prop supplier since pitch numbers vary a LOT for the same physical pitch. I have one prop from Jeff at Props Inc that is pitched at 40 in and it flies the same as my 46 in pitch from Tenn Props. BTW I am sad to say that JEFF RETIRED.

Glen, thanks for your input. I am not absolutely set on a chosen prop provider, but I am leaning toward Culver Props, because she made a prop for my Baby Ace that I like. But I would like to have a little more info before I call her. Is there a specific prop length or diameter that we all agree on?

Yes it does. CCW from the cockpit. You have to push on LEFT rudder on take off.

Hi Glen,

So for take off and climb, is it worth while to offset the leading edge of the fin a little to the right? Or does this make it uncomfortable once at cruise or during descent at a lower power setting?

Thanks for the reply, Doug. I hope you don’t mind if I mention your name when I call Alaina. Do you remember when you got your prop from her, and how long was the lead time between ordering and receiving?

I don’t mind if you use my name as a reference and I think it was about 5 years ago. Delivery as I remember want too bad at the time. They could then check there records to confirm prop size as well.

Guys

I have a 58X32 vw prop...any one know its use? for sale ...Herb

Yes, the fin on the CX5 is offset about 1/2 inch and it helps a lot...with the fin offset you don't need your rudder tab offset very much.

I flew it with no offset for several hundred hours so it is not a big deal but easier if you have trim offset and rudder tab for minor adjustments.

I flew 9 different prop combinations on the CX5 and I use both a Tenn Prop 54/46 and a Props Inc 54/40 ( different pitch calculation). BOTH props fly identically. I get 3250 on takeoff WOT. I cruise 28-3000 rpm./ 21-23 inches MP. That is a good combination climb/ cruise prop I think. If you wanted JUST climb you might want 2 inches less pitch.

FWIW, I fly with a Sterba 54/46 on my 2180. You can check the video to see what happens on TO. I'm usually up in about 700' or so. On the video I have no headwind and a mild crosswind, so I held it on a bit longer, (The orange cone is the 750 mark)

PS, on the big screen TV, even better

Jim, the two canopy side latches you have on your plane, where may I buy a set? Harold

I made my latches from the plans. Dave or someone used to sell them, $35 each
