The first three Devil May Cry games are coming to PlayStation 4, Windows PC and Xbox One in 2018, Capcom announced today. The Devil May Cry HD Collection will include Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 2 and Devil May Cry 3: Dante’s Awakening Special Edition.

Capcom released a similarly titled collection featuring the same three games in 2012 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Based on screenshots released by Capcom (check the gallery below), the 2018 re-release will look similar graphically to that last-generation release.

More recent games in the franchise, Devil May Cry 4 and prequel DmC: Devil May Cry, were re-released for PS4 and Xbox One in 2015. The Devil May Cry HD Collection announcement comes as detailed rumors of a fifth game in the mainline series are in the works.

Capcom’s new Devil May Cry HD Collection will be released March 13, 2018, both digitally and at retail for $29.99.
