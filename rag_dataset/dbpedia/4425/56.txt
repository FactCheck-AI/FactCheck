The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has launched an investigation into the distribution of petrol and diesel on the Western Isles by firm GB Oils.

The company, which trades under the name Scottish Fuels on the isles, is being probed for "suspected abuse of a dominant position in the market".

The OFT said the investigation did not relate to excessive pricing.

It also said the case was at an early stage and did not mean competition law had been broken.

In a statement, the regulator said: "The subject matter of the investigation concerns the contractual arrangements for wholesale supply of road fuels in the Western Isles offered by GB Oils, the rebates paid to filling station customers in the Western Isles by GB Oils and any other payments that may have been made to filling station customers in the Western Isles by GB Oils."
