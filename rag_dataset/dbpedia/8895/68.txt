Drummer Greg Gilmore told Consequence Of Sound: “What I can say right now is that I just watched the video and was struck by how unbelievably fucking great that song is. Ronald Reagan bad. Punk rock good!”

Speaking previously about The Living, McKagan said: “Would this even ever get out of our basement? We had something magical then, and it was ours, so who gives a fuck!”

Gilmore added: “The Living was the beginning of all things Seattle for me — a turning point in my life. I joined a band and a community. These guys are still my brothers. I’ve cherished these recordings since the days we made them. This record is a fantastic document of a loaded moment. I love it.”
