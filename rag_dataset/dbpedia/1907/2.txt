Move it, move it and stop.

Move it, move it and stop.

Move it, move it and stop.

Don't move it so much, stop.

This is the rhythm of my cumbia,

it will make you move it.

This techno-cumbia I'm bringing to you

will give you the pleasure

of moving your body, from

head to toe,

and now we're partying

repeat after me y'all:

Hey (hey), ho (ho), hey (hey)

Don't leave me on my own,

this party is for everybody.

If you're here to dance,

then let's enjoy.

If you're here to sleep,

get out of here,

because my song

is not for the lazy ones,

so if you're still sitting,

throw that chair away.

Dance, dance, don't stop,

there's no time to rest,

this dance is for you,

I wanna see you sweating.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno-Cumbia.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno Techno-Cumbia.

I look around and I notice something:

there are still people

who are not dancing.

Dance, dance, don't stop,

there's no time to rest,

this dance is for you,

I wanna see you sweating.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno-Cumbia.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno Techno-Cumbia.

Look at Juan, he can't even move,

his shoes are so heavy,

I guess there's mud on those shoes.

Look at Maria, she can't move from that chair

that's what you get if you

eat that many tortillas.

Look at Jos√©, he's just sitting there,

he drank a lot of beer,

no he can't even stand straight.

Look at Rosa, she won't get up

because her stockings are torn,

and someone may look.

Move it, move it and stop.

Move it, move it and stop.

Move it, move it and stop.

Don't move it so much, stop.

Dance, dance, don't stop,

there's no time to rest,

this dance is for you,

I wanna see you sweating.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno-Cumbia.

You move it this way,

you move it that way,

this is a new dance,

the Techno Techno-Cumbia.

All right, oh yeah

All right, oh yeah

All right, oh yeah

All right, oh yeah.

Dance, dance, don't stop

this dance is for you.
