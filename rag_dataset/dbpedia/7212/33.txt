TEACH CONTENT IN THE TARGET LANGUAGE TO ENGAGE STUDENTS

All of the lessons below teach and support content in other subject areas.

Readings and activities like these can also be used as evidence for “designing coherent instruction” because they provide scaffolding for later learning. They access students’ prior knowledge about geography, math, science and other subjects. Cross-curricular and varied instruction like this can go a long way to “engaging students in learning”.
