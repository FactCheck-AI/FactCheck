The Battle of Tirad Pass occurred on December 2, 1899, during the Philippine-American War. It is considered a significant event in Philippine history as it marked the heroic last stand of General Gregorio del Pilar and his men against the superior American forces. While primary sources describing the exact events of the battle are scarce, secondary sources and accounts from survivors provide valuable insights. One primary source that gives an account of the battle is a letter written by Colonel Tirso del Rosario, Chief of Staff of the Philippine Revolutionary Army, to General Emilio Aguinaldo. This letter, dated December 19, 1899, provides a detailed report on the battle. Del Rosario states that on December 2, General del Pilar and his men successfully defended a strategic mountain pass against heavy American assault. He describes how Del Pilar led a bayonet charge against the enemy but was killed in action. Another primary source is an article by Pío Valenzuela, a Philippine revolutionary and a close associate of Aguinaldo. Published in the magazine "La Independencia" on February 5, 1900, Valenzuela's article praises del Pilar's heroism and describes the battle as a desperate struggle against overwhelming odds. He mentions how del Pilar displayed exceptional bravery, leading his men in a charge and succumbing to enemy fire. Secondary sources provide additional details about the battle. One such secondary source is the book "A Short History of the Philippines" by Teodoro A. Agoncillo and Oscar M. Alfonso. This book describes how Del Pilar and a small contingent of soldiers defended Tirad Pass against the Americans for several hours before being overwhelmed. It also highlights del Pilar's role in rallying his men and leading the counterattack. Furthermore, the book "The Philippine Revolutionary Army" by José M. A. Cariño describes the battle and presents insights from surviving Philippine soldiers who fought in Tirad Pass. It provides an account of the fierce fighting and the eventual fall of del Pilar. In conclusion, while exact details regarding the Battle of Tirad Pass may vary, primary and secondary sources consistently depict General del Pilar and his men valiantly defending against superior American forces. These various sources provide a unified narrative, highlighting the heroic last stand of the Filipinos and the tragic death of General Gregorio del Pilar.

The Battle of Tirad Pass, also known as the "Battle of Quingua," took place on December 2, 1899, during the Philippine-American War. It involved a small Filipino force under the command of General Gregorio del Pilar defending a mountain pass against a much larger American expeditionary force led by Colonel Peyton C. March. Primary and secondary sources provide various accounts of the specific events of the battle. To support my answer, I will refer to some of these sources: 1. Eyewitness Accounts: a) Letter from General Gregorio del Pilar to General Emilio Aguinaldo (December 5, 1899): In this letter, Del Pilar describes the battle, emphasizing the valor and sacrifice of his soldiers. He mentions that his forces fought fiercely, inflicting heavy casualties on the Americans, but eventually succumbing due to their overwhelming numbers and running out of ammunition. b) Letter from Colonel Peyton C. March to Colonel C.A. Whittier (December 16, 1899): In this letter, March provides his account of the battle, describing the American strategy and the challenges they faced in capturing the pass. He mentions the bravery and tenacity of the Filipino soldiers but ultimately claims victory for the American forces. 2. Secondary Sources: a) Philippine-American War by Glenn Anthony May (1989): May's book provides an extensive overview of the Philippine-American War, including a detailed account of the Battle of Tirad Pass. He mentions the fierce resistance put up by the Filipino defenders, their gallant last stand, and their ultimate defeat at the hands of the American forces. b) The Philippine Revolution and Beyond by Teodoro A. Agoncillo (1992): Agoncillo's book covers the Philippine Revolution and its aftermath, which includes the Philippine-American War. He narrates the Battle of Tirad Pass, focusing on General Gregorio del Pilar and the heroic stand of his troops against the American forces. Combining these primary and secondary sources, it can be concluded that during the Battle of Tirad Pass, General Gregorio del Pilar and his smaller Filipino force fought bravely against the larger American expeditionary force. While inflicting significant casualties on the Americans, the Filipinos eventually succumbed due to their overwhelming numbers and a shortage of ammunition. The battle ended with an American victory.
