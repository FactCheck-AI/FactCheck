HAZARD, Ky. (WYMT) - Police in two Eastern Kentucky counties are sending out an alert to help prevent people from becoming victims of an elaborate scam.

Officials with the Hazard Police Department posted it on Facebook Tuesday.

In the post, they state two men, identified as Dave Slayer and David Fisher, are traveling around the region representing themselves as employees of Publishers Clearing House (PCH). Police say the men are making visits to homes in what they call a PCH van and claiming they have actor Steve Harvey with them.

Knott County Sheriff Dale Richardson said at least two people in his county are victims of the scam.

Police want to remind people if you are ever the winner of a legitimate contest like PCH, you never have to pay money to get money.

Officials from Publishers Clearing House reached out to WYMT by email. Christopher Irving, the Vice President of Consumer and Legal Affairs confirmed that, saying “we never alert our winners ahead of time and NEVER require any money, fee, tax or payment to receive a prize.”

“While we have been lucky enough to have the well-known and respected celebrity Steve Harvey work with us from time to time, he does not currently travel with our Prize Patrol around the country. The use of our good name and brand by imposters is criminal and we work closely with law enforcement around the country to bring these scammers to justice.” Irving said in the email.
