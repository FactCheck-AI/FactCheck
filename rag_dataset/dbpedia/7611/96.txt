What Are the Defenses to Third Degree Assault in Washington?

There are several defenses to third-degree assault that a defendant may use in court. Some of the most common defenses include:

Self-defense: If the defendant was acting in self-defense, they might be able to argue that their actions were justified. In order for this defense to be successful, the defendant must show that they believed they were in imminent danger of harm and that the force they used was reasonable under the circumstances.

Defense of others: Similar to self-defense, a defendant may argue that they were defending another person from harm. Again, the defendant must show that they reasonably believed the other person was in imminent danger of harm and that the force they used was reasonable under the circumstances.

Consent: If the alleged victim consented to the physical contact, the defendant might argue that they did not commit a crime. However, consent is not a defense if the physical contact goes beyond what was agreed upon or if the alleged victim is unable to give valid consent.

Accident: If the defendant did not intend to cause harm and the alleged victim’s injuries were the result of an accident, they may be able to argue that they did not commit a crime. However, successfully using this defense can be difficult if the defendant’s actions are reckless or careless.

Lack of intent: If the defendant did not intend to cause harm to the alleged victim, they might be able to argue that they did not commit third-degree assault. For example, if the alleged victim was accidentally hit while the defendant was swinging their arms around, the defendant may be able to argue that they did not intend to cause harm.

Alibi: If the defendant can prove that they were not at the location where the assault allegedly occurred, they may be able to argue that they did not commit the crime. This defense requires the defendant to provide evidence, such as eyewitness testimony or surveillance footage, that they were somewhere else at the time of the assault.

Mental incapacity: If the defendant was suffering from a mental illness or defect at the time of the assault, they might be able to argue that they lacked the mental capacity to form the intent necessary to commit the crime. However, this defense can be difficult to use successfully and may require the testimony of mental health experts.

Each case is unique, and the success of a defense will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. If you are facing charges of third-degree assault in Washington, it is recommended that you consult with an experienced criminal defense attorney.
