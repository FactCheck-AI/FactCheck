Manila, Philippines.

The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) personnel, officials, and Professional Regulatory Boards (PRBs) already got their first dose of the Covid 19 vaccine. The Central Office and PRC-National Capital Region personnel were vaccinated last May 18-19, 2021 at Dr. Jose Fabella Memorial Hospital, Sta. Cruz, Manila.

The PRC Vaccination Program was made possible through the intercession of Senator Christopher "Bong" Go and with the cooperation of Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III and Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr..

The Office of Sec. Galvez coordinated the overall implementation of the program, by having the DOH Regional Directors link with the PRC Regional Directors regarding the venue and date of the vaccination of PRC personnel. The PRC Covid 19 Task Force provided the masterlist containing names of PRC personnel. A survey was also conducted to determine who among the employees were willing to be vaccinated. Included as priority in the vaccination program were the Chairmen/Chairpersons and Members of various PRBs, majority of whom are senior citizens.

As of June 2, 2021, a total of 743 PRC personnel from the Central and Regional Offices were vaccinated.

The second dose of the vaccine for PRC-NCR, Central Office personnel and PRBs has been set on 17 and 18 June 2021.
