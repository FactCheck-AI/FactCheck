Doug Turner lives in Atlanta, GA with his two cats, several hundred books and a whole lot of woodworking tools. He earned a BFA from The Atlanta College of Art in 1996, and has been designing and building furniture ever since. His interest in marketing, website design and search engine optimization grew from his lack of money to spend on advertising. His belief that the Internet is “The great marketing leveler” has been the foundation of his “guerrilla marketing” efforts. He has worked with several small businesses, developing website and identity designs, low cost marketing strategies, and social media marketing campaigns.
