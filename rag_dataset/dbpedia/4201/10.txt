Agent: A Transfer Is Neither on His nor the Club’s Agenda

Leicester City will retain the services of their stand-out Turkish defender, Caglar Soyuncu, after the player’s agent ruled out a move away from the King Power Stadium.

Brendan Rodgers had previously stated that none of his key players would be leaving in January.

However, Soyuncu’s agent Mustafa Dogru has added extra comfort to Foxes fans by saying the central defender is committed to Leicester.

Speaking to Turkish radio station Radyosport (via the Leicester Mercury), Dogru said: “After such performances in the Premier League, it is quite natural for transfer news to appear.

“Caglar now focuses on the success of the team. A transfer is neither on his nor the club’s agenda.

“I don’t know what’s going on in the future, but he’s thinking about his achievements at Leicester City and with the national team.”

Soyuncu struggled for form in his debut season with City, making just four Premier League starts after his £19 million switch from German side Freiburg.

The defender has now fully adapted to life in the UK, playing every minute for City this season.

As a result of his top-class performances, the defender has earned plenty of praise.

“I have to say, he’s performing well above our expectations,” Dogru added.

“Obviously, we were thinking he would get more playing time this season.

“It’s down Caglar’s talent, his mental quality, as well as the influence of his coach and team-mates.

“A football player is always open to development.

“He makes very healthy decisions under pressure and he is good with both feet, helped by playing a midfielder in previous teams. His manager’s confidence also affects him.

“He can still get much better. He will write his name in gold letters in the history of the Premier League.”
