Robert White, a founding member of ASGCA and first president of the PGA of America, helped lay the foundation for American golf. Born in St. Andrews, Scotland, he emigrated in 1894 to the United States to study agronomy. He then served as greenkeeper at several courses across the United States while assisting on a number of course layouts. He also was responsible for planning and revising several other golf courses.

White joined ASGCA in 1947 and served as an ASGCA member for 12 years until his death in 1959.
