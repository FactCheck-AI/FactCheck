About the film:

World Premiere, 2023 Melbourne International Film Festival

Hailed as “a one band war”, The Birthday Party with Nick Cave was one of the definitive post-punk groups and goth rock pioneers, creative and destructive in equal measure. Their incendiary live performances were the stuff of violent, anarchic legend.

Featuring a wealth of rare and unseen archives, original artwork, unreleased tracks, studio footage, animation, and shocking behind-the-scenes stories from the group’s members, Mutiny in Heaven is a story of epic struggle, artistic genius and total chaos that tracks the band’s arc from breakthrough to break-up.
