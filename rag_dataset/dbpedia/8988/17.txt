Prior to Green Bay

The 6-foot-7 Parham comes to Green Bay from Wabash Valley College in Illinois, where he averaged 15.4 PPG and 5.4 RPG in 30 games last year as a freshman. The native of Chicago and well-respected Marian Catholic High School graduate will have three years of eligibility remaining with the Phoenix, after sitting out his first year out of high school at Army.

"The coaching staff and campus are great. I felt like both the coaching staff and the campus have a great family environment. They embrace their players and allow them to be the best players they can be," Parham said.

Parham played high school basketball with Phoenix Suns guard Tyler Ulis, who attended the University of Kentucky out of high school as one of the nation's top recruits. Parham and Ulis led Marian Catholic to a 27-3 record their senior year and were ranked in the top 10 of the state of Illinois and in the top 200 nationally. He helped lead his team to the Super-Sectionals (Elite Eight), where he scored 30 points in his team's defeat.

"We are looking forward to having TJ in our program. He can play multiple positions for us and can get hot at any time. TJ completed two summer boot camps and comes from a well-respected junior college program in Wabash Valley, and he will bring in veteran presence," Darner said.
