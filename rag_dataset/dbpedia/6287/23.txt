Back in July, I reported that Alfonso Cuarón was supposed to be shooting his next film, “Jane,” starring Charlize Theron, in the fall. Then the SAG-AFTRA strike happened and it put a damper on the entire project.

Now, there’s word that Cuarón has moved on to another project, which he plans to shoot “later this year.” The only details gathered are that it’s titled “Billy Please Call Home” and based on a screenplay Cuaron wrote 20 years ago. It’ll be produced by Mark Johnson, who was behind Cuaron’s 1995 debut “ A Little Princess.”

Cuarón also has “Disclaimer,” an Apple TV series coming later this year, and starring Cate Blanchett. Filming on the series began in June 2022 and wrapped in March 2023. In fact, one source told me that “Disclaimer” was shot in the UK over the course of a whopping 280 days.

Cuarón is the director of “Y Tu Mama Tambien,” “Gravity” and “Children of Men.” He hasn’t released a film since 2018’s Oscar nominated “Roma.” Whatever he does next will be highly anticipated.
