10 Available from GGs longtime cohort, fellow trouble maker and dear friend, Mucous Mike. 10 available. A special limited 8x10 printing of a never-seen unpublished photo of GG Allin from my personal collection taken by myself, made available in solemn recognition of GG’s untimely death 30 years ago on June 28, 1993. The photo was taken shortly after GGs 1st release from prison at the home of Jeff Clayton of ANTiSEEN in Charlotte, NC on May 11, 1991. GG called to tell me about an in-store appearance he was doing at Repo Records and a photo shoot afterwards. After the appearance a small group of us went to Jeff’s house to have the photo shoot for the new GG album ‘Murder Junkies’ with ANTiSEEN in Jeff's basement. These session photos have been seen over the years on the album iterations and various blogs and websites, but this one shot never has been available. The only other prints made were four 8x10s, three signed by GG in Atlanta in his Clermont Motel room in December 1991 for me and a couple of friends, the fourth given to GG for his personal collection. The photo features a full body color GG with an axe during a break in the photo shoot. Most photos from that day feature GG with some or all the band, most of them published in Black and White. This is the only known full color shot from the photo shoot of just GG in the basement. Prints are on heavy stock for color quality. Great for framing. I sent a pre-sale copy to Güs Sissüm for his opinion on quality and he approved for each photo to have a special rainbow refractor Blood Orange ‘Official GG Allin Merchandise’ sticker affixed to the back to authorize the rare print. Güs has only used these BOR stickers a few times for special limited offerings on his website, such as the 2023 GG calendar & Christmas eat shit plate, so they are also rare. Along with the BOR sticker is a small holographic serial number sticker and a handwritten print run numbering denoting the print as one of only 93 copies from my original 35mm negative that will be made and offered to collectors. These will never be printed again from the fragile celluloid negative, so only buyers of this print run will have an official copy with the authorization stickers on the back. Some of the images were watermarked to prevent copying from eBay but the finished product is nice and clean. I have included a copy shown in an 8x10 frame as an example. Great for your office desk, mantelpiece, thoughtful holiday gift, and private collections. No frame included. Winning bidders will receive the limited 8x10 color print as described safely packed and shipped via First Class USPS. As a bonus for collectors, I am also including a 4x6 color print with matching #. As a special bonus I am also including a cardstock reproduction print from my personal collection of the Repo Records in-store flyer advertising the appearance on May 11, 1991.
