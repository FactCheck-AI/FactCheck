Allin is featured extensively in the documentary film Hated: GG Allin and the Murder Junkies, by future Road Trip and The Hangover director Todd Phillips.

Allin was also bass player in late 70's Boston punk group Thrills (a.k.a. City Thrills), who released several singles and were the subject of a later CD discography. He subsequently joined the band Cheater Slicks, and played bass guitar on their debut album, "On Your Knees".
