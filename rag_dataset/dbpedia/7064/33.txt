The Urskog–Høland Line, affectionately known as Tertitten, is a narrow gauge railway located between Sørumsand and Skulerud in Norway. This railway line is a significant part of Norway's history and offers a unique experience for visitors. The original line was 57 kilometers long and was built in three stages, with the first stage opening in 1896. Today, a part of this line is preserved as a museum at Sørumsand in Lillestrøm kommune.

This museum offers visitors a chance to explore the history of the railway line and experience a piece of Norway's past. The museum is a testament to the importance of the railway in Norway's history and its continued relevance today.
