Biography: Carlo Gambino led the Gambino crime family in New York City during the 20th Century, in which time he played a significant role in shaping organized crime in the United States.

Gambino was born in Sicily in 1902 and immigrated to the United States as a young man. He quickly became involved in criminal activities and joined the organization of Joe Masseria, a powerful Mafia boss.

During the Castellammarese War, a conflict between rival Mafia factions, Gambino aligned himself with the eventual winner, Salvatore Maranzano. After Maranzano's murder, Gambino became a member of the Mangano crime family, which would later be renamed the Gambino family after he took control.

Gambino's rise to power was marked by strategic alliances and his involvement in significant events, such as the murder of Albert Anastasia in 1957. As the head of the Gambino family, he appointed key figures like Joseph Biondo and Aniello Dellacroce to important positions.

Gambino also played a central role in the Commission, a governing body of the American Mafia. He took control of the Commission after the imprisonment of Vito Genovese in 1959, solidifying his influence over organized crime in the United States.

Despite his extensive criminal activities, Gambino managed to avoid lengthy prison sentences. He faced legal troubles and deportation proceedings but often used his health issues, particularly a heart condition, to his advantage in court.

Gambino died of a heart attack in 1976 at his home in New York. His funeral was attended by hundreds of people, including many watching law enforcement officials. After his death, his brother-in-law Paul Castellano took over the Gambino family, which soon led to violent conflict within the family.
