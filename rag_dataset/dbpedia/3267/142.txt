Welcome back to your favorite podcast about some of the biggest bombs in cinematic history. On this week’s episode, we once again find ourselves in sci-fi town with the 2015 space opera film Jupiter Ascending. Boasting a budget north of $200M, Jupiter Ascending left general audiences bewildered by the lack of character development, terrible script, nonexistent performances, dodgy CGI, and whatever Eddie Redmayne was doing on screen. This film is a misfire on all aspects. One starts to wonder just how it all went wrong and how The Wachowskis could go from The Matrix to a dog-man “surfing” with gravity boots. Woof!

Jupiter Ascending is directed by The Wachowskis and stars Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, Sean Bean, Eddie Redmayne, and Douglas Booth.
