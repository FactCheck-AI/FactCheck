The good news was we got to sit down With Douglas Booth yesterday - the not entirely un-handsome star of 'The Riot Club', 'Great Expectations' and now 'Jupiter Ascending'.

The bad news was we were only allowed FIVE minutes - count 'em - with Douglas, which meant we couldn't entirely go into the complicated sub-layers of the Wachowaskis' latest mind-boggling, unearthly, sci-fi offering, in which he stars alongside Mila Kunis, Channing Tatum, Sean Bean and man of the hour Eddie Redmayne.

In 'Jupiter Ascending', Douglas stars as Titus, one of three squabbling Abrasax siblings, living in some far-off place, who have inherited the universe on the death of their mother.

However, all their plans are thrown into chaos, when it turns out there's someone down on Earth in the form of Jupiter Jones, played by Mila Kunis. She's currently cleaning toilets, but it seems she may have a claim to the biggest throne of all...

'Jupiter Ascending' is in UK cinemas from today 6 February. Watch the trailer below...
