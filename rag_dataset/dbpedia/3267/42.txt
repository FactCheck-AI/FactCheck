The space epic is at cinemas now

Space epic Jupiter Ascending stars Mila Kunis as Jupiter Jones, a downtrodden cleaner whose fortunes change when genetically engineered ex-military hunter Caine (Channing Tatum) comes to earth and reveals that she’s next in line for an extraordinary inheritance that could alter the balance of the cosmos.

To celebrate the movie’s release this weekend, Douglas Booth, who stars as alien royal/playboy Titus Abrasax, dropped by for a chat with In:Demand Showbiz.
