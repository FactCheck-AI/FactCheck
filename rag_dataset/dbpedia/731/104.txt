Motorstorm RC has been announced by Sony for PlayStation Network and PlayStation Vita.

The game is a new take on the popular PlayStation 3 racing franchise, as players drive miniature remote controlled cars through the series' signature off-road environments.

Motorstorm RC features 16 unique tracks spread across four environments from past Motorstorm titles.

More than 100 customised cars will be available, falling into the categories of Buggies, Superminis, Rally Cars, Muscle Cars, Racing Trucks, Supercars, Big Rigs and Monster Trucks.

It will release simultaneously for PlayStation Vita and on PlayStation 3 through PlayStation Network. Users only need to purchase the game once to be able to play on both systems.

The PlayStation 3 version will also include a four-player split-screen multiplayer mode.

Sony has confirmed that Motorstorm RC will be available in time for the PlayStation Vita's February 22 launch, though an exact release date was not revealed.
