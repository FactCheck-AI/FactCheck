MotorStorm Arctic Edge

The hit PS3 series MotorStorm slams its way onto the PlayStation Portable in MotorStorm Arctic Edge that transfers this popular off-road racing game onto this handheld console. Thankfully the developers have managed to capture the original fast-paced gameplay of the PS3 as player�s race on a variety of tracks with a good selection of vehicles to assist in the process. As this is an open world racer, the one "hit" that the PlayStation Portable took was in the graphics department and although the game does not look as shiny and impressive as the PS3 version, where it matters is with the gameplay and I can safely say that it works quite well.

With a variety of different gameplay modes that includes quick races to career, gamers are definitely spoilt for choice. The tracks of MotorStorm Arctic Edge is set in Alaska and the developers have successfully managed to capture the look and even feel of this environment with 12 courses being made available to the player. Whether you�re racing through a lumber yard or driving on dangerously high mountains, the variety actually assists with the replay value of the title, although most gamers will find their favourites early on in the game. These environments are also quite perilous, whether it�s avalanches triggered by horns or ice bridges collapsing with heavy vehicles, it�s quite cool indeed. In terms of gameplay, you need to "win" additional events in the game by coming in the top 3 which does you give some incentive to continue playing not to mention your trophy collection.

When it comes to vehicles, the player has access to six different vehicle classes that include bikes, ATVs, buggies and two new snow classes. The control system on the PSP works well and the buttons have been well mapped, including the use of the analog stick. With that said, the learning curve is quite low which should always be the case for a game of this genre. Of course, the turbo functionality of this game is still the most fun aspect of MotorStorm but should be used carefully because this can also cause you a disadvantage. Although the game has no tutorial per se, the game does offer a Free Play mode that allows you to roam around without any competitive edge and allows you to get a good handle on the vehicle. When you�re not racing, the game even contains a garage that allows for basic customisation options such as liveries and body parts.

As opposed to the single-player mode, MotorStorm Arctic Edge offers some fun multiplayer modes such as adhoc racing and online multiplayer. The online play is really fantastic and we had some great fun playing with other owners of this game across the globe. The game even supports up to eight racers via online mode which is quite cool considering the size and limited power of this console. For those playing the single-player game, the AI in the title and depending on what vehicle you are controlling can provide some challenges but for the majority, once you have raced a few tracks and tested out the vehicles, you'll be able to compensate for any short falls.

Graphically, the game may not be as shiny as the PS3 version, however the PSP version does successfully manage to recreate the atmosphere of the game. Although the vehicles look a little basic compared to its more powerful next-gen console, the sense of speed and environment is all there. Add in a great soundtrack and a variety of vehicle sounds and this is sturdy looking and sounding title. And if you don�t like the soundtrack, the game even allows you to customise your own soundtrack with your own music. Another notch up in the cool factor.
