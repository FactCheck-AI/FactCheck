PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- The Pittsburgh Penguins will host the New York Rangers in the team's home opener at PPG Paints Arena. The game will also serve as the Penguins' season opener.

The game is scheduled for Oct. 9.

The Penguins are coming off a 2023-24 season where they amassed 88 points and a 38-32-12 record but missed the playoffs for the second consecutive year.

The off-season is now in full swing for Pittsburgh, who recently acquired forward Kevin Hayes from the St. Louis Blues before drafting six new prospects into their organization.
