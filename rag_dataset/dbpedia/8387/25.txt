FIRST EDITION of Walras' most important book. In 1874, three years after Jevons and Menger, but independently of them, Walras enunciated the marginal utility doctrine in his Éléments d'économie politique pure. In this work he continued and refined the work inherited from his father and was successful in developing the law of general equilibrium which made him famous. The work is divided into two parts: one dealing with the theory of exchange and the other with the theory of production. Walras is best known for his mathematical treatment of economics - he was influenced by Cournot - and the extreme care he showed in his works in distinguishing theory and practice. He is, therefore, essentially the economist's economist, rather than of the general reader or politician. Cossa 279 (171); Einaudi 5965. Walker 95 & 113.
