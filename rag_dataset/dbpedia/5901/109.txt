Synopsis:

Cape Fear (1991)

The film stars Oscar winner Robert De Niro (Casino, Heat) as Max Cady, a psychopath who has recently been released from prison. He is out seeking revenge on his lawyer Sam Bowden, played by Nick Nolte (48 Hours, Thin Red Line) who he believes deliberately withheld information about his case at trial which could have kept him out of jail. He embarks on a mission to terrorise Bowden, his wife, played by Oscar-winner Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Rob Roy) and their 15 year old daughter played by Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers). A remake of the 1962 classic film, this has guest appearances from the stars of the original film, Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck. The film is directed by one of the leading filmmakers of his generation, Oscar-nominated, Martin Scorcese.

The film also stars Polly Bergen (Cry Baby, Move Over Darling) and was directed by highly acclaimed British director, J. Lee Thompson (The Guns of Navarone, MacKenna`s Gold).
