France or what's officially the French Republic, French France or République Française, is a country of northwestern Europe. It's one of the most historically and culturally important nations in the Western world. The country has also played an extremely vital role in international affairs, with former colonies in every part of the world. The franc, also commonly recognized as the French franc (FF), is the currency of France.

Between 1360 and 1641, the franc was the name of coins worth 1 livre tournois, and it continued in common language as a term for this amount of money. In 1975, it was reintroduced in decimal form and was revalued in 1960 after two hundred years of inflation. Each of the new francs (NF) was worth 100 old francs. The new francs designation was prolonged for a few years just before the currency went back to simply being the franc. Most older French residents continued to reference and value their items in terms of the old franc, which was equivalent to the new centime. It was until 2002, in the introduction of the euro, that they stopped referencing it. The French franc was a regularly held international reserve currency of reference during the 19th and 20th centuries.
