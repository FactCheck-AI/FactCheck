Michael Caine serves up some bloody good British revenge in GET CARTER.

Based on the Ted Lewis novel, Jack’s Return Home, Get Carter is as gritty and British as crime thrillers go. It shows the bloody trail of revenge through the seedy underbelly of Newcastle as the cold-blooded London gangster, Jack Carter, tries to get to the bottom of his brother’s death. Believing he was murdered, Carter works his way through thugs in search of the kingpin to get to the truth.

Part of Nitehawk’s fall CRIME series.
