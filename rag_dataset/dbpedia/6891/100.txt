Robert Musil is widely considered to be one of the most important authors in the development of the modernist novel. During his lifetime, however, he made little money from his writing, despite his nomination for the Nobel Prize in Literature. He died relatively unknown and remained so until he was rediscovered in the 1950s. His eight books have since reappeared in print in several languages.
