Sunday 20th October 1996. As a teenager in my parents car listening to the football on the radio. Newcastle are 4-0 up. It's 80 odd minutes on the clock when Philipe Albert picks the ball up in the Man U half, strides further up the pitch. He keeps going then chips. Up and over the legendary Schmeichel's head.

An amazing finish to an amazing game.

Newcastle United Foundation have a heritage project for fans of all ages called Toon Times.

Toon Times will culminate with a major Newcastle United exhibition at the Discovery Museum, Newcastle, although in the lead up to this event Toon Times wishes to reach out to all Newcastle United fans across the North East and further afield to get involved and share their memories, experiences, photos and memorabilia what people have collected over the years.

We are supporting the project by helping to collect NUFC memories online - fans can share their memories on the Replay Football website, simply select the Toon Times tag when submitting yours.

For more info contact the Toon Times Heritage Project Coordinator, Newcastle United Foundation, gavin.ferry@nufc.co.uk
