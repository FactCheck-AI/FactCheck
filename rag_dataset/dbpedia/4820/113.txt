The 19-year-old midfielder, who hails from Carlisle, has been named on the bench on a handful of occasions this season - including for home and away games against Manchester United and the recent visit of Manchester City to St. James' Park.

But, although he featured for United in pre-season, coming off the bench in a friendly at Rotherham in July before making another substitute appearance at Burton and starting in a practice match at Burnley, he has yet to make his senior competitive debut, so has been allowed to join Pools in order to add to his experience.

White has represented England at under-18 level and signed his first professional contract in 2019. His grandfather, Peter Hampton, played for Leeds United during the 1970s and 1980s as well playing more than 100 games each for Stoke City and Burnley.

Hartlepool won promotion from the National League last term and are currently 16th in League Two.
