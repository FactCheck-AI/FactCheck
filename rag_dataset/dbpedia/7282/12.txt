House Leaders & Heads of House

The House Leader monitors each studentâ€™s progress, both academically and personally. The House Leader should be approached if there are any personal problems, school problems, and problems with the work and can refer students to counselling support. The House Leader is the contact point in the school for parents with questions or concerns. They are a great resource for students to gain assistance from in selecting a suitable course for their Year 10-12 studies given their knowledge of each student.

Heads of House are able to provide students looking at alternate pathways with support and guidance in this area.
