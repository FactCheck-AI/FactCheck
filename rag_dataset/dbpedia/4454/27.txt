T he Railway Museum in Warsaw is the largest of its kind in Poland. It takes you through the history of the railway from its beginnings to the present, not only in Poland but also in Europe and worldwide.

The largest exhibition space, located directly behind the ticket counter, presents the global history of the railway. Over time, the focus narrows down to the development in Poland. Everything is well-explained and even understandable for laypeople.

A delightful sight for the eyes is the wide variety of locomotive and wagon models. In another room, tools and uniforms are displayed.

The highlight is outside: Old, mostly restored locomotives. Here, the heart of railway enthusiasts beats faster!

T he Railway Museum offers a special exhibition. It is ideal for children and teenagers, but adults also find enjoyment here. Most museums in Warsaw are historical museums, sometimes itâ€™s nice to have something simpler.

We are positively surprised by the size of the exhibition, especially the locomotives standing on the old tracks in the outdoor area. One can learn a lot here, especially when booking a guided tour with a museum guide. All in all, the museum leaves a very good impression, is well-organized, and the exhibition is worth the money.

There is an access road leading to the museum entrance, where you can find nine bicycle parking spaces.

In front of the entrance, guests have access to a free, though not supervised, cloakroom. A changing table is also available.

On-site, visitors can purchase literature from a small in-house library (mainly in Polish).
