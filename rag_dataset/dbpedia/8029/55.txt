An utterly stunning, powerful and unforgettable novella by the highly acclaimed and much missed Mal Peet. Featuring sensitive full colour illustrations by talented rising star, Emma Shoard.

When a man returns to his childhood home and visits the derelict tree house in which his father once chose to live, he recalls the past unravelling of his family, the unspoken strangeness of their lives, and the impact on his own adult life. Beautiful, sparse and insightful storytelling. Particularly suitable for struggling, reluctant or dyslexic readers aged 14+
