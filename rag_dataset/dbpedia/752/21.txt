Good Day: I am looking for the Beijing Postal Code for #52 Third Ring Road. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Answered by Ms.Evelyn

I don't know Third Ring Road belongs to which district of Beijing. So, just write down 100000. It's Beijing zip code. It's also Ok. The mail carrier knows it very well.

Asked by Mrs.GABRIELA HERNANDEZ (MEXICO)

Hi. I was wondering if anyone can help me. Im trying to call China Courier Service Corporation as well , and I already tried the 0086 1185 and it doesnt seem to be right. it doesnt go thru. Im from Mexico. I dont know if there is some other number i must add. I tried sending them an email but they dont seem to have. Im trying to track a package that I bought from E-replica store about a month ago an it hasnt arrived yet and they dont give a crap about it. so its all messed up. and thats why im trying to call the courier service.

thanks!!!
