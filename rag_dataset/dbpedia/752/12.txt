Beijing has many international schools, most of which are in the east part of the city. Some may be restricted to children of non-PRC nationals only, while others are open to all nationalities. Local public (government-provided) schools are difficult for non-PRC nationals to enter. There are also local private schools, with teaching in Chinese. Fees for these are usually lower than for the international schools.

The list of international schools below is for reference only. It is non-exhaustive and is not an endorsement of any of the schools. Descriptions are provided by the schools. The list is in alphabetical order.

The British School of Beijing

The British School of Beijing (BSB) was founded in 2003 and is the oldest British style school in the city. Our curriculum follows the English National Curriculum, with adjustments made to reflect our international context. We currently have 2 campuses: Our Sanlitun campus is conveniently located in the heart of the Embassy district and offers high quality primary education. Itâs cosy but purposeful and has gained this school a fantastic reputation as a family orientated campus. Our Shunyi campus is situated in the family friendly suburbs on the outskirts of Beijing. It is perfectly placed for the most popular expatriate friendly housing compounds and offers primary and secondary education. At our school respect, good manners and personal responsibility are highly valued and these elements are reinforced daily through the culture of the school which places a premium on social graces and considerate behavior.
