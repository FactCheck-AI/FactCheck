John Delwin Sherwood, age 90, of Mount Vernon, Arkansas, passed away at his home on December 12th surrounded by his loving wife and family.

John was born January 17, 1927, to Dan Junius and Sophronia Brown Sherwood in St. Johns, Arizona. He was the 12th of 14 children and one of seven brothers who served in World War II. After his military service he served a two-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 1951 he married Barbara Lee Jones, who has been his sweetheart for sixty-six years. They moved to Arkansas in 1960 where they had a cattle farm and raised a large family of 14 children. He is preceded in death by his parents, 11 of his siblings, his son Delwin, 2 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren and is survived by his wife Barbara, his children: Warren, Steve, Denna, Linda, Jacolyn, Gary, John, Barton, Edwin, Shawna, LeAnna, Chad, Brent, and 68 grandchildren and 130 great-grandchildren.

God, Family, and Country meant everything to John, and he was a great pillar to not only his wife and children but to countless others who were edified and inspired by his love, conviction, and service. He lived an exemplary life and was relentless in sharing his testimony of Jesus Christ.
