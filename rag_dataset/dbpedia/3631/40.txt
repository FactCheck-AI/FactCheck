Santa Maria is the largest and fastest growing city in Santa Barbara County. Over time, Santa Barbara County’s population has shifted towards the more affordable northern end of the county, which is more rural, working-class and majority Latino. Yet despite Santa Maria’s over 75% Latino population, these demographics are still not fully reflected in political and economic leadership in the region. With an economy rooted in oil, agriculture, and the military, the Santa Maria Valley has been historically conservative, but that is changing with a new generation. With a median age of just 29, Santa Maria’s population is one of the youngest in the Central Coast. As a center of industrial agriculture, Santa Maria has attracted immigrants from across the world to work in the fields, set deep roots and raise families in the community, but the town has long been marked with political conflicts over immigration. As Santa Maria grows, it continues to change, with a greater focus on investing in youth, being inclusive of immigrant families, and diversifying its economy. CAUSE and its predecessor organization PUEBLO have worked in Santa Maria for many years to advance the city’s approach to immigrant rights, expand public transit and youth programs, and uplift farmworker rights.
