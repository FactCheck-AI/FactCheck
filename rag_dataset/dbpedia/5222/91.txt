Following the signing of the contract at the end of April, Cindy has already staged several performances in various towns in the region, including Busia, Nakuru and Eldoret in Kenya in early May. She is expected to stage more shows later in the year.

Grandpa Records founder Yusuf 'Refigah' Noah said the label had been negotiating with the singer for close to a year. He explained that it was no longer "easy" for artists to join his stable. Before signing any artists, thorough background checks are done to avoid the label working with artists who are not up to scratch.

Sanyu is a former member of the now-defunct Ugandan all-girl group Blu*3 alongside Lilian Mbabazi and Jackie Chandiru. She went solo in 2008, releasing her debut solo album Ayokyayokya in 2009. Since then she has released popular singles such as 'Selecta' and 'Still Standing'.

Besides the new contract with Grandpa Records, Cindy has also recently entered into an agreement with Kampala nightclub Liquid Silk (a spin-off of the popular Club Silk) to perform live with her band on the third Saturday of every month.
