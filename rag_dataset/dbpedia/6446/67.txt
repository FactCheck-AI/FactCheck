The younger brother of actor Sean Penn, Chris Penn, has died.

Sean Penn's publicist says Chris Penn was found dead in Santa Monica, California. Police say the actor's body was found in a residence.

Penn spent his career in the shadow of his more successful older brother. His earlier movies include "Footloose." The song "Let's Hear it For the Boy" was about Penn's character, who was taught to dance by Kevin Bacon's character.

Later, among his many films, Penn was in "Reservoir Dogs," "True Romance" and "Mulholland Falls."

He recently had guest roles on "Will and Grace" and "Entourage."
