Character actor Chris Penn, younger brother of Oscar-winner Sean Penn, has been found dead at an apartment near the Pacific Ocean in the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica.

No cause of death was immediately determined but there was no signs of foul play, police sources say.

A family spokeswoman confirmed the death and said the Penn family "would appreciate the media's respect of their privacy during this difficult time".

Penn, 43, was a character actor who appeared in dozens of films including Reservoir Dogs, Mullholland Falls and the 2004 film Starsky & Hutch.

In one of his best known roles, he played baby-faced criminal Nice Guy Eddie Cabot in director Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs.

He also starred along with his brother in the 1986 film At Close Range.

Recently, Penn voiced Officer Eddie Pulaski in the video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
