Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa are featured in this new behind the scenes studio footage published to the web today by production team 1500 or Nothin. The two heavy-smoking rap superstars hit the lab together to work on a new collaboration, and this video takes us into their session with 1500 or Nothin as they lay down their vocals and vibe together behind the boards.

Watch above, and look out for cameos by Warren G and YG also.
