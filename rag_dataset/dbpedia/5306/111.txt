It’s official, rising star Ty Dolla $ign is the newest member of Wiz Khalifa’s Taylor Gang. The Atlantic Records artist who’s been hard at work and boasts successful past collaborations with the likes of Young Jeezy, Joe Moses, E-40, Terrace Martin and YG keeps his momentum going with no signs of slowing down. With his highly anticipated Beach House 2 taking over the internet today, it’s no surprise fellow Taylor Gang artists Wiz Khalifa, Chevy Woods and Juicy J made the cut onto the mixtape’s track list. According to an in-house source, though there has not been an official announcement issued just yet, fans should expect to see more collaborations and continued support from members of the TGOD camp for Ty in the near future.
