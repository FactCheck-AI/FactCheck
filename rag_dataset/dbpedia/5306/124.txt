Wiz Khalifa and his Taylor Gang crew have landed on the cover of the latest issue of The Source. In the photo, Khalifa dons a Jimi Hendrix-esque fringe leather vest with a full-length American flag draped over his right shoulder. Flanking the crew leader on either side are fellow Gang members Juicy J, Lola Monroe and Chevy Woods.

In the issue, the whole Taylor Gang crew is profiled and Wiz talks about an official TG mixtape, his own upcoming album O.N.I.F.C. and his relationship with fiancée Amber Rose.

In a separate interview with Hot 97's Peter Rosenberg, Khalifa revealed that he's also planning on working with Dr. Dre. The 24-year-old rapper said he spoke with the iconic producer during the recent Coachella Music Festival, where he was a featured performer during Dre's headlining set with Snoop Dogg. Khalifa said he has high hopes for a collaboration.

“We're gonna get in the studio together and it’s gonna be amazing, man,” he said.
