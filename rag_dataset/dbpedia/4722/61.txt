Known for its authentic Russian river cruises, cruise line Vodohod has joined CLIA’s European community.

The cruise line has partnered with the industry figurehead to build brand awareness across Europe, attracting more passengers to Russia’s waterways.

The partnership will bring the Russian line into CLIA’s Europe’s wider community of cruise lines, travel agents and executive partners.

Discussing the move, CLIA UK & Ireland director Andy Harmer said: “We are thrilled to have Vodohod join CLIA and we look forward to working with them closely. Over recent months, the river cruise sector has been slowly starting up again, as ships gradually resume sailings.

“The recent addition of Vodohod to CLIA bears testament to the continued desire for travellers to cruise and their confidence that the industry will always have the health and safety of passengers and crew as the number one priority.”

CEO of Vodohod Russian River Cruises, Rishat Bagautdinov, added: “Vodohod is delighted to join CLIA, the cruise industry’s leading professional association. We look forward to contributing to CLIA’s important work in advocating for our industry.”

Vodohod UK-based managing director, John Warner, concluded: “The immense Russia waterways and Vodohod as a brand largely remain a secret to the international river cruise traveller.

“We hope by partnering with CLIA we can demystify Russia as a destination and help educate the industry about the benefits of Russian river cruising with Vodohod.”

The cruise line is headquartered in Moscow and St Petersburg and operates more than 50 passenger ships on the Volga, Don, Kama, Moscow and Volga-Don Canals, Volga-Baltic Waterway and lakes Ladoga and Onega.

Celebrating the partnership, CLIA is hosting a special live webinar on 7 October named ‘New to CLIA’.
