JACKSON, Miss. – Pat Fordice, a former first lady of Mississippi and champion of arts, literacy and beautification, was remembered in services in Jackson Monday. She died Thursday at 72.

Fordice, who had announced that she had cancer in December 2006, became a public figure after her then-husband Kirk Fordice, a brash, millionaire construction company owner, was elected in 1991 as Mississippi’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction.

She was instrumental in bringing two popular international art exhibitions to Jackson.

In 1996, “Palaces of St. Petersburg: Russian Imperial Style” featured tapestries, china, paintings and other glittering objects. Two years later, the “Splendors of Versailles,” featured French treasures.

The Fordices divorced in 2000 after 44 years of marriage. Kirk Fordice died of leukemia in 2004.

After leaving the Governor’s Mansion in January 2000, Pat Fordice remained active as host of a radio talk show and co-host of a television talk show.

She also appeared in a series of commercials for Keep Mississippi Beautiful and the Mississippi Department of Transportation as part of an antilittering campaign.

In recent years, Pat Fordice supported the children’s hospital at the University of Mississippi, the Mississippi School for the Arts, the International Ballet Competition and the Special Olympics.
