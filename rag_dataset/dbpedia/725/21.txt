"It's sad to see such a beautiful, historic building go," one resident told Patch.

AURORA, IL â€” An Aurora landmark has been destroyed by fire and now the city plans to demolish the remaining parts of the building to keep residents safe. Firefighters have been battling the blaze at the historic Masonic Temple since around 10 p.m. Tuesday, when a bystander called to report the fire.

As of 6 p.m., the fire was still smoldering.

According to Aurora Fire Department Battalion Chief Jim Rhodes, two exterior walls of the nearly 100-year-old building collapsed during the fire.

Several streets were closed in downtown Aurora Monday night after what's been described as a "major" fire broke out in the 100 block of South Lincoln Avenue.

On social media, residents shared video that showed the fire apparently tearing through the city's abandoned Lincoln Masonic Temple.

Residents were advised to avoid the area as crews continued to work to extinguish the flames in the historic building.

Hector Ortiz said he lives near the Masonic Temple and walked close by to take photographs and video.

Ortiz told Patch, "[I]t's sad to see such a beautiful historical building go. Wish there would have been more efforts to protect and preserve the building in previous years after it closed down."

Just after 11 p.m., ComEd reported more than 500 people without power in the area.

The Masonic Temple was built in 1922 and had since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

No injuries have been reported at press time.

Fire officials are still investigating the cause of the blaze.
