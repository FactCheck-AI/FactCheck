This is an original, one-sheet movie poster from 1951 for a theatrical re-release of Caesar and Cleopatra (1945) starring Vivien Leigh, Claude Rains, Stewart Granger, Flora Robson, Francis L. Sullivan, Robert Adams, and Basil Sydney. Gabriel Pascal directed the historical epic.

The poster measures 27" x 41" and has been linen-backed for long-term preservation and display. The poster was in good to very good condition prior to restoration with pinholes and a few tape stains in the corners from theatrical display, minor surface and edge wear, and tiny separations at the cross-folds. It was folded at the time of printing but the folds are less noticeable after linen-backing. Linen-backed posters are stored flat and rolled for shipping in a rigid, tube mailer.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image.

This rare and collectible movie poster, printed in 1951 to promote a limited, theatrical re-release of Caesar and Cleopatra, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
