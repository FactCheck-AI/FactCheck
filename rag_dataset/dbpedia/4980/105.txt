Used golf balls arrive at our facility in Tennessee almost every day and in EVERY condition you can imagine. Some have only been hit once or twice or used on just couple of holes. Others have spent a month or so in a pond.

Once we get them we thoroughly scrub then sort them (by HAND). Sorting is a manual process. One ball at a time, by experienced members of our team.

Sorting is kind of complicated as we must get rid of bad balls, divide the good balls by grade and further divide by application (Driving Range/Practice vs Competition).

Here is how we sort and grade them:

Competition Golf Balls: MINT

This is the only gradation we sell for used competition golf balls. You play these balls...they are not meant for driving range practice. they are meant to save you money as they are priced WAY below retail.

Our Range / Practice golf balls are for practice on the driving range. These balls typically have stripes on them, logos, or the word PRACTICE stamped on them. We carry FOUR grades of these balls: A B C and D.

These golf balls are the highest quality used golf ball in the marketplace. They are like new and will feel and play as a new golf ball would. Its shading is excellent. This mix may HAVE corporate LOGOS* and player pen markings, but NO cuts or NO scuffs.

*Percentage varies anywhere from 0% to 100% logo balls depending on inventory.

Competition Golf Balls: REFURBISHED

We no longer offer our Refurbished products. Thank you to those who have been fans over the years.

Range/Practice Golf Balls

Range/Practice Golf Balls: A Grade:

Top of the line...these range balls still have a lot of life left. They have good shine and most of the stripes are still there.

Range/Practice Golf Balls: B Grade:

Good range balls. Stripes and shine are starting to wear down. You might notice cosmetic flaws wear. Still very playable, expect tanning on some golf balls of this grade. Logo will be on some golf balls depending on our inventory.

Range/Practice Golf Balls: C Grade:

Good For Winter Ranges. Less stripes and manufacturer markings than the B Grade. Some will have logos, tanning, scuffs and players' pen marks, etc.

Range/Practice Golf Balls: D Grade:

This is the last date these golf balls will go on. These babies are priced to MOVE so when you lose them, nobody is going to care. Great for hit-away situations or on ranges where ball retieval is difficult. Many of this D Grade are sold for knocking off the boat or pier and into the lake. These are NOT pretty...but we sell a LOT of them as they are a great value! We try to clean them but some may be a bit dirty. Don't be amazed if you can't tell who manufactured them!
