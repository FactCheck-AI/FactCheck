2015 Turing Laureate (Computing's Nobel Prize)

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

Foundation of Internet Encryption

We have a very special announcement today advising that a founding father of Internet encryption, Whitfield Diffie, has joined BankVault as an Advisor and Stakeholder.

In 2015 Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman won the $1M Turing Prize (computing's Nobel Prize) for the invention of public-key encryption. The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange is the foundation that secures almost all Internet communication. Every device, every browser, has the Diffie-Hellman algorithm embedded natively - facilitating over $4 trillion per day in global transactions.

Their discovery is a work of genius. A mathematician by background, Whit's deep non-intuitive insights discovered a fundamental principle that allows two independent parties to set up a common security-secret in public, and then use this to encrypt their communication across that same public network.

Whit is a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (RoyalSociety.org) and was a Sun Microsystems Fellow before the company was acquired by Oracle.

Here is a short video on the significance of their work

An interesting twist and symmetry to this is that Martin Hellman has joined BankVault's competitor Beyond Identity. Balance is restored to the universe.
