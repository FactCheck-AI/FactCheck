Potsdamer Platz is a railway station in Berlin. It is completely underground and situated underneath the Potsdamer Platz in central Berlin. Regional and S-Bahn services call at the station.

History

The first station at Potsdamer Platz was the Potsdamer Bahnhof terminus, which was closed on September 27, 1945 due to war damage. The S-Bahn station, situated in the Nord-SÃ¼d-Tunnel, was situated directly under the Berlin Wall and became a ghost station between 1961 and 1989.

The station was extensively remodeled and rebuilt in the 1990s.

U-Bahn

The station also has the rail text color|system=BVG|line=U2 line of the Berlin U-Bahn calling at a subterranean platform.

Trivia

The long-distance station is, strictly speaking, not a station but just a stop, as it lacks the points required to be classified as a station under German law.
