Robert Vaughn, the actor best known for playing super spy Napoleon Solo in the Man from UNCLE, has passed away at 83 from cancer (leukemia).

His other TV roles include wealthy detective Harry Rule in the 1970s series The Protectors; General Hunt Stockwell in the 5th season of the 1980s series The A-Team. In film, gunman Lee in The Magnificent Seven (a role he kind-of reprised in Battle Beyond the Stars), Major Paul Krueger in The Bridge at Remagen, the voice of Proteus IV, the computer villain of Demon Seed, Walter Chalmers in Bullitt, Ross Webster in Superman III, and war veteran Chester A. Gwynn in The Young Philadelphians which earned him a 1960 Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

Robert was a true gent and will be greatly missed.
