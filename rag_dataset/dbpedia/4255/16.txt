Charles Pfizer born in 1824 in Württemberg came to America with his cousin Charles Erhart in 1848. Pfizer was a chemist and Erhart a grocer.

In 1849 Pfizer and Erhart started a chemical company near the Town of Williamsburgh in what is now New York City's Borough of Brooklyn. They took over an existing red brick building at Harrison Ave and Bartlett Street.

In 1849 the Pfizer company rolled out its first product — a product made from santonin to treat intestinal worms.
