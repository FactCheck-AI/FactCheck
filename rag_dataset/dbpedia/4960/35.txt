Maksim Chmerkovskiy has announced that he is leaving Dancing with the Stars.

The dance professional confirmed to The New York Post that he will not renew his contract with the ABC series when it expires at the end of 2013.

"What else do I have to do there after 15 seasons? It makes total sense [to leave]," Chmerkovskiy said of appearing on Dancing with the Stars since its second season in 2006.

He added: "The audience can't expect for me to want to stick around, and the producers can't expect for me to want to stick around... Essentially, 80% of our job is to give somebody another push in their career. Or we make them into likable characters.

"At the end of the day, they go off and they better themselves. I loved doing it. But to be honest with you, at 32, I am at what-about-me time."

Chmerkovskiy will apparently focus on acting and also landing a reality television deal once he officially departs Dancing with the Stars.

However, he will be a part of the new All-Stars season as a partner to Kirstie Alley, with whom he originally placed second in season 12.

The dancer said of their chances to win this season: "We may have had a couple of weeks last time that we cruised on popularity or fan appeal or whatever.

"I am not really sure that is going to work for us this time. I am not sure people are going to vote for us just because it is us."

Chmerkovskiy has made it to the Dancing with the Stars grand final four times in the past, ended up as runner-up twice and third place on two other occasions.

Dancing with the Stars: All-Stars premieres on Monday, September 24 on ABC.
