Dr Savage said: "My wife, Natalie, and I have both been incredibly happy at Alleyn’s, and in Dulwich, and it is a real wrench to move on after what will be ten wonderful and rewarding years. Alleyn’s is a really amazing school, with lovely, positive and engaged students who are supported, cherished and inspired by a passionately committed and talented teaching and support staff."

"I shall miss them all, very much, as I move on with pride and joy, but inevitably some poignancy, to Westminster. I do so safe in the knowledge that the brilliant team at Alleyn’s – and its deep-rooted culture and ethos – will ensure a continuity of care as the new Head is found and appointed. I have no doubt that Alleyn’s will attract a superb field of talented people to the role: as we all know, it’s a great school to join and a tough place to leave!"
