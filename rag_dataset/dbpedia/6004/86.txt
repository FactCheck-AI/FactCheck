Unofficially (recorded by the private weather service Meteomedia)

41.2°C (106.2°F) at Brauneberg-Juffer weather station, August 11, 1998

-45.9°C (-50.6°F) at Funtensee-Wolfgang Gröbl weather station, December 24th 2001

Official by the German meteorological service (DWD)

40.2°C (104.4°F) in Gärmersdorf, July 27th 1983; Karlsruhe (3 times); Freiburg (Breisgau), August 13th 2003; March, August 13th 2003.

In my opinion its a bit strange that this temperature was officially reached several times and even three times in Karlsruhe itself (July 27th, 2013, August 9th 2003, August 13th 2003).

I guess there must have been some about 41°C readings as well in Germany especially in the hot summer of 2003.

Officially lowest is -37.8°C (-36.0°F) in Hüll recorded at February 12th 1929.
