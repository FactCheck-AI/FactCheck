Representatives from Scottish development group VIS Entertainment have announced that they will be closing the London development studio the company acquired from BAM! Entertainment just last year. The move follows the closure of a number of other unrelated London studios and the company’s own studio on the Isle of Wight. It is hoped that most of the dozen or so developers can be relocated to either of the company’s remaining Scottish studios.
