A well-loved German book created by Waldemar Bonsels, which was made into an Animated Adaptation, as well as a live action film. Starring live insects.

Maya the Bee follows the life of Maya, a honeybee and her friends Willy, also a honeybee, and Flip, a grasshopper.

The animated The Adventures of Maya the Honeybee is probably the best-known incarnation. It was originally created in Japan between 1975 and 1979 with a total of 107 episodes, but only 65 of these were ever broadcast in North America during its run in the early 90s (and even then, some of those were taken from the later "New Adventures..." series). The series itself has been dubbed into over 40 languages all around the world and has even spawned a number of video games.

The premise of the anime was that Maya was tasked to collect pollen for her hive, but she ended up doing such a good job that she gathered all of the pollen around her hive, and there was none left. The queen bee then sent Maya further away from the hive in search of more pollen.

A computer-animated TV adaptation, with Andrea Libman in the title role, aired between 2012 and 2017.

Tropes used in Maya the Bee include:
