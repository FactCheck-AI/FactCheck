Welcome to City Life Houston. We're a diverse, nondenominational church in Houston, TX. Imagine that in a city with millions of people and a vast sea of cyberspace YOU landed here. We believe that's no accident!

In whatever you are facing, please know you are not alone. Our Unhinged Prayer Ministry Team faithfully reads and prays over every prayer request and praise report!
