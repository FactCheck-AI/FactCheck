The 25,000 watt (daytime) station in Huntington has apparently dropped the awful programming from Overcomer Ministry, which featured the deceased Brother Stair. In its place is Omega Radio. It offers brokered religious programming for the Caribbean community. Its schedule also shows news programming from BBC, and other sources.

They mention that they are also on 100.7 FM in New York. Anyone know where that is located?

Omega Radio

WNYH has a translator on 100.7 W264DG Islip. If they're promoting it as being heard in New York itself there's very little chance of that happening. The programming originates in Jamaica (the island not Queens) and is also heard on an LPFM in Fort Lauderdale.

WHUD 100.7 Peekskill is receivable in a large swath of Long Island, as their signal is quite powerful. Wouldnâ€™t they complain about co-channel interference?

You can only complain about co-channel interference in your protected contour. For WHUD, almost none of Long Island itself is in the protected contour. Also, arguably, because no one lives in Long Island Sound, any interference that may occur of shore could be considered irrelevant by the FCC.

Assuming W264DG is operating with its licensed directional antenna, a complaint would just be a waste of lawyer fees.
