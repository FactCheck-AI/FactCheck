Heiress. German born Freiin (Baroness), socialite, fashion icon and jet set member of the 1950s and 1960s. She was a member of the International Best Dressed List since 1970. Born Dolores Maria Agatha Wilhelmine Luise, Freiin von Fürstenberg-Herdringen on 31 July 1936 in Berlin-Charlottenburg. She is the second daughter of Franz-Egon Maria Meinhard Engelbert Pius Aloysius Kaspar Ferdinand Dietrich, 3rd Graf von Fürstenberg-Herdringen (1896–1975) and his second wife, socialite Gloria Guinness (1912–1980). She had a younger brother, Franz-Egon, and a stepsister, Betsy von Furstenberg, from her father's previous marriage. Though some published sources have described Dolores von Fürstenberg as a countess and a princess, she is, in fact, a Freiin (baroness) by birth, according to the last published issue of the Almanach de Gotha. Children of the counts von Fürstenberg-Hedringen are known as Freiherr (baron) or Freiin (baroness), and the sons move up in rank to Graf (count) only if they inherit the primary title.

At age 19, she married her stepbrother, Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931–1965), son of Loel Guinness, on 22 October 1955 in Paris. Patrick was killed in a car accident in Turtig (near Raron, Switzerland) in 1965. Their children were Maria Alexandra Guinness Cook (born 1956; married Foulques, Count de Quatrebarbes in 1979; they later divorced but had issue); Loel Patrick Guinness (born 1957); Victoria Christina (born 1960; married Philip Niarchos in 1984, son of late Greek billionaire Stavros Niarchos; had issue).

After becoming a widow, Dolores sought to marry Karim Aga Khan, the son of Joan Barbara Yarde-Buller (1908–1997) by her marriage to Aly Khan (1911–1960), but nothing came of that.

Dolores was often seen on the pages of Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Town and Country, and Life magazines, adorned in designer clothes by Givenchy, Christian Dior, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga during the 1950s and 1960s, photographed by Cecil Beaton, Bert Stern, Henry Clarke, Mark Shaw, Richard Avedon and William Klein. She often appeared on the International Best Dressed List during these years.
