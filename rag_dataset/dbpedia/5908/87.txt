TOKYO -- Japanese railway and hotel operator Seibu Holdings is selling its construction unit for about 40 billion yen ($357 million) in an effort to buttress its finances amid the COVID-induced travel slump, Nikkei has learned.

The move comes amid sluggish demand for commuting and vacationing due to prolonged COVID restrictions.
