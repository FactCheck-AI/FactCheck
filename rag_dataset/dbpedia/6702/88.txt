The Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann (1874-1952) was president of the

World Zionist Organization and first president of the state of Israel.

Chaim Weizmann, son of Oizer and Rachel Weizmann, was born on Nov. 2,

1874, in Motele, Russia. After receiving a religious education, Chaim

was admitted to the gymnasium of Pinsk, where he continued his Hebraic

studies. At the age of 18, he received his baccalaureate. He majored

in chemistry at the universities of Darmstadt and Berlin, and he

received his doctor of science degree from the University of Freiburg

in 1900. From 1900 to 1904 Weizmann was a lecturer in chemistry at the

University of Geneva and from 1904 to 1916 a lecturer in biochemistry

at the University of Manchester.

While in Switzerland, Weizmann joined the active Zionist leadership.

He participated in all Zionist congresses after 1898 and was a

delegate after 1901. He urged a synthesis of settlement, cultural

work, and political propaganda to secure international recognition of

Zionist goals in Palestine. He opposed the British proposal for Jewish

settlement in Uganda. As an exponent of cultural Zionism, Weizmann

suggested the creation of a Hebrew University in Palestine. The

university opened in Jerusalem in 1925. In appreciation of his efforts

in building the university, he was elected its honorary president.

During World War I, Weizmann, because of his connections with British

authorities, emerged as the leader of the Zionist movement.

As a result of his efforts, the British government issued on Nov. 2,

1917, the Balfour Declaration, in which it declared its support of the

establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine. As the head of a

Jewish delegation, Weizmann appeared before the Paris Peace Conference

in 1919 and submitted the Zionist claims to Palestine. These claims

were recognized by the League of Nations, and the British government

was appointed to further Jewish settlement and to assist the

development of a Jewish national home there.

In 1921 Weizmann was elected president of the World Zionist

Organization, a post he held until 1931 and later from 1935 to 1946.

When the Jewish Agency for Palestine was established in 1929, he

served simultaneously as its president. In this dual capacity, he

cooperated with Great Britain except for a time in 1930, when he

resigned from his Zionist post in protest against the new British

policy curtailing Jewish immigration to Palestine. After 1946, in

spite of his unofficial position, Weizmann served with the Jewish

Agency's delegation before the United Nations Special Committee for

Palestine in October 1947. When Israel was proclaimed an independent

state, he was elected the president of its Provisional Council of

State. After the elections to the Parliament, he was elected, on Feb.

17, 1949, as Israel's first president, and he was reelected on Nov.

19, 1951.

In addition to his political activity, Weizmann also engaged in

scholarly scientific work. He founded the Sief Research Institute in

Rehovoth and served as its director from 1932 to 1952. This institute

was later enlarged and named the Weizmann Institute of Science.
