The guided-missile destroyer USS Sterett is scheduled to return to Naval Base San Diego Thursday following a deployment to the Middle East and western Pacific, Navy officials announced today.

USS Sterett, as part of the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group, took part in five multinational exercises and maritime security operations missions in the western Pacific, Indian Ocean and Middle Eastern regions, Navy officials said.

Sterett is the fourth United States ship named for Lt. Andrew Sterett, who commanded the Enterprise in battle with the Barbary pirates in 1802. The Sterett, commanded by Cmdr. Rich McDaniel, also conducted counter-piracy operations during its deployment, Navy officials said.
