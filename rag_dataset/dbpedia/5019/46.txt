70mm Blowup with Magnetic Sound from Sony Pictures Repertory

Adapted from Kazuo Ishiguro's novel, Merchant-Ivory's exquisite follow-up to HOWARDS END reunites Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins in another understated and adult romance. A tale of compromise and complicity in interwar England, THE REMAINS OF THE DAY follows housekeeper Miss Kenton (Thompson) as she waits for unflappable head butler Stevens (Hopkins) to think above his station and express his feelings while their employer Lord Darlington (James Fox) pursues a separate peace with Nazi Germany. The only Merchant-Ivory production to receive a 70mm release, REMAINS OF THE DAY shows the team's typical attention to costume design, set decoration, and period detail to its best advantage in this lovely blowup.
