Santiago Matías, Alofoke, born in El Capotillo, Distrito Nacional, Dominican Republic, began his career in music and quickly became a prominent figure in the Dominican rap scene. In 2006, noticing the lack of media coverage for urban music in the Dominican Republic, he founded AlofokeMusic, a media group dedicated exclusively to covering urban music artists.
