Medals awarded to a World War II pilot who risked his life to drop the French Tricolour over the Arc de Triomphe in occupied Paris in 1942 have been sold for Â£41,000 at auction.

Wing Commander Ken Gatward, who lived in Essex, flew his Bristol Beaufighter down the Champs-Elysees in the operation to boost French morale.

Colchester auctioneers Reeman Dansie expected the medals would make Â£8,000.

But the collection made more than five times that figure.

The items were being auctioned following the death of Wing Cdr Gatward's widow.

They had lived near Frinton-on-Sea and Wing Cdr Gatward died in 1998, aged 84.

In a Bristol Beaufighter of RAF Coastal Command, Wing Cdr Gatward and his crew flew over the main streets of the capital at the level of third-floor windows.

People in the Champs-Elysees watched as the French Tricolour streamed from the fuselage of the aircraft and floated down on to the Arc de Triomphe.
