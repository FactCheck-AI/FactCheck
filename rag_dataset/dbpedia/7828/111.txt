The star confirmed the news on Instagram with a picture of her ring, which she captioned: â€œI usually do not discuss my personal life but to stop the speculation I want to share my happy news... Jean-Bernard and I married on 7/7/14.

Cheryl has also insisted that her new moniker is used on 'The X Factor', although it is believed her old surname will still be used on the artwork for her new single 'Crazy Stupid Love', as it was too late to change.
