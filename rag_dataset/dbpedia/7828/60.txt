Cheryl has let go of the last vestige of her marriage with ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.

The singer is still often referred to as 'Cheryl Fernandez-Versini' even though she officially separated from Jean-Bernard three years ago, and is now in a relationship with ex-One Direction star Liam Payne â€“ with whom she has a son named Bear.

And new documents have confirmed that she is officially 'Cheryl Tweedy' again. As reported by The Sun, the singer is now signing off paperwork for her company CC Couture with her original name.

'Tweedy' is, of course, Cheryl's maiden name and the one most fans knew her by when she first rose to fame as a member of Girls Aloud.

Her surname changed both privately and professionally when she married footballer Ashley Cole, and then again when she got together with Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini. Cheryl split from Jean-Bernard in 2014, with the couple divorcing last autumn.

Liam had previously confirmed to BBC Radio 1Xtra that Cheryl was reverting back to 'Tweedy'.

Asked whether it annoys him to hear his girlfriend still referred to as 'Cheryl Fernandez-Versini' or 'Cheryl Cole' in the press, he said: "Her name is officially Cheryl Tweedy now, but to be honest it doesn't really bother me. We have a kid together, there's a lot more to our life."
