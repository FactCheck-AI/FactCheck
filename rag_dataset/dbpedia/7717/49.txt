The Gibson Flying V

The Gibson Flying V is a distinctive electric guitar known for its V-shaped body design. The design was the brainchild of then-Gibson president Ted McCarty, in an effort to update, modernize and generate interest in Gibson electric guitars. In the late 1950s, futuristic styling abounded and Gibson looked for ways to capitalize on it. In this article we cover the history of the Gibson Flying V.

Introduction in the 1950s:

The Gibson Flying V was introduced in 1958 as part of Gibson's Modernistic series, along with the Explorer and the Moderne.

The design was unconventional and futuristic for its time, featuring a V-shaped body with sharp angles and a pointed headstock.

Popular in automotive design at the time were pointed tailfins, which the guitar shape echoed.

Initial Reception:

The initial reaction to the Flying V was mixed. Some players found the design too radical, while others appreciated its unique and edgy look.

The shape made playing in a sitting position difficult; a rubberized strip added on the edge of the lower bout aimed with limited success to solve it. Most players opted to rest the crotch of the V over the thigh when seated.

Despite its innovative design, the Flying V initially struggled to gain popularity, and, after production of just under 100 units, was discontinued in 1959.

Resurgence in the 1960s:

In the late 1960s, the Flying V gained popularity among rock and blues players, and its distinctive shape became associated with the emerging hard rock and heavy metal genres.

Guitarists such as Albert King and Lonnie Mack were among the early adopters of the Flying V, contributing to its growing reputation.

Reissue and Reintroduction:

Due to increasing demand, Gibson reintroduced the Flying V in the mid-1960s. However, production numbers were still relatively low compared to other Gibson models.

In the 1970s, Gibson began reissuing the Flying V with slight modifications, and it started gaining more recognition.

Popularity in the 1980s and Beyond:

The 1980s saw a surge in popularity for the Flying V, especially among heavy metal guitarists. Iconic players like Dave Mustaine of Megadeth and Kirk Hammett of Metallica contributed to the guitar's popularity in the metal scene.

Gibson produced various versions and signature models of the Flying V over the years, catering to different player preferences.

Continued Legacy:

The Flying V has continued to be a popular choice among guitarists across various genres, including hard rock, metal, blues, and even jazz.

Gibson regularly releases new variations and limited-edition models of the Flying V to cater to the diverse tastes of modern players.
