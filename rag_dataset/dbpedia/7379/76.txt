Actor Born Oct. 1, 1950 in Houston, TX

Character actor Randy Quaid has played the gamut of rangy rednecks, underachievers and shifty types in a busy career that began in 1971âs âThe Last Picture Showâ and took off a few years later with his Oscar- and Golden Globe-nominated role as a virginal young sailor in âThe Last Detail.â

Some of his most memorable feature performances include Cousin Eddie in âNational Lampoonâs Vacationâ and âChristmas Vacation,â Amish bowler Ishmael in the Farrelly brothersâ âKingpin,â crop duster Russell Casse in âIndependence Dayâ and intolerant rancher Joe Aguirre in âBrokeback Mountain.â

Quaidâs many TV appearances include playing Mitch in a 1984 remake of âA Streetcar Named Desireâ (Emmy nomination), the title role in the 1987 NBC movie âLBJ: The Early Yearsâ (Emmy nomination, Golden Globe award), and Colonel Tom Parker in the 2005 CBS miniseries âElvisâ (Emmy and Golden Globe nominations). He also spent a season on âSaturday Night Liveâ from 1985 to 1986.

Quaid has a daughter, Ella, from his first wife, Amanda. He and second wife Evi (married since 1989) have two adopted children, Charlotte and Kaki.
