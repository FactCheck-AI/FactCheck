Nashville’s far from Texas, but anyplace can be home if you’re with the folks you love, you dig?

In under a year we’d seen just over fifty bands up to the point where we met the Kopecky Family Band at SXSW. All fifty or so were different, they all interacted different, they were all strange sordid families of some type. Not by blood, not in some cases even by love, but, by the chance of meeting and the chance of having the same dream, and by the chance of finding a melding of sounds that they believe makes sense of that.

The Kopecky Family Band is of that same dream. Six of them coming together in unison to find harmony. A family by the birth of songs. It works really well.

They carried those familial vibes through the van. Left us these three offerings, and then set off as a group again, off to a next show, a next highway, a next stage. Together.
