Active Kids Bondi is a childcare centre located in a beautiful, quiet street just a short walk from the world famous Bondi Beach in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs.

Our day care centre in Bondi is open Monday to Friday from 7.00am – 6.00pm. Active Kids Bondi has a wonderful outdoor environment that is natural and spacious which offers stimulating learning experiences for each individual child. Each age group has their own outdoor area including a roof top play area for our Preschoolers. Our Indoor environments are well lit with natural light and our facility is full of natural resources. Our childcare centre is well structured, inviting, warm, tidy, and clean.

Our team of strong, experienced, and highly qualified educators take pride in supporting each child to unlock their potential and passion for learning.

We offer an educational program for children from 8 weeks – 5 years old. Our program is based on the Early Years Learning Framework curriculum and physical activity program, which includes Munch and Move. Our Learn and Grow program gives the children at Bondi the opportunity to participate in weekly Drama and Dance, Fitness and French lessons.

We are proud to have an experienced child care chef who provides all meals which are prepared and cooked on site inclusive of breakfast, morning tea, lunch, afternoon tea and dinner. The meals are carefully prepared, and we cater for each individuals dietary requirements.

In addition, we provide baby formula for our Nursery age children.

A school readiness and transition to school program is also provided to our Preschool children.
