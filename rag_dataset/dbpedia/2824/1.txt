Like many Dubliners, I love the Grattan Bridge which connects Parliament Street to Capel Street. The bridge includes beautiful representations of the mythical hippocampus (half horse, half fish) in its lamp designs, not unlike the figures that appear in the lamps at the Grattan monument on College Green and at the Vartry Reservoir.

Grattan Bridge is also somewhere you can just sit down and take things in for a while, with a series of benches. Passing it yesterday on a rainy day, I noticed a funny little addition to one such bench:

It brought to mind a few other such interventions in the city over the years, most famously of course the Father Pat Noise plaque on Oâ€™Connell Bridge, placed in the spot where the control box for the ill-fated Millennium Clock had once been.

Anyway, thanks to those responsible! Such people brighten up life in this city.
