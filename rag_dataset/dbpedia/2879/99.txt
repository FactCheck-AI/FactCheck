Jade, the heroine of the original Beyond Good and Evil, will play a major role in the next game, Ubisoft said. Originally, Beyond Good and Evil 2 was said to take place before Jade was born, but instead a “ferocious young Jade” will appear in the game’s storyline.

The long-awaited follow-up to Ubisoft’s critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful 2003 action-adventure-photography game made its last appearance at Ubisoft’s E3 conference last year.

It will actually be a prequel to the events of the first game, in which players will create their own character and explore an open-world outer-space environment. But characters like Jade and pig-friend Pey’j will factor in heavily to the game’s story, its developers said at Ubisoft’s E3 press conference today.

Here’s the cinematic trailer shown at E3, in which Jade shows up.

Ubisoft showed a bit of “pre-alpha” gameplay of the still-in-development game, but said that the demo would be “behind closed doors” at E3.
