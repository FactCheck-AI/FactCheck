45 Players and Staff From KHL Lokomotiv Yaroslavl Perished in a Plane Crash 5 Years Ago Today, Marking One of the Darkest Days in Hockey History

Team Russia’s World Cup of Hockey squad paid tribute to KHL Lokomotiv Yaroslavl today with a moment of silence at center ice during practice to honor the fallen. It was five years ago when we lost 45 players and staff in a deadly plane crash that sent shock-waves through the hockey world.

The KHL has made it a tradition since the tragedy not to schedule games on September 7th, and according to the league, there never will be. It’s a classy way for the Kontinental Hockey League to ensure we never forget the devastating event that took place a half decade ago.

There were initially two survivors from the plane crash, but unfortunately one of them died a few days later in hospital. Here is a full list of those 45 players and staff (list courtesy of Sportsnet.ca):
