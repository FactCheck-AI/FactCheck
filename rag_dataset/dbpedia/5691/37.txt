There are no games scheduled in the KHL today. The league says there never will be games scheduled on Sept. 7.

This date gives us a sombre reminder of how fragile life is, as we lost an entire KHL team in the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash on Sept. 7, 2011. While there are no games being played in Russia’s top professional league today, the Russian World Cup of Hockey team is on the ice at camp. They started today’s session off with a moment of silence to honour the fallen.

There were 45 people aboard the Lokomotiv flight and although two initially survived the crash, one of those survivors died in hospital a few days later.

The following is a list of players and staff who died on the Lokomotiv flight.
