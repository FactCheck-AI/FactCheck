The mountain village of Santâ€™Antonio di Gallura is located in the heart of the Gallura area at an altitude of 357 metres, not too far from the sandy beaches of the Costa Smeralda. The hilly landscape is filled with cork oaks and olive trees. The rivers Rio di Piatu and Fiume Liscia both lead to the Liscia lake. With a bit of luck you can spot wild boars, foxes, hares and falcons during a hike through the area.
