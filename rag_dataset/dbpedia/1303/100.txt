MARY NEAL

JERSEYVILLE - Mary (Fitzgibbons) Neal, 65, died Thursday, December 17, 2020 at St. Lukes Des Peres Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.

She was born in Jerseyville on January 30, 1955, the second of four children born to Edward Leo and Mary Louise "Lois" (Young) Fitzgibbons.

She was a 1973 graduate of Jersey Community High School, and previously had worked at BP Amoco Refinery in Wood River. Her passion, however, was that of being a devoted, loving and supportive wife, mother, grandmother, daughter and sister. She was the perfect farmers wife, working alongside her husband Randy, on the family farm, with no chore being unaccomplished. She was there for her family in every way imaginable, and later in life, assumed the role of Grandma, like no other.

She married Randy Neal on August 25, 1973 at the Hope Lutheran Church in Jerseyville and together they have been blessed with 47 years of marriage.

Surviving are her husband, Randy Neal of Jerseyville; a son, Joshua Neal of Jerseyville; a daughter and son in-law, Amber and Nathan Wilson of Jerseyville; five grandchildren, Marcus and Andrew "AJ" Neal and Lily, Drake and Lucy Wilson; a sister, Theresa Fitzgibbons of Jerseyville; and two brothers and a sister in-law, Michael and Kim Fitzgibbons and Mark Fitzgibbons, all of Jerseyville; along with nieces and nephews.

In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her father in-law and mother in-law, Clifford and Vera Neal.
