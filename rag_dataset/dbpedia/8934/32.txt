Corrosion of Conformity (Also known as C.O.C.) are an American heavy metal band originating from Raleigh, North Carolina. Forming in 1982 by Mike Dean, Woody Weatherman and Reed Mullin. Performing initially as a hardcore punk band with a rotating set of lead singers, the band would evolve into crossover thrash by the time of 1985's "Animosity". However with one Pepper Keenan joining in 1989 the band's sound drastically shifted into a heavy metal sound with elements of southern groove, sludge and doom.

With the release of 1991's "Blind" the band attracted the attention of Colombia Records, who released the 1994 album "Deliverance", which peaked at number 155 on the Billboard 200 and spawned the hits "Albatross" and "Clean My Wounds". Their 1996 follow-up "Wiseblood" was also successful, and became Corrosion of Conformity's highest-charting album in the United States, peaking at number 104 on the Billboard 200. The band would keep consistently active until 2006. COC would re-form in 2010 as a trio without Pepper Keenan as he would be busy with Down and release two albums as a trio. Pepper Keenan would re-join in December 2014 and release "No Cross, No Crown" in 2018.

To date Corrosion of Conformity have released ten studio albums among EPs, a live album and various singles. The band in both tenures had been a strong touring unit, sharing the stage with a wide arrangement of bands and some of the biggest names in metal.

History[]

Early years, Eye For An Eye and Animosity (1982 – 1988)[]

Corrosion of Conformity was formed in Raleigh, North Carolina by the trio of Mike Dean, Woody Weatherman, Reed Mullin and Benji Shelton. Originally known as Accused the quartet, then played hardcore punk and did a show on 15 August 1982 at Orchard Apts. Clubhouse under that name. Shortly after the band renamed themselves as Corrosion of Conformity and participated in the No Core Split with No Labels, No Rock Stars and Colcor. The band performed for the first time under the COC name that September. Along with their label contemporaries the band performed with the likes of Husker Du, Circle Jerks, Graven Image, Scream, Agnostic Front, Suicidal Tendencies and The Dead Kennedys among other punk and hardcore bands. By the time of the next No Core Records split release Why Are We Here? (With Bloodmobile, Stillborn Christians and No Labels) the band would attain a new singer in Eric Eycke.

Recording with David Mahon at Hummingbird Sound, Raleigh, North Carolina in 1983, COC would compose their debut album in a blistering set of twenty songs in thirty-six minutes. With minor delays Eye For An Eye would be released in the Spring of 1984, an album that has seen retroactive praise for it's ferocity.[1][2][3] The band would tour around the United States to support the album, sharing the stage with the likes of Negative Approach, Black Flag, D.R.I., BL'AST!, Ugly Americans, Reptile House, Saccharine Trust, Slayer and The Obsessed just to name a few. The band also notably participated in a "Battle of the Bands" show in 1984 that was mistaken for a riot by the crowd's reaction and band's mannerisms, leading to Ecyke getting arrested.[4]

Eycke would leave the band sometime after the release of Eye For An Eye, leaving Weatherman and Dean to share vocal duties as work began on a second album, working with Bill Metoyer at Track Record in Los Angeles and with David Schmitt at Hummingbird Sound in Raleigh. Eddy Schreyer would master this album and legendary punk artist Brian "Pushead" Schroeder would provide the album cover.

With ten songs in twenty-six minutes, Animosity would see release on 25 October 1985 and evolve the band's sound into crossover thrash.[5][6] Corrosion of Conformity would tour with Dirty Rotten Imbeciles that November and then tour the United States again the next Spring. The ban dwould recruit a new singer in Simon Bob Sinister after the breakup of their fellow Carolina band and Death Records labelmates Ugly Americans. Following touring all over the United States and recording an EP in September 1986 Technocracy would see release via Metal Blade Records, featuring the hectic crossover thrash musicianship of COC with a cleaner vocal style than they had in the past. The band would tour extensively throughout the United States and sharing the stage with the likes of Melvins, 7 Seconds, Honor Role, SNFU, Dag Nasty, Gore and many others. However following a short tour with The Ramones in February 1988 both Mike Death and Simon Bob would leave the band, leaving Corrosion of Conformity essenntially on a hiatus.

The remaining members would search for a new vocalist, even posting a classified in Flipside Fanzine searching for a singer similar to "James Hetfield or Ozzy Osbourne" to compliment the heavy metal direction they were slowly embracinga heavy metal direction. Mike Dean would be largely out of music but would participate in a side project known as Snake Nation, with Woody Weatherman and Brian Walsby. Caroline Records would release an EP of recordings from 1985 entitled Six Songs With Mike Singing on 27 January 1989.

Blind, Deliverance and Wiseblood (1989 – 1998)[]

After searching around the band would find a new vocalist in Karl Agell (School of Violence, Seizure). Along with Agell the band would recruit bassist Phil Swisher (Blood Bath, Unicef) and a second guitarist in Pepper Keenan (Graveyard Rodeo). The first show with this lineup would be on 30 July 1989 at the Cat's Cradle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina (With Honor Role). A short tour with Bad Brains would immediately follow. The next year would see the band performing a string of shows in Canada followed by their first ever tour of Europe (Alongside D.R.I.). The band would return to the United States to tour with Danzig and Soundgarden that August.

This new quintet would solidify the band's sound into a more straightforward heavy metal direction, with hints of sludge metal and groove metal. The band would eventually record in early 1991 at Baby Monster Studios in New York, following a tour of Florida. Signing to Relativity Records and releasing singles for "Dance of The Dead", "Future Now" and "Vote With a Bullet", Blind would see release on 5 November 1991 and breaking out in the heavy metal scene. Along with positive reception (Such as Entertainment Weekly awarding the album an "A" score)[7] the album managed to peak at #34 on the Heatseekers charts and sell well over 200,000 copies.

Corrosion of Conformity would tour the United States with Prong and Bullet Lavolta in support of Blind, followed by a Winter tour the next year sharing the stage with the likes of Tool, Dead Surf Kiss, Cannibal Corpse and future tour mates in Clutch. The band would also return to Europe in the Spring of 1992 as support for Soundgarden, followed by more touring and an appearance at Dyanmo Festival that Summer. Tours with Iron Maiden, Testament, Rollins Band, Prong and Mordred would round out the rest of 1992. Karl Agell and Phil Swisher would both leave the band in early 1993 to form Leadfoot, their last show with the band on 22 December 1992 at The Music Hall in Frankfurt, Germany.

Corrosion of Conformity would take a year off from touring to concentrate on their next album. Mike Dean would return to the band and Pepper Keenan would take over the lead vocal role on Mike Dean's suggestion.[8] The band recorded through 1993 going into 1994, their sound evolving into more southern and stoner rock. Signing to Columbia Records, Deliverance would see release on 27 September 1994, peaking at #155 on the Billboard 200 with two hit singles in "Albatross" and "Clean My Wounds" (Both peaking at #19 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks). Two of the album's songs would feature in movies: "Big Problems" was featured on the soundtrack for Clerks while "Clean My Wounds" was featured in Tekken: The Motion Picture.

Deliverance would prove to be the band's biggest selling album with it's two hit singles, spending nearly four months on the Billboard 200. On the Heatseekers charts it spent nearly a year there and peaked at #5. Overall the album had sold over 400,000 copies by the 2000s. In an interview with Thrasher Magazine, Pepper Keenan would explain joining the band, taking over the lead vocal role and recording Deliverance:

“ "[On joining COC] In ’89. We were all friends and they were looking for a singer. I knew this girl who knew them and she was, like, “You should go up there and try out.” At the time, I was a band in New Orleans called Graveyard Rodeo. So I went up there and hung out for a while. I ended up joining the band as second guitar player and we did a record called Blind in 1991. That was some crazy shit. I ended up singing a song on it called “Vote With A Bullet,” and it kind of took off from there. Then we did the next album, which was Deliverance. It was recorded for this little record label—Relativity Records—on a tiny budget.

[On recording Deliverance and the southern rock sound] We started recording it and we knew we were onto something. It started going in a certain direction once Columbia Records got a hold of it. So we ended up looking for singers, and then Mike Dean came back into the band. He was all, “Dude, why don’t you do it?” and I was, like, “Shit. Yeah, I guess so.”

The way we were thinking back then, the hardcore thing was getting so stale. It seemed that everyone was doin’ the same fuckin’ thing, and for us to write the song “The Albatross” felt more punk rock than anything anyone was doing at the time. People were pissed off at us. But it finally felt real again. We were just evolving as musicians."

”

— Pepper Keenan, Thrasher Magazine [9]

Corrosion of Conformity would tour North America and Europe from October - December that year to support Deliverance, followed by touring North America, South America, Europe and Israel through 1995 with Megadeth. Following summer touring with Monster Magnet and returning to England for two shows with Metallica. Following those shows work would begin on a fifth studio album, even attaining James Hetfield for backing vocals on the song "Man or Ash".

Working again with producer John Custer, Wiseblood would see release on 15 October 1996, peaking at #104 on the Billboard 200, their highest position on the chart for 22 years. The band also peaked at #2 on the Heatseekers chart and produced a hit in "Drowning in a Daydream", which would peak at #27 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks[10] and earn a Grammy nomination for Best Metal Performance in 1998.[11] However the album saw relatively mixed reviews and sold just over 150,000 copies, thus not as successful as it's predecessors. Corrosion of Conformity would embark on a world tour with Metallica to support Wiseblood through 1996 going into 1997. The band also toured with the likes of Drain and Fu Manchu through the next year as well.

In an interview with Ultimate Classic Rock, Pepper Keenan would speak about the recording process of Wiseblood, the complications with Columbia Records and how a secretary got them nominated for a Grammy Award:

“ "We were pretty on point. We had just finished doing a bunch of touring and we did some of the shit at Criteria, we did some of the stuff in New Orleans, we finished at Electric Lady in New York,” he told UCR in a 2015 interview. “It was a strong record, man. It’s still one of my favorites. And the way it sounds is pretty brutal as well.

[On Drowning in a Daydream] I’ll tell you the God’s honest truth. We turned the record in and that song was not on the record. Donnie Ienner, the president of Columbia at the time said that he didn’t hear a hit on that album, which I thought he was crazy. But it was just an abrasive sounding record, so he didn’t hear a hit. He wanted us to write a song with like some songwriter dude who wrote Aerosmith songs or some shit and we were like, "Fuck that! You want a fuckin’ hit? I’ll give you a fuckin’ hit."

We went back in the studio and wrote "Drowning In a Daydream" in two days, recorded it and sent it back to him. We put it on the record and he still wasn’t convinced and then his secretary put it on the list for the Grammy nominations without telling anybody. We got nominated for a fuckin’ Grammy because of his secretary, which was very ironic. And it got tons of radio airplay, so, whatever. It’s a great song. I’m not a one-trick pony and nor does C.O.C. try to be. We’re writing songs. If you want to write a song, I’ll fuckin’ write something like "Stare Too Long" or whatever. I enjoy the challenge of that stuff. I like "Drowning In A Daydream" a lot. It’s always been one of my favorites.

[On producer John Custer] He’s just one of those guys who looks at ya and you know, after you’ve worked on something, he’s a fantastic musician and understands it psychologically and he’ll ask the simple question, "Is that what you hear in your head?" And if it’s not, we keep going until we get it. That’s all you can really ask for from a guy, a producer like that, of that caliber. And he doesn’t try and put his stamp on things. We don’t go around shaping the song, we just let it evolve."

”

America's Volume Dealer and In the Arms of God (1998 – 2006)[]

Soon after the release of Wiseblood, Columbia dropped COC, who then moved to Sanctuary Records. The band largely took time off the live stage, only performing on occasion through 1998 and 1999. The band would also work again with John Custer, recording and mixing their next album in 28 days at Jag recording Hut, The Pod, and The Wig Shoppe. After releasing a promo for "Over Me", the band would release America's Volume Dealer on 26 September 2000. Notably the album would peak at #18 on the Heatseekers charts and the single "Congratulations Song" would peak at #24 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks, the album itself sold only around 30,000 copies at the time of release. Retroactively the band would cite the album as "too slick sounding".[13]

Corrosion of Conformity would tour with Clutch that Fall to support the album but with a major change. It would be revealed that longtime drummer Reed Mullin would have to leave the band due to requiring back surgery (and even breaking his back and having it heal improperly).[14] Jimmy Bower (Eyehategod, Down) would fill in for the tour and through the next couple years, even appearing on the band's first live album Live Volume, released 7 August 2001. the band would tour with the likes of Clutch, The Mystick Crewe of Clearlight, Spirit Caravan and Nebula among others throughout 2001.

The band would work with a series of drummers alongside Bower, including local Raleigh percussion professor Merritt Partridge, Stanton Moore of Galactic and Reed's former drum technician Jason Patterson, who previously played drums in the Raleigh-based rock band Cry of Love. The band would take somewhat of a break in 2003 while Pepper Keenan would concentrate on Down,[15] while the band began work on their next album, initialy intending to call it The Unholy.[16] Re-signing with Sanctuary Records,[17] and confirming that Stanton Moore would play the drums on it.[18][19]

Initially intending to call the album En Los Brazos Del Dios, the album would instead go by it's translated English title: In The Arms of God. In The Arms of God would be released on 5 April 2005, peaking at #1 on the Heatseekers and #108 on the Billboard 200. In The Arms of God would attain widespread critical acclaim from the likes of Blabbermouth (10/10),[20] AntiMusic (4.5/5),[21] Metal Temple (10/10),[22] Sea of Tranquility (4.5/5),[23] Your Last Rites[24] and Pop Matters[25] just to name a few. Retroactively, Pepper Keenan would speak highly of the album and cite it among his finest works.[26]

Corrosion of Conformity would tour extensively to support In The Arms of God, touring with the likes of Motörhead,[27] Crowbar, Fu Manchu, Alabama Thunderpussy and Weedeater just to name a few. Tragically a stabbing would break out during one of their concerts in Ybor City, Florida on 23 June 2005.[28] A tour of Europe with Motörhead would be planned for the Fall, along with a Jagermeister tour with Disturbed, but Hurricane Katrina would strike New Orleans on 23 August 2005. The European tour would be postponed and the band would opt out of the Disturbed tour a week early.[29] The band later cited the tour as a regrettable decision,[30] though Disturbed frontman Daved Draiman expressed that he understood their decision.[31]

Corrosion of Conformity would tour with Clutch and Stinking Lizaveta the next year. Despite hinting at new material the band would essentially go on hiatus in the Spring of 2006. Pepper Keenan would keep busy touring with Down. Karl Agell and Reed Mullin occasionally performed with Jerry Barrett, Scott Little, and Jason Browning (Browning eventually replaced by TR Gwynne) as COC-Blind or simply Blind, performing the 1991 album.[32] Reed Mullin and Mike Dean along with Jason Browning are also touring in a new band called Righteous Fool, releasing a 7" single via Southern Lord Records and touring with Clutch.[33][34]

Animosity lineup reunion, Self-Titled Album and IX (2010 – 2014)[]

On 12 May 2010 it would be confirmed by Blabbermouth that the Animosity lineup of Corrosion of Conformity would reunite and begin work on a new album.[35] The band would focus on a trio lineup as Pepper remained with Down, though still listed him as an official member, while expressing interest in working with him again.[36] The band would tour the West Coast in the Fall of 2010, participating in The Power of The Riff and Riot Fest,[37] with several dates revisiting the entire Animosity album along with some fo the early hardcore cuts amid new songs.[38] Southern Lord Records would release a single entitled Your Tomorrow, the first recordings of the Animosity-era lineup in nearly 25 years.

In various interviews both Mike Dean and Woody Weatherman would speak about the Animosity reunion, Pepper Keenan and future plans:

“ "We actually have five new songs put together enough to perform now and the rest of it is kind of a work in progress. But creatively speaking, I think we're in a process where we're cranking out the music in a natural way and it's coming together. So I think in another couple of months we should be ready to record in earnest. I'm not sure if we're going to keep recording ourselves up there at the farm or we'll go to a fancier facility. I think we have our current take on our classic style in mind. We're definitely expanding on our past identity but we kind of have some new stuff to offer. So I'm excited about it. I want it to come together quickly without over-thinking it.

Well, the truth in that is we want to do a three-piece full-length recording and we're going to do it. But I think our next move after supporting that a little bit, will be to look toward changing it up again and depending on the schedule of DOWN and Pepper, doing something with him because I think people would be excited to hear that. I thought that "In The Arms Of God", the last recording that we did with him, was really amazing. I thought he had some good ideas and really enjoyed doing it. We didn't tour enough on it, partially because of DOWN's schedule and partially because our record company was in the process of going under, also the Hurricane Katrina striking at that time. It was bad for Pepper as he had to cancel some dates to get back to normal and all that. So we came out with a really good release but never got a chance to support it. Just the idea of expanding on what we were doing in "In The Arms Of God" and then bringing Reed back in to play drums, for me that would be really exciting."

”

— Mike Dean, Metal Assault [39]

“ "[On Pepper not being part of the reunion] It's kind of a weird way it came about. It was Pepper that stirred everybody's bones back into motion. He had brought us up, doing some things in Europe this summer. Then with [Reed] Mullin [drums] coming back in, being the original guy or whatever, that kind of fell through. Our cages had been rattled. Mullin came out of the shadows, so we kept on going with it. When the time is right, when Pepper is willing and everybody else is willing, we'll probably do more four-piece stuff later on. Bu this just seems like it's got some interest now, and we're rolling with it.

I think he agrees with Mike [Dean, bass/vocals] and Reed and myself. We've never shut the door on anything. I think it'd be cool to do this and then later go back and do another four-piece record. And last time I talked to Pepper, he kind of felt that way, too. So we'll see if that holds true in the months to come. I think it probably will. I think we've got another one of those C.O.C. records in us too.

[On the new material] It's faster. We've got about five or six songs we've been working on. It's pretty cool. Definitely not the same thing we've been doing over the last three or four records. It's probably reverting back to a little more old-school style. I wouldn't say it sounds [like "Animosity"], but it's leaning that way. [And] it's not like "Albatross" or anything.

[On COC-Blind] I'm really kinda having no comment on it. Reed claims that it's just something he did for the fun of it. It's kind of a weird deal. I think it would have been better if they'd have just called it "BLIND." They did their last little thing, and now that we're geared back up, doing some real shit, we're not going to fiddle with that any more."

”

— Woody Weatherman, Metalsucks [40]

Corrosion of Conformity would enter Studio 606 in Northridge, California initially in March and later in November.[41] Between the two studio visits the band would tour Europe through the Spring (Including appearances at Roadburn Festival and Maryland Deathfest) and Summer, along with a North American tour supporting Clutch. Former Snake Nation drummer and friend of the band Brian Walsby would also release his fifth issue of Manchild, covering the Raleigh scene and giving an extensive take on Corrosion of Conformity through the punk years and their reunion.[42] Pepper joined his band mates on stage on 17 June 2011 at Hellfest (Clisson, France) to play "Vote with a Bullet" as well as on 19 June 2011 in Bilbao (Spain) where they additionally performed together on "Señor Limpio".

The band would tour Australia for the first time in many years alongside Weedeater.[54] The band followed with a North American tour alongside BL'AST!, Brant Bjork and Lord Dying.[55] However Reed Mullin would sit out the tour due to rotator cuff surgery, with Eric Hernandez (Kylesa) filling in.[56]

Reunion with Pepper Keenan and No Cross, No Crown (2015 – Present)[]

On 2 September 2014 in an interview with Heavy Blog Is Heavy, Reed Mullin would confirm that Corrosion of Conformity would reunite with guitarist/vocalist Pepper Keenan to record a new album, along with touring.[57] Work began on a new album the next January[58] and announced a six-date tour of the United Kingdom, the first full shows with Keenan in nearly a decade. Further touring, along with the occasional COC-Blind performance,[59][60]

With plans to enter the studio, Corrosion of Conformity would sign with Nuclear Blast Records on 15 October 2015.[61] The band would tour extensively through 2016 but suffer a setback when Reed Mullin would suffer from seizures due to alcohol abuse during a North American tour,[62] with Chris Adler (Lamb of God) and Jean-Paul Gaster (Clutch) filling in. Reed would recover some days later and resume touring.[63] Through 2017 the band would appear at the Blackest of the Black Festival and Psycho Las Vegas, along with support for the likes of Danzig and Black Label Society. Working with longtime producer John Custer, Corrosion of Conformity would record their tenth album in 2017.

On 27 January 2020, while the band would be touring New Zealand and Australia, Reed Mullin would pass away aged 53.[74] Numerous musicians[75] and the band would offer tributes in his memory, citing him as a "bad-ass drummer":

“ "Reed could play all of the metal stuff, cymbal grabs, proto blast beats with only one bass pedal. He could cop one hundred different styles and reference them in his own way. Everything from Earl Hudson and Clive Burr to Neil Peart (RIP) to Mitch Mitchell and Bill Ward. From John Bonham to Phil Taylor and Nicko McBrain. All the while he was creating his own thing, odd times and polyrhythms played nonchalantly, powerful, simple, deliberate sections, all of the possibilities were in fact possible but utilized thoughtfully, in the proper place, for the proper effect, as the song demanded. Musically speaking, what more could you ask for?" ”

— Corrosion of Conformity, Official Statement [76]

The band's drum tech John Green, who had filled in for several shows in 2016 and from 2019 onward,[77] would be announced as the new drummer.
