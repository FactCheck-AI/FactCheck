It’s wartime, and young people are rushing into hasty –sometimes unwise – marriages. But not pretty, level-headed Alice. Then she meets Joe, a G.I. on a two-day pass, and falls heart-over-level-head in love. Judy Garland and Robert Walker are sweethearts for the ages in this glowing valentine of a movie directed by Vincente Minnelli (who, to add another layer of radiant romance, was about to marry his leading lady). And New York itself plays a role, transforming the whirlwind courtship into a love triangle. The city helps and hinders, holding the young lovers in a warm embrace one moment, then tossing up funny, frustrating roadblocks the next. The National Board of Review named The Clock one of the Top 10 movies of 1945. Film fans rate it even higher. They know The Clock is timeless, one of the great cinema loves of a lifetime.
