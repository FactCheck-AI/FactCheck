On this episode, our accidental '90s month comes to a close as we tackle the hysterical VR thriller, The Lawnmower Man! Which cut of the film did we all watch? What's with Jeff Fahey's coke-head laugh? And what bargain bin did Geoffrey Lewis get this Irish accent in? PLUS: How much of this southern judge's time can Stephen King take up?

The Lawnmower Man stars Jeff Fahey, Pierce Brosnan, Geoffrey Lewis, Jenny Wright, Mark Bringelson, Colleen Coffey, Jeremy Slate, and Dean Norris; directed by Brett Leonard.
