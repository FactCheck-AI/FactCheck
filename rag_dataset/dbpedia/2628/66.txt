Sporting Kansas City parted ways with Claudio Bieler on Tuesday, the MLS club announced, with the forward reportedly set to return to his native Argentina.

Bieler spent two seasons with Sporting KC after signing as a Designated Player before the 2013 season. He helped his new club to the MLS Cup in his first year with 10 goals, but the 30-year-old scored just twice in 13 league games last season.

While Bieler missed time with an injury, Dom Dwyer took over as first-choice striker and finished second in the league with 22 goals, making Bieler expendable.

"Claudio's service here was a huge help, especially during our run to MLS Cup in 2013," Sporting KC manager Peter Vermes said in a statement. "He was a professional since the moment he arrived and we are appreciative of his time in Kansas City. We wish him all the best."

The move frees up a DP slot for Sporting KC, who already has U.S. internationals Matt Besler and Graham Zusi on the books for next season.
