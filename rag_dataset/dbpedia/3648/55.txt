Merrick contracted influenza early this week and kept to his bed. He 1s up again and his condition has improved considerably, but Manager Bob Brocklebank deems it inadvisable to play him in tomorrow's Second Division match. There is no doubt he will be completely fit in a few days and therefore available for selection for the England team to meet Scotland at Hampden Park tomorrow week. At. Bury, John Schofield will deputise for Merrick in an otherwise unchanged team .

It will be Schofield's third League appearance this season. Left-winger Govan misses his third successive game because of a sprained ankle. Such is his progress, however, that there is little doubt he will be ft for next week's match. Mullen Returns The Wolves will have their regular wing in action again when they receive Middlesbrough in a First Division match at Molineux, for Jimmy Mullen has recovered from the thigh injury which kept him out of the last two games, and Dennis Wilshaw is available at inside-left. Norman Deeley keeps his place at left-half for the third successive game .

Doubts about the centre-half berth cause Middlesbrough to delay selection until tomorrow. Robinson has been named for the position, but if he falls a fitness test Dicks will deputise. A Walsall Change Don Colombo, Walsall's left-winger, 1s a victim of influenza. His place in the Walsall side to visit Bournemouth will be filled by John Scarlett whose previous appearances in the League side have been at inside-forward. He will wear contact lenses with which he was fitted only a few weeks ago, A previous Walsall player, fullback Bill Skidmore also wore contact lenses when playing .

The Other Semi-final Sheffield Wednesday will be at full strength for their F.A. Cup semi-final against Preston North End at Maine Road, Manchester. The Army have have released the right-wing pair, Alan Finney and Albert Quixall, and although right back Kenny has recovered from injury, Curtis, the former captain, retains his place. Preston will also have their fullside out at Maine Road. The players, several of whom were doubtful earlier In the week, underwent final tests today when the side completed their training, and all were pronounced fit .

H. Spiers, secretary of the Birmingham Combination, said the new league's name would be decided upon at a meeting to be held in the near future, but there was no doubt whatever that the words "Birmingham Combination" would form part of the title.

Will Albion Three Experts Give Their Views CITIZEN," experienced commentator, picks Albion, points to the contrasting Albion-Port Vale styles and advises caution. The Albion, premier team of the country, should win, but the operative word is So much can happen in 8 match to upset calculations particularly a Cup-tie. On their best form, the Albion's success would be assured, but not by 8 margin of more than two goals. Port Vale, too, are at their best, then 8 grand exhibition of football, contrasting two totally different styles 01 play, may well puts the Black Country side into the Final by an only goal. If .

both teams, maybe overawed little by the greatness of the occasion, are not. quite up to the standard 01 which they are capable, I consider the result will favour the Albion by two or three goals to one. Depends on Halves It will largely be a case the Albion attack versus Port Vale defence. Knowing the swiftness with which Albion's attacks are so often executed an attractive alliance of speed with accuracy and oppor tunism- must predict success for the First Division leaders. And look to Albion's wing halves as the chief architects in building up that triumph .

Port Vale's methods may SO unorthodox as to throw the Albion out of gear. If that should be the case, much will depend on the defence of the West Bromwich team. That defence will need to be on the alert every second of the 90 minutes. for I gather the Vale forwards have a knack of scoring from the odd breakaway, TASK TOO BIG FOR PORT VALE TOM BLUNT. the "Sports Final" columnist, goes all out for a clear-cut Albion win .

West Bromwich Albion 3, Port Vale 0. That: or something approximating to it, is how I expect to see the score-sheet read at the end of 90 minutes at Villa Park tomorrow. I know that this fighting Port Vale side have beaten both the Cupholders. Blackpool, and Cardiff City, among others on the way to the semifinal and I hand it to them for BEFORE AND AFTER This is what the experts think BEFORE the game. For the fullest and best account of what actually happens see tomorrow's eight-page Sports Final." Read Charles Richards' move bymove report .

Tom Blunt's summing-up. Danny Blanchflower's As a player saw it." Citizen will be at Maine Road covering the other semi-final. striking a blow for the smaller clubs, but this time I think they will run up something which they will not be able to handle. Just as team spirit has been largely instrumental in getting the Vale thus far in League and Cup, team spirit has played a big part in the Albion's fine League effort against clubs who can by no stretch of the imagination be compared with those who go to make up the Third Division North. A Danger Point As I see It, there is only one big danger for the Albion a touch of over confidence In defence which could lead to Mr .

Freddie Steele's men snatching the Arst goal. If this happens, West Bromwich supporters will have cause for anxiety, for the Vale would almost certainly resort to the strategy which has won them many a game this season, including their last tie against Leyton Orient. They would hang on to their lead like: grim death by packing, their defence and hoping for the best. And. of course, the game would steadily deteriorate as a spectacle .

am trusting the Albion not to let this happen and 11 they can produce their true form I think they will not only get that vital Arst goal but more besides, to ensure a place in the Final. ATTACK WILL PREVAIL DANNY BLANCHFLOWER. Aston Villa and Ireland. student of football strategy and Sports contributor, believes in quality, admires Port Vale, but picks Albion. I have been asked to make some predictions about tomorrow's match .

Rather I would set you thinking about the likely course of the game by posing some of the possibilities of what could be either the Match of the Season or the Flop of the Midlands." Only Fulham have scored more goals than the Albion, so the initials W.B.A. obviously suggest We Believe In Attack. On the other hand, that fantastic goals against record of the Vale's suggests that all out attack against them might be Perilous Will Cheadle stay put in the middle and Vale's defence refuse to be drawn by Allen's roving? then Nicholls' scope for bursting through may be limited. If the Vale's forwards fall back, as they apparently do. will not that also limit Allen's room for movement? On the other hand, such a defensive attitude could increase the scope for, attack .

In other words, it does not turn back the tide; it only delays it. Can Port Vale snatch a goal, then. and delay the tide for the rest of the game? Can they lull the Albion into a false sense of security and then, with sharp, Incisive attacks. steal the match? They have already proved this to be the most suitable method for their capabilities. It is worth bearing in mind that most the rivals have been of the attacking school .

Wonderful Albion don't believe the Albion have been guilty of any complacency recently, but 11 there was any such tendency. that 5-0 defeat by Chelsea should, have shaken them out of it. No, I think theirs has been a wonder ful performance this season. They have had good method and they have not been afraid to put that method first all the time. They have shown that if you keep on playing good football .

the rewards will come. Still. 1 I were a Vale player, think I would feel 8 psychological advantage over the Albion players, for the Albion are the favourites. Therefore, the men from the Potteries have nothing to lose. They can be glorious In valiant In defeat, and sympathised with if the match turns out to be completely one sided .

My own prophecy? It is this. I believe In quality; I believe there is a difference between the standards of the Divisions; I believe in constructiveness and ATTACK. What else can do but choose Albion? its first international crossBromford Bridge Racecourse twice since the event was Midlands been honoured with 1909 and Leamington in 1930. the race England, winners in Paris last France, Belgium, Spain Scotland.

The Scottish party was the Arst to arrive in the city last evening, just in time for tea at their headquarters at the Imperial Hotel. The French and Spanish teams also touched down at Elmdon last night. Some members of the English team also arrived and. with the remaining teams, took part In a trial run over the course this morning. Hopes were entertained that England would repeat her win in Paris last year, although it WAS realised that France would be strengthened by the inclusion of Alain Mimoun, twice the individual winner of the event, and that Belgium had capable newcomers in her ranks Spain, too .

EVERY GARMENT CARRIES THE WELL NOWN GUARANTEE SATISFACTION OR UTTOXETER RACES Monday, April 5th, 1954 FIRST RACE 2 p.m. PEACE MOVE BY FILM MEN Ready to Lift Restrictions Mr. George Elvin, general secretary of the Association of Cine Technicians, will report to the Minister of Labour (Sir Walter Monckton) today that his members are willing to lift their work-to-rule and overtime ban in Alm laboratoriesThe decision, reached after a fourhour meeting of the Association's Executive last night, is not unconditional, but it may avert the threatened crisis in the film industry. Peace moves in the dispute, which threatened to spread throughout the industry and involve 6.000 workers, began on Tuesday when Sir Walter decided to appoint a Committee of Investigation. He asked employers and the union to take immediate steps to enable normal working to be resumed in the laboratories .

The technicians' executive passed 8 resolution that they were willing to await the committee of investigation and, without prejudice, to lift their work-to-rule and overtime ban to allow the committee to conduct Its work in a reasonable atmosphere. The Minister, they suggested, should extract similar undertakings from the employers' associations, other than the Film Laboratory Association, with regard to no hostile action and withdrawal of notices at once. The resolution said that a mass I meeting of the membership would be held on Sunday, and in the light of replies to these requests for assurances, we shall recommend the date to be agreed with the employers for a recommencement of work. Further Talks on Railmen's Pay A further meeting was being held in London today of the British Transport Commission and the engineering and railway unions on the claim for a 15 per cent. increase pay for about 116,000 employees in the railway workshops, Earlier this month the Transport Commission offered an increase of 7s .

a week for men and proportionate increases for women and juniors. The unions rejected it. In the railway wages settlement earlier this year, 7s. was the lowest increase for men and the maximum was 10s. The engineering unions feel that their skilled men particularly should receive more than the 7s .

EPIC HOUSE, HAGLEY ROAD, B'HAM, 16 Telegrams: "Epic, B'ham Telephone: EDGbaston 3636 (all. lines) A Portuguese gunman shot dead two days ago after murdering a London jeweller, Mr. Marcus Wehrle (aged 56), outside Wehrle's shop in Marylebone, was released only a few months ago after imprisonment in the United States on a murder charge, his half-brother has revealed in Lisbon .

The half-brother, Alfredo Sa, said that Justine de Almeida (aged, 49), was later cleared of the murder charge, given indemnification and sent home to Portugal, according to a story a Lisbon prison warder told the family. Alfredo Sa said they believed Almeida dead until he returned to Lisbon on Christmas Eve. Almeida had been in the United States since he was seven and came to Lisbon to see his mother, but she died five years ago. He was arrested at Lisbon Airport on arrival because he had no documents. Alfredo Sa added that he managed to secure Almeida's release four days later, Went On Business He continued: When my wife went to the prison to see Almeida, the guard told her that my brother had served 16 years' imprisonment in the United States on a murder charge, but he was released and given indemnification .
