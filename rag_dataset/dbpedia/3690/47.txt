Some would say Moolah Beach is like Survivor but it really isn't. This show is a pleasure to watch because it is different. It kind of reminds me of those good Nickelodeon game shows that are now gone. With most of television so boring Moolah is a huge plus. It airs on Fox Family Channel which is home to Mall Star Countdown which also gets high marks in my opinion. If you haven't been watching the show start watching it or record it. In fact I'll let you find out how good it is. I won't be describing the show here. Like "The Amazing Race" on CBS which is struggling in the ratings probably because it airs after the frozen 60 Minutes 2. Moolah Beach gets high marks!
