Dear Forum,

Mike Nesmith's 12 string was supposedly a custom job. Does this look like a 17" or 16" body?

Thanks for your help.

Here's what says my book "The Guitars of the Fred Gretsch Company" by Jay Scott (1992) about the model 6076 12-strings, and notably Mike Nesmith's one :

As you can read at the end, it's reputedly a 17" wide...

A+!

Yes, I am looking to buy a 12 string, and found a 16" , but I would rather have a 17" one

I don't think i've ever seen an original vintage natural 17" wide Gretsch 12 string 6076,other than Mikes .

The Custom Shop did one a few years ago ,but it was rather expensive!

Now that's a reply worthy of a two thumbs up,

Just goes to show ya, seek and ye shall find!

I wonder if Mike could have told him. ...or if he knew?

Best,

I was just practicing with my Electromatic 12-string yesterday, and man it just amazes me every time I pick it up. I was playing through a Tech 21 SansAmp Blonde right into my mixer/PA-just the small monitors, with a little bit of stereo chorus into the board. Just magical. I seem to be on a Who kick lately, Bargain, Substitute, the Kids are Alright, just some fun jamming. I also throw in some John Denver and Glenn Campbell too. Now, you all have piqued my interest in some Monkey's material, I need to do some homework.

@gretschguy , Seems you're looking for a blonde one ? I don't think there in production anymore as I cannot find one on Musicians Friend or Guitar Center . Electromatic versions of blondes were a FSR and appears to have ended in 2018 There's one listed on Reverb.com and I suggest grabbing it

I love mine and I'm sure my buddy @GlenP will chime in too . Here's my 2018 FSR G5422-12 . Best of luck with your search

Might be kind of corny, but a 12-string really needs two birds for a nickname.

I call mine "The Eagle & The Hawk" inspired by the John Denver song.

As long as I can still sing it, I will keep playing it.

(Fun with clip art and waterslide decals.)

In my wildest guitar dream, I want a 12 string, double-cut, center-block, Falcon w/ Bigs. That thing sounds incredible. Enough to make a grown man get something in his eye.

Their 3rd and 4th albums Monkees Headquarters & Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. They played most of the instruments on the 3rd album and many on the 4th.
