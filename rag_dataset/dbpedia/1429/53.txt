Philipp Max has played every game this season for FCA and, this Sunday, he hopes to continue that run against VfB Stuttgart. On the opposition side will be Max’s former teammate and good friend Erik Thommy. Erik Thommy’s move to Stuttgart hasn’t put an end to their friendship. “We’re still good friends and speak on the phone a lot,” clarified Philipp Max. During the winter break, Thommy decided he sought a new challenge and moved to Stuttgart. “I’m happy for him that he’s made the next step,” said Max. “As a club, sure it’s a shame.” On Sunday, the former teammates meet on the pitch. The FCA left-back wants to see him bounce back after the 2-0 loss in Leipzig. “We know we’re far better than that,” stated Max. “We’ll show that on Sunday. I’m sure of it.” VfB are currently in 14th place but their fight against the drop is far from over. The 24-year-old is expecting “a high quality game.” With 31 points already to their name, FCA are well on track for survival. “We’ve made serious strides this season as a team. Every day contributes to that,” explained Philipp Max who reflected: “Our motivation at this part of the season last time around was very different. Everyone thought we’d get relegated.” With 11 assists so far, the man at the top of the Bundesliga assists charts is happy with how his game has improved. With three points, FCA can continue their strong home form of late. FCA’s number 31 emphasised: “We have to be better all over the pitch compared with last Friday.” The left-back may be looking forward to see his friend again but he reiterated the fact that: “When it comes to getting points, we’re no longer friends.” The two players have already agreed to swap shirts at the final whistle.
