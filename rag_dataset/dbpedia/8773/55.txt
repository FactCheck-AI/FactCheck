Bari, between historical monuments and traditions

Bari is the capital city of Apulia, as well as its biggest city. It is characterized by a peculiar historical center, called Bari Vecchia, whose buildings retrace the historical periods of the city. In Bari, there is also one of the best examples of Apulian Romanesque architecture, the Basilica of San Nicola, just like the Norman-Swabian Castle is an excellent example of Norman-Swabian one. The city also has a modern side, the Murat district, which stretches on the lakefront and hosts some of the most beautiful palaces of the first half of the XX century.
