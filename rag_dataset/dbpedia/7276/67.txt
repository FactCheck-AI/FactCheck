Avant Window Navgator (Awn) is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of the screen (in all its composited- goodness) tracking open windows.

Awn uses libwnck to keep a track of open windows, and behaves exactly like a normal window-list

* Clicking an icon switches to that window, clicking again will minimise the window

* Right-clicking will bring up a menu extactly like that of what you see on the window-list, allowing you to max, min, close, resize etc the window.

* Dragging something on top of an icon will activate that window.

* Visually (and quite attractively) responds to 'needs attention' & 'urgent' events

* Can show windows from the entire viewport, or just the visible viewport.
