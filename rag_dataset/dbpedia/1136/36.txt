In the heart of the Nassau Valley, the Appleton Estate distillery has distinguished itself as a pillar of the rum industry since its founding within a vast sugar estate. Its unique karst soil, dotted with caves and enriched with minerals, imbues every drop of rum with incomparable richness. Under the visionary leadership of Joy Spence, the world's first female Master Blender, Appleton Estate fuses tradition and innovation to create exceptional rums. The Appleton Signature Blend is the result of this passion and expertise, a harmonious blend of aged rums that celebrates Jamaican heritage and craftsmanship.

Discover Jamaican rums with this Appleton Signature Blend

The Appleton Signature Blend is a liquid work of art, resulting from a meticulous blend of fifteen rums of varying ages, the youngest having aged four years. Each component is carefully selected from naturally fermented molasses with local yeasts, enriched by the dunder, the fermented residue that enriches each new cuv√©e. The distillation combines pot stills and Creole columns, capturing the iconic essence of Appleton Estate. Aging in American white oak barrels in the tropical Jamaican climate gives this rum its unique character and golden color, without the addition of artificial colors or fragrances.
