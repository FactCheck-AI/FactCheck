Horam station was on the Cuckoo Line between Hellingly and Heathfield, serving the village of Horam.

The station was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1880. It was on the line extension from Hailsham to Eridge.

The station closed to passenger traffic in 1965 but freight trains continued to pass through until 1968 when the line was closed completely.

The Cuckoo Line is a now disused railway line which linked Polegate and Eridge in East Sussex, from 1880 to 1968. The railway line served the following Sussex communities: Polegate, Hailsham, Hellingly, Horam for Waldron, Heathfield, Mayfield, Rotherfield and Eridge. Services continued through Eridge and onward via Groombridge to Tunbridge Wells.

The Hailsham-Eridge section closed in 1965, the Polegate-Hailsham branch surviving until 1968. Eridge-Tunbridge Wells closed in 1985, and this line has been resurrected as the Spa Valley Railway.

The section of the line from Polegate to Heathfield is now National Cycle Network Route 21 and The Cuckoo Trail.
