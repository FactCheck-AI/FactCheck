You may not recognize the name, but you recognize the face. Actor Charles Durning once served in the United States Army and stormed the beaches of Normandy on this fateful June day. And to be honest, Mr. Durning is quite the badass if you ask us. Having survived through...untold luck or skill, perhaps a little bit of both, Durning came out of World War 2 with a Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts.We always get a little bit giddy when we meet a veteran from World War 2. Don't let the age of their bodies fool you. Those men slew evil in bulk and did it without night vision goggles, SAPI plates, and high dollar optics. They were just brilliant in the basics of fighting and winning. Men like Charles Durning got shit done.As the D-Day landings progressed, Charles and his unit (we're assuming squad or platoon) were ambushed by a German machine gun nest. It killed everyone except Durning. Later on in the war, as the Allies made their merry way through Belgium, Durning was stabbed by a German soldier, he then killed that enemy soldier with a rock.Yes. HE BEAT ANOTHER MAN TO DEATH WITH A ROCK!

Durning was captured by the Germans during the Battle of the Bulge...but he escaped instead of being massacred by Germans.Charles Durning passed away on December 24th, 2012. The man who had assaulted the beaches of Normandy and fought in close quarters and starred in movies lived one hell of a life and serves as a great example to veterans for the rich lives we can lead after leaving the service.Time spares no man, these men who did such incredible and brave acts should be valued and treasured while we have them and long after they have passed for the tremendous example of honor, dignity and bravery they have displayed.Read more stories of American Grit:
