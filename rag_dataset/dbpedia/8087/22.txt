Luddington is one of the eight original parishes in the Isle of Axholme in the far northwest corner of Lincolnshire. Crowle parish lies 5 miles to the south-west and Scunthorpe is 10 miles south-east. The parish covers about 3,700 acres and inlcudes the township of Garthorpe.

Luddington was once a river island, having the Meredyke on the south, the Trent on the east and the Don on the north and west. At the time it was the most northern parish in the Isle of Axholme. If you are planning a visit:
