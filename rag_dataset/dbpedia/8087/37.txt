Head Teacher's Welcome

Welcome to the website for The Riverside Federation.

We are two small rural primary schools (Eastoft Church of England Primary and Luddington and Garthorpe Primary), based on the Isle of Axholme in North Lincolnshire.

Our schools aim to provide a broad and balanced curriculum, equipping pupils with the key skills required to prepare them for the next stage in life.

Please click on the tabs at the top of the page for further information about each school. We look forward to hearing from you.

If you require any paper copies of information published on the website, please contact Mrs Oxley (loxley@riversidefederation.co.uk) to request. Thank you

Mrs J Bassindale

Executive Head Teacher
