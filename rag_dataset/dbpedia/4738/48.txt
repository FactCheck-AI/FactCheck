Mota-Engil SGPS SA, Portugal’s biggest builder, canceled plans for an initial public offering next week in London for its African unit after concerns about Grupo Espirito Santo’s finances roiled global markets.

“Events and the performance of equity markets in the last 48 hours meant that the scale of orders was negatively impacted,” Mota-Engil Africa said in a regulatory filing today. Mota-Engil Africa, which was scheduled to begin trading on the London Stock Exchange on July 16, remains “fully committed” to carrying out an IPO in the future, it said.
