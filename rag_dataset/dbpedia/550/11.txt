ABOUT CALLA LILY:

Zantedeschia elliottiana or commonly called Calla lilies produce flowers of vibrant colours and are mainly valued as ornamental plants. However, these lilies are not considered true lilies belonging to the Liliaceae family. They can be found on almost all continents except for Antarctica.

The physical stature of the plants is featured with long, spongy petioles of various lengths, varied shapes of the leaf lamina, and thick modified underground stem (rhizome or tuber) contractile roots emerging out of the tubers.

The members under the Zantedeschia genus exhibit a wide range of plant heights from 50-60 cm to up to 1.5-2 meters.

HOW TO GROW CALLA LILY PLANT: The Calla lilies are naturally found to grow in marshy lands. They can switch to deciduous plants in cases of water scarcity. Bulbs can be sown at a depth of 2 inches with the eyes facing upwards in a pot or directly in a soil bed outdoors. A gap of 3-4 inches can be maintained between two consecutive bulbs.

WEATHER CONDITIONS: The plant demands a consistent supply of water, and direct sunlight during the winters. In places of hot climates, a shady area is preferred for growing these plants.

AVAILABLE IN: Pack of 5 Bulbs. With 5 Different color
