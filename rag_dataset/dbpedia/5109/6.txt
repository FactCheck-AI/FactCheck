contentDetails.hasCustomThumbnail boolean

Indicates whether the video uploader has provided a custom thumbnail image for the video. This property is only visible to the video uploader. status object

The status object contains information about the video's uploading, processing, and privacy statuses. status.uploadStatus string

The status of the uploaded video.

Valid values for this property are:

status.privacyStatus string

The video's privacy status.

Valid values for this property are:

private

public

unlisted

status.publishAt datetime

The date and time when the video is scheduled to publish. It can be set only if the privacy status of the video is private. The value is specified in ISO 8601 format. Note the following two additional points about this property's behavior:

If you set this property's value when calling the videos.update method, you must also set the status.privacyStatus property value to private even if the video is already private.

If your request schedules a video to be published at some time in the past, the video will be published right away. As such, the effect of setting the status.publishAt property to a past date and time is the same as of changing the video's privacyStatus from private to public.

creativeCommon

youtube

status.embeddable boolean

This value indicates whether the video can be embedded on another website. status.publicStatsViewable boolean

This value indicates whether the video is designated as child-directed, and it contains the current "made for kids" status of the video. For example, the status might be determined based on the value of the selfDeclaredMadeForKids property. See the YouTube Help Center for more information about setting the audience for your channel, videos, or broadcasts. status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids boolean

In a videos.insert or videos.update request, this property allows the channel owner to designate the video as being child-directed. In a videos.list request, the property value is only returned if the channel owner authorized the API request. statistics object
