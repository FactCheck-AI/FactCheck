The answer is Abu Dhabi!

Abu Dhabi is the capital of UAE, and the largest amongst all the cities of this country as well. It is also the second-most populous city after Dubai in the UAE.

Let’s find out more about the capital of UAE!

Background

The name Abu Dhabi denotes a very interesting meaning. It means “father of the gazelle”.

This name dates from 1762, when members of the Al Bu Falah family were hunting and going after a gazelle. It walked through the shallow waters of the Gulf to the island, and thirty-one years later, they made the island their permanent home.

Thus, the name Abu Dhabi was born.

After the departure of the British from the Persian Gulf in December 1971, the UAE was liberated. Formerly, Abu Dhabi was an undeveloped town that only had local importance. Abu Dhabi could only develop into a modern city because of the emirate’s oil revenues being the turning point of its luck.

However, Abu Dhabi was not officially recognized as the capital of the UAE until the early 1990s.
