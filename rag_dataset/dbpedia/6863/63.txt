We offer premium quality British education that is accessible to girls and boys from the ages of 3 to 18. We strive to challenge and inspire all learners to develop their skills and nurture values through a love of learning. We want our students to embrace the challenges of tomorrow responsibly.

We place great emphasis on our values and community spirit, which support us in our mission ‘Everyone Counts, Everyone Contributes, Everyone Succeeds’.

Located at Umm Al Sheif in the heart of Jumeirah, our facilities enable us to give every child the opportunity to thrive. We are very proud of the balance we provide between academic, rigour, creative, and sporting pursuits.
