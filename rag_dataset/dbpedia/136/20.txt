Superb hike on the Schrattenfluh, a mountain located near Sörenberg. The route makes a nice loop passing by several summits: the Wagliseichnubel, the Hengst, the Türstehäuptli, the Schibengütsch as well as the Böli. In short, a real little corner of paradise that offers superb views of the surroundings.
