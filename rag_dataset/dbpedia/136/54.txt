Heading up the hill from Sörenberg, a popular winter ski area The wind is blowing chilly on this upper moor landscape Clouds sit low on the Brienzergrat (Brienz Ridge) which separates us from Interlaken to the South Ahead of us are the flanks of the ridge called the Schrattenfluh Walking on this section of Trail No.2, "Trans Swiss Trail" from Sörenberg to Kemmeriboden Bad. At the back, a prominent peak on the Schrattenfluh range (Böli) We discovered this gem, a beautiful farmhouse with a "Self Serve" shop Along the way, a "Hofladen" (Farmstead Shop), a renovated cellar room in the family home. We often come across these "Self-Serve" farm product offerings, but this shop was particularly special. Heading West along the Schrattenfluh range on the right, and the Hohgant range ahead To the South a view of the Brienzer Ridge. Crossing the Emme River at Kemmeriboden Bad, with the Hohgant Range to the South. The historical buildings at Kemmeriboden Bad, a popular tourist destination especially on a Sunday afternoon! The specialty here is Meringues with icecream and whipped cream. People come from far and wide for this dessert.
