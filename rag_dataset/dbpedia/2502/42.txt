Hello, my name is Nina M. Fetter. I am the owner of Sirius Kennels, Inc. I have been involved professionally in the sport of purebred dogs for over 25 years.

Both of my parents are judges for the American Kennel Club and have traveled all over the world judging dog shows. I suppose you could say I was destined to be in the sport of pure bred dogs.

Over the many years I have been handling professionally, I have been fortunate to have had the opportunity to show many top-winning dogs.

My credentials include:

Professional Handlers Association Inc. (PHA); board member and officer Dog Handlers Guild, Inc. (DHG); board member Registered Handler by the American Kennel Club. (AKC) Member of the American Pomeranian Club Member of the Basenji Club of America Member of the Border Terrier Club of America Member of the Lima Kennel Club.

Occasionally I breed Pomeranians and Border Terriers. I am very devoted to my breeding program and very selective about how I breed. All of my puppies have a clean bill of health and are bred to the standard for their individual breed.
