His parents Lawrence and Amphillis Twigden enjoyed the comforts of life near the rural village of Sulgrave. His father Lawrence was both a scholar and a cleric. The Washington ancestral home of Sulgrave Manor, situated near Banbury and about 30 miles from both Stratford-upon-Avon and Oxford, was a palatial home. The family's comfortable life was established by John's grandfather Lawrence Washington in 1539 based on his wealth as a wool merchant and his position as Mayor of Northampton during the reign of King Henry VIII. The Washingtons were Royalists and property owners, which placed them in the upper classes of English society. At the age of 8 years in 1640, young John Washington was enrolled in a prestigious education program at Sutton's Hospital in London based on a nomination by King Charles I of England. His future looked very promising. John Washington (1633-1677) was about 19 years of age when his father died, and two years later when his mother died he went to London, probably taking his brother Lawrence with him. The brothers saw the new opportunities in trade with the American colonies, and John, already married, sailed for Virginia in 1656 as mate and voyage partner of Edward Prescott, owner of the Sea Horse of London. His first wife died, and he re-married the daughter of an American planter, Lieutenant-<strong>Col</strong>onel Nathaniel Pope. Their wedding present was a 700 acre estate at Mattox Creek where their eldest son, Lawrence, was born in 1659 and the American line of the Washington Family was established. When John came of age, soon afterwards, he went to London. He married and sailed for Virginia in 1656, unfortunately his wife died and in 1658 he married again, this time to Anne, daughter of Lieutenant-<strong>Col</strong>onel Nathaniel Pope JP, of The Cliffs, an early settlement on the northern neck of Virginia near the Potomac. The wedding present from his father-inlaw was a 700 acre estate at Mattox Creek, where their eldest son Lawrence was born in 1659. Although, during their family history, the Washingtons moved to different places in England, their roots lie in the north, in the "Original" Washington in England and in Warton in Lancashire. <strong>George</strong> Washington, First President of the United States' grandmother lies peacefully at rest in Whitehaven, Cumbria.
