Jerry was a former member of the Archibald Water Board, Oder of the Eastern Star Mangham Chapter #152, and committee member for the Archibald Beautification Program, also he was a member of DMA Senior Citizen’s Group. He is a member of the W. M. Baker Masonic Lodge #388 in Mangham, LA.

Jerry had a great love and concern for people, and one of the ways he expressed this concern was by visiting the nursing homes and hospitals and also he visited the sick and shut-in’s at their homes. He always received as big a blessing from visiting the people as they received from his visit.

For fifty years Jerry was a brick layer, and taught others the trade. He always took great pride in his work because he wanted it to look good. After retiring from laying bricks he became a custodian for the Mangham Elementary School. He enjoyed this job very much, because he got to visit with people. He was recognized for his good job by being chosen Outstanding School Support Employee for a year, and was recognized by the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) in Baton Rouge, LA.

Most recently Jerry was honored by Cedar Baptist Church for his good and faithful service to the church and community. Jerry will be greatly missed by all that knew and loved him.
