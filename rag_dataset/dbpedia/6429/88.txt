Regulated/Restricted Commodities

A broad range of commodities require import clearance/licenses from appropriate government agencies prior to importation into the Philippines. Discretionary licensing arrangements are in place for rice imports. The National Food Authority (NFA) is the sole importer of rice and continues to be involved in the importation of corn. Private grain dealers with import clearance are allowed to import rice.

Furniture manufacturers and agents, as well as log and lumber contractors and lumber dealers, may import wood materials under several different licensing regimes. Importers must submit a Phytosanitary Certificate issued by the country of origin to the Department of Agriculture’s Bureau of Plant Industry (DA-BPI). The Department of Agriculture also issues biosafety permits for the use of genetically modified (GM) plant and plant products for field trials, commercial propagation, and/or direct use as food, feed, or processing.
