From the creators of 2018’s Searching comes a stand-alone sequel about 18-year-old June, who uses her amateur detective skills in an effort to locate her mom and her mom’s boyfriend. But as the story becomes national news, June ends up finding out secrets that her mother meant to stay hidden. Like its predecessor, Missing uses technology — video chats, text convos, search engines, voice mails, social media — as a narrative tool. The tense thriller was directed and written by Will Merrick and Nick Johnson, with story by Searching co-writers Sev Ohanian and Aneesh Chaganty.

When will Missing be released?

It’s streaming now.

Is Missing based on a true story?

No. The actions depicted in this movie are fictional.

Is Missing a sequel to Searching?

Yes, sort of. Searching, starring John Cho, and Missing are both mystery thrillers told through technology — but the stories are both stand-alone. Missing’s story is from the minds of Searching co-creators Ohanian and Chaganty.

What happens in Missing?

June’s mom, Grace, is heading to Colombia on vacation with her boyfriend, Kevin — which is great for June, who’s planning a huge party while they’re gone. But days later, when June’s supposed to pick up her mom and Kevin from the airport, they don’t show up. No texts, no calls, nothing. So June, using her internet-sleuthing prowess and knowledge from true-crime show binges, sets out to find them. As she stumbles upon information about their whereabouts, however, she learns Kevin may not be the person he says he is. And her mom might not be, either.

Where does Missing take place?

The film takes place in Los Angeles.
