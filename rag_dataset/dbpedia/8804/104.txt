Burning money. Woman burning German currency (German Papiermark) during the hyperinflation in Germany in the early 1920s. Before World War I, the Germany currency was known as the Goldmark. In the early 1920s, due to the effects of the war and the printing of notes by the post-war German government (the Weimar Republic), the currency became known as the German Papiermark. The hyperinflation meant that by 1923 the price of ordinary goods and food was billions of marks. The marks were literally not worth the paper they were printed on, and it was cheaper to burn them than buy fuel.
