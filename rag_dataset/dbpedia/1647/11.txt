British filmmaker Marc Evans (Hinterland) will direct Safe House, a character-driven drama created and written by Michael Crompton (Carrie’s War), to air on U.K. commercial broadcaster ITV.

Eleventh Hour Films (EHF), the independent production banner established by Jill Green, who produced George Clooney-starrer The American, directed by Anton Corbijn, will make the show.

Billed as an atmospheric thriller set in the wilderness of the Lake District, the show details the story of a married couple who turn their remote guest house into a safe house.

Inspired by a true story and designed as a major new returnable event drama, Safe House aims to provide a fresh angle on the investigative genre.

Safe House was greenlit by ITV director of drama Steve November and controller of drama Victoria Fea and marks the first commission under the direction of EHF’s newly expanded creative team after being developed by the banner’s head of development, Paula Cuddy (Wallander).

Alongside Green and Cuddy are executive producer Eve Gutierrez (Evans’ Collision) and commercial director Nicole Finnan (Case Histories).

Green described Safe House as “a quality drama with intelligently crafted characters delivering a complex and engaging story that will keep the viewer gripped.”

Evans works across movies and television and his movie Patagonia, shot in Welsh and English, was the British pick in this year’s foreign-language Oscar nomination chase in 2011.

His other credits include hit TV show Collision, which stars Douglas Henshall.

Eleventh Hour Films is also currently in production on a ninth series of ratings-winning drama Foyle’s War for ITV.
