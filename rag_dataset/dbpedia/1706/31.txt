Toronto restaurant Manita slammed Star Trek actor Zachary Quinto on Monday, writing on Instagram that the actor yelled at staff “like an entitled child.”

“Zachary Quinto — an amazing Spock, but a terrible customer,” the restaurant wrote on Instagram. “Yelled at our staff like an entitled child after he didn’t reply to two texts to inform him his table was ready and refused to believe the empty tables in the dining room weren’t available for him despite being politely informed they were spoken for. Made our host cry and the rest of our brunch diners uncomfortable.”

Quinto played Spock in the 2009 Star Trek movie, and reprised the role for sequels Star Trek Into Darkness (2013) and Star Trek Beyond (2016)

“Mr. Quinto, take your bad vibes somewhere else, we have many lovely celebrities join us at Manita but you are NOT one of them,” the message continued.

The post was a screenshot of an Instagram story that the restaurant said they posted on Sunday. In the caption on Monday, they expanded: “This isn’t the first time, nor will it be the last time an irate guest has taken their frustrations out on our staff. Manita is deeply grateful for our mostly incredible, friendly, gracious guests… who may give us constructive feedback from time to time.”

The post concluded: “To all the other Zachary Quintos out there, on behalf of restaurant workers everywhere: We aren’t above criticism, but we are above being demeaned.”

Representatives for Quinto did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
