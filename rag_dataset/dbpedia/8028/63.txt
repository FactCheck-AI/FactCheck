A teenager has begun a campaign for a memorial to be built in honour of the Somerset-born science fiction writer Sir Arthur C Clarke.

Sir Arthur co-wrote the screenplay 2001: A Space Odyssey. He was born in Minehead on 16 December 1917 and died in Sri Lanka in 2008.

John Knight, 16, said: "We're intending to get a nine-foot high black granite monolith."

He said he wanted the monolith placed in Blenheim Gardens in the town.

West Somerset Council said if John can prove there is public interest, his idea can be explored further.

The teenager is a fan of science fiction, having collected most of Sir Arthur's works.
