Contao version 3.5.33 is available. The bugfix release restores the PHP 5.4 compatibility and fixes problems with MariaDB 10.2.4+ and MySQL 8.

PHP 5.4

Even if Contao 3.5 still supports PHP 5.4, we strongly advise against using outdated PHP versions. Contao 3.5 is compatible with the latest PHP versions, therefore – if the installed extensions allow it – you should run it with PHP 7 or at least PHP 5.6.

Identifier Quoting

We have revised identifier quoting, which we had added to Contao 4.4.10, and ported it to Contao 3, so Contao 3.5 should be compatible with MariaDB 10.2.4+ and MySQL 8 now.
