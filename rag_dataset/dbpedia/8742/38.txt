Local installations

You can also install Contao locally. This requires a web server, a database and PHP. For the different operating systems ready-made solutions, such as XAMPP or Laragon, exists.

Another alternative is using Docker. If the current Docker releases are not available for your operating system, you can also use the Docker Toolbox.

The following descriptions only reflect possible alternatives of a local installation and therefore should only be treated as such.

When you are done with your local development, you can then transfer the installation to a live server.
