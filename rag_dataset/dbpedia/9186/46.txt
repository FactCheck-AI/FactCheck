Kyiv is the capital city of Ukraine, (also spelled «Kiyev» on Russian) its largest economical, political, educational and cultural centre. Kyiv is often called the mother of Slavic cities. It is more than fifteen centuries old and during this time Kyiv has come a long way from its beginning as an ancient settlement of nomadic tribes to being one of the largest cities in the world. Kyiv is integrally connected to Slavic cultural development. Its monuments, architectural ensembles and cathedrals charm with their beauty, harmony and historical meaningfulness. The sights and attractions of the Ukrainian capital are covered with the spirit of old glorious times.

It was severely damaged during World War II, but by the mid-1950s it had been restored, and in the second half of the 20th century it enjoyed a well-developed economic and cultural life. The independence of Ukraine from the Soviet Union in 1991 renewed Kyiv’s status as a major European capital.

There are plenty of parks and places of historical interest in Kyiv. The city limits enclose an area of 300 square miles (780 square km) on both banks of the Dnieper. It is divided into a number of administrative wards. The focus of Kyiv is the area of the ancient Upper Town, crowning the high bluffs of the Dnieper. Although largely of postwar construction, this central area retains its old street pattern, and most of the surviving historical and architectural monuments are located there.
