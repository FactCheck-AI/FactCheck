Lost Royal Tombs

Quite a lot of French Royal Tombs were destroyed & lost forever following the French Revolution,many of the churches too have been demolished .Whilst St Denis Abbey was reserved for Monarchs,consorts and their children/spouses many churches in Paris were used as burial sites for the cadet branches of the French Royal Family & contained many Princely & Royal Tombs.

List of lost churches

The Dominican Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Honoré

The Dominican Couvent des Jacobins de la rue Saint-Jacques

The Couvent des Célestins de Paris.

The now destroyed Collégiale Saint-Georges de Vendôme was the burial site for the Counts and later Dukes of Vendôme ,Jeanne d'Albret mother of Henry IV was also buried here in 1572.

The church ransacked and pillaged by Huguenots in 1562 and completely destroyed and torn down in 1794 during the French Revolution.

The ruins today.

The Saint-Laurent collegiate church at Joinville housed the tombs of the Princely and Ducal House of Guise and the medieval Lords of Joinville .During the height of the French Revolution he tombs and coffins were desecrated and the church torn down in 1793 and the Princely remains dumped in a nearby cemetery.

Fragments of the now destroyed tomb of Claude de Lorraine, duc de Guise are now housed at the Louvre

In September 1841,King Louis-Philippe had the Guise Princely remains reburied with those of the Lords of Joinville in a new tomb at the cemetery

What happened to Jeanne d'Albret's remains ? Considering that she was a leading Huguenot, it would be odd if the Huguenots desecrated her tomb.

The sack by the hugenots happened in ten years before Jeanne died. Her remains were safe until the tombs were destroyed by the French revolution. Some of the remains of the royal tombs were found in an excavation, but they were never identified.
