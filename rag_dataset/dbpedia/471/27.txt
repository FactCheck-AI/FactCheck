Peter Phillips’ work ranges from oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages. Vibrant in color and filled with borrowed iconography of images drawn from daily life, Peter’s work appeals to the spectator’s memory, elevates curiosity and awakens their minds to the world around them.

Peter Phillips is one of the preeminent British Pop Artists of our time. His work ranges from oils on canvas to multi-media compositions and collages. As one of the originators of Pop Art, Peter got his start at the Royal College of Arts with his fellow students David Hockney, Allen Jones, R.B. Kitaj and others of the British Pop Art Movement. When he was awarded a Harkness Fellowship he moved to New York, where he exhibited his work alongside his American counterparts Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and James Rosenquist. Peter’s work can be seen in dozens of museums and galleries worldwide. He now resides in Australia where he continues to paint and exhibit.
