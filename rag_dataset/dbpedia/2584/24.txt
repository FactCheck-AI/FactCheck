The Best Film award was one of three honors presented to Bol at the prestigious London Asian Film Festival. It also received awards for Best Female Actor (Humaima Malik) and Best New Talent (Amr Kashmiri).

By all accounts, Bol has been a groundbreaking film in Pakistan and across much of Asia and beyond. Not only has Bol earned more than any other film in Pakistan’s history, and shown the world the true power of entertainment education, but it has spurred conversation about gender equity, family planning and maternal health among top policy makers in Pakistan.

Indeed, in speaking to the media following receipt of her award for Best Actress, Humaima Malik underscored the importance of the film, saying, “[Bol] is a very meaningful film. […] It features the real experiences of women. It’s an important film because the subject is so powerful.”
