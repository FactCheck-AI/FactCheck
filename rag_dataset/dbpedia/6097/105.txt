Out of the trailers that I could've chosen to feature today, instead of the spoof on Michael Moore (you can watch that one here), I decided to feature this one - My Life in Ruins. I realize that this stars the same actress who wrote and starred in My Big Fat Greek Wedding, which pretty much makes this a movie that no one I know will want to see. However, we've seen enough violent trailers for one weekend, so I thought why not feature a more lighthearted adult comedy? The only scenes that made me laugh were the ones with Harland Williams, who I love as a stand-up comic, but haven't seen much on the big screen. Otherwise, Nia Vardalos looks like she'll do a good job as the lead, but that's about it. Care to watch?

Watch the international trailer for My Life in Ruins:

My Life in Ruins is directed by veteran filmmaker Donald Petrie, of Grumpy Old Men, Miss Congeniality, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, and Just My Luck previously. The script was written by screenwriter Mike Reiss, of "The Critic", "The Simpsons", and The Simpsons Movie as well. The film made its appearance at Cannes in the film market and was picked up by Fox Searchlight for distribution. They have not set a release date yet, but we can expect it to arrive sometime in early 2009. The poster is featured below.
