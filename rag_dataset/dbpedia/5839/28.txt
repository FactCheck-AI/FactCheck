Aeronica was the successful bidder when the Army at WSMR went out for bid to

supply the Pogo-Hi as a range service

Description: Pogo: In 1953, the Physical Science Laboratory of the New Mexico

State University developed the Pogo vehicle under a U.S. Navy contract to provide a

high-altitude radar target. The Pogo rocket consisted of a solid-propellant rocket

motor and a large nose cone. The rocket's four square tail fins were canted to

induce a stabilizing spin. At the peak of the trajectory (at more than 30 km (100000

ft)), the nose cone was separated and began to descend under a large (6 m (20 ft)

diameter) metallized parachute. This parachute made an excellent target for tests of

radars and radar-guided missiles.

Pogo-Hi: Upgraded versions of the Pogo target were generally referred to as

Pogo-Hi. They were flown in several different configurations, and used a variety of

motors like the Cajun, Apache and Asp. The major external difference between the

Pogo-Hi vehicles and the original Pogo configuration were the former's triangular tail

fins.

Photo: Photo is 8x10 and in excellent condition on fiber based paper.

Description: Typed press description on reverse reads, " Fired by an electronic

impulse 1500 miles away in Kingston, N.Y., an Air Force BOMARC is successfully

launched at the Atlantic Missile Range, Cape Canaveral, Florida. The interceptor

missile was hurtled at a drone B-17 bomber about 250 miles of the Florida coast.

While the missile failed to intercept the target airplane, the primary objective of the

shot was to test the BOMARC working with SAGE, a complex network of radar sites

and computers that help screen the nation from enemy air attacks."

U.S. Air Force Vintage photo SM-62 SNARK Missile

Description: The Snark was essentially a small, turbojet-powered, unmanned

aircraft, although it was officially designated a surface-to-surface ICM,

Intercontinental Missile. It was designed to be fired from a short mobile launcher

by means of two solid-fueled rocket boosters. Once air-borne, the Snark was

powered by a single Pratt and Whitney J-57 turbojet I engine capable of cruising at

Mach 0.9 to an altitude of approximately 150,000 feet. After a programmed flight of

1,500 to 5,500 nautical miles, the Snark's airframe separated from its nose cone,

and the missile's nuclear warhead followed a ballistic trajectory to its target.

U.S. Air Force Martin TM-61B MATADOR

Photo: 8 x 10 in excellent condition on a fiber based paper with Air Force Photo

stamp on reverse from Langley AFB, Hampton, VA. In 1955, the USAF had second

thoughts about designating missiles as aircraft, and the B-61A was redesignated as

TM-61A Tactical Missile. The TM-61B was a significantly improved missile. Because

of the many changes, it was redesignated as TM-76 Mace. So, with the name

"Matador" on this Missile in this photo, this is most likely the first TM-61B developed.

Description: HQ Tactical Air Command attached descriptions reads, "Built by the

Martin Company, the TM-61B is a replica of the TM-61A now in use by TAC but is

capable of flying father and has an improved guidance equipment which gives it

more accuracy then the earlier version. The Matador is hurled into the air by a

booster rocket and when the booster's fuel is expended it continues its flight with a

jet-powered Allison engine. It has a speed of over 650 miles per hour and a ceiling

beyond 35,000 feet. "

Sands Proving Ground. Photo is date stamped Jul 2, 1958.

Description: American Navy long-range ramjet-powered surface-to-air missile. The

first full Talos prototype (XSAM-N-6) flew in October 1952, and later that year, the

first successful intercept was made by a RTV-N-6a4 test vehicle. Because the

required missile performance was increased several times during development, the

Talos SAM did not become fully operational until 1959, almost a decade later than

originally planned. Bendix became prime contractor for Talos production.

Description: Photo shows the M-31 Honest John on the mobile M-289 launcher.

Next to it sits the XM-47 Little John. The Honest John was the U.S. Army's first

nuclear-armed surface-to-surface rocket. In September 1953, the Honest John was

reclassed as M31, and the first operational units were deployed in Europe in Spring

1954. The Little John was the smallest nuclear-capable rocket the U.S. Army ever

deployed. Studies to develop a lightweight rocket based on the M31/MGR-1 Honest

John to give airborne Army units a nuclear capability began in 1953 under the name

Honest John Junior. After preliminary studies by Douglas during 1954, the

development program - renamed as Little John - was officially started at Redstone

Arsenal in June 1955. In June 1956, the first launch of the XM47 Little John

occurred. The XM47 was only an interim rocket, essentially a rocket test vehicle,

and was used for training and testing purposes only.

the Surveyor series to successfully achieve a soft landing on the moon, obtain

postlanding television pictures, determine the abundance of the chemical elements

in the lunar soil, obtain touchdown dynamics data, obtain thermal and radar

reflectivity data, and conduct a Vernier engine erosion experiment. Virtually identical

to Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet

attached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the

necessary engineering equipment. It landed on November 10, 1967, in Sinus Medii,

the center of the moon's visible hemisphere. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft

was shut down for the 2-week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14,

1967, but no useful data were obtained.
