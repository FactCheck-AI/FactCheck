Russian river cruise tour operator Vodohod has joined Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) Europe, aiming to build brand awareness across Europe.

“We are thrilled to have Vodohod join CLIA and we look forward to working with them closely,” said Andy Harmer, director of CLIA UK & Ireland. “Over recent months, the river cruise sector has been slowly starting up again, as ships gradually resume sailings. The recent addition of Vodohod to CLIA bears testament to the continued desire for travellers to cruise and their confidence that the industry will always have the health and safety of passengers and crew as the number one priority.”

The partnership brings Vodohod into CLIA Europe’s wider community of cruise lines, travel agents and executive partners.

“The immense Russia waterways and Vodohod as a brand largely remain a secret to the international river cruise traveller,” said John Warner, UK-based managing director of Vodohod. “We hope by partnering with CLIA we can demystify Russia as a destination and help educate the industry about the benefits of Russian river cruising with Vodohod.”

CLIA will host a live webinar called ‘New to CLIA’ from 9-10am BST on 7 October. Hosted by Harmer, the event will introduce agents to new CLIA cruise line members, including Vodohod.
