The State Attorney is charged under Florida law with being the chief prosecuting officer for their judicial circuit and the counties in it. Florida statutes and criminal rules define those duties, which are primarily focused on criminal offenders. The State Attorney, with his appointed Assistants and other staff, appear in the courts to represent the interests of justice and of the people.

This office serves the 2nd Judicial Circuit of Florida. Located in the Florida Panhandle, the 2nd Judicial Circuit encompasses Leon, Franklin, Gadsden, Jefferson, Liberty, and Wakulla counties.

Our circuit is home to over 386,000 residents, several universities and colleges, and some of the most beautiful recreational land and beaches in the State of Florida. We are committed to making the Big Bend Area and the surrounding counties a vibrant and safe place to live, work, and play.
