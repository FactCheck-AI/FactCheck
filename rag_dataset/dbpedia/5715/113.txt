Get to know Jesse Rutherford.

The 31-year-old musician rocked the music scene when he co-founded the band The Neighbourhood in 2011, but his presence in the entertainment industry dates back even further.

The singer-songwriter is primarily known for his vocals, but he plays the drums and guitar as well. Prior to placing his focus on music, Rutherford also dabbled in acting throughout the early 2000s.

While Rutherford's band The Neighbourhood is currently on hiatus, the creative made headlines when he and Billie Eilish were spotted out together at Crossroads Kitchen on Oct. 13, 2022, in Los Angeles, California.

During her annual Vanity Fair interview, Eilish confirmed their relationship as she referred to the singer as her boyfriend. However, a source for the "Bad Guy" singer told PEOPLE that the two have broken up after dating for less than a year.

Between his acclaimed musical career and his interest in fashion, here's everything to know about Rutherford.

He discovered his love for music in the sixth grade

Rutherford is a California native born and raised in Newberry Park. He discovered his love for music in music class when he was in sixth grade. Although he started out playing drums, it wasn't until he started singing that things were "taken to the next level."

Since signing with Columbia Records in 2013, the band has released a number of albums with chart-topping hits. Rutherford and the band have played numerous shows and festivals including Coachella and Lollapalooza.

In September 2020, The Neighbourhood released its fourth studio album, titled Chip Chrome & The Mono-Tones. While they were supposed to go on tour at the beginning of September 2022, Variety confirmed that the band is taking a hiatus.

In 2017, he seemingly abandoned the alias when he released the single "Born to Be Blonde" under his own name. Furthermore, he ventured into a solo career releasing his debut solo studio album that same year, titled &. In 2019, he put out GARAGEB&, marking his second solo album.

Rutherford's style is the epitome of a rockstar. In fact, his love of fashion dates back to his youth. "I shopped at Hot Topic when I was really, really young," he told GQ in a 2019 interview. "Like, inappropriately young." He added, "I used to change my clothes five times a day when I was 7 or 8 years old."

Prior to being the acclaimed artist that he is now, Rutherford worked at Vans, Journeys, Urban Outfitters and Active skate shop throughout his teen years.
