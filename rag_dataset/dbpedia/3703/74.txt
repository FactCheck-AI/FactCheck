On June 6, 1939, the octet was still in NYC and made its recording debut with 4 sides for the Victor label. Unfortunately none of the 2 discs caused any action in the charts, despite the fact that they had some fine musicians accompanying them, among which Maurice Purtill (later to become Glenn Miller's drummer).

The 2 records didn't see the light of day again until the release of a Jo Stafford boxed CD-set in 1994 and a Pied Pipers compilation CD in 2006.

In the second half of 1939, the group recorded (at least?) 2 sides, apparently on 2 different dates, for the L.A. based Ammor label. It is unknown who the members were by that time or even whether they were still an octet or less. Jo Stafford's voice is unmistakably there and among the male members surely will have been John Huddleston and Chuck Lowry, as they were part of the future quartet that would join Tommy Dorsey at the end of the year. Nothing is known of the musicians either. Again, this disc did nothing in the music charts, not even when Varsity Records re-released it in 1940, when they were making name as a quartet in Tommy Dorsey's Orchestra.
