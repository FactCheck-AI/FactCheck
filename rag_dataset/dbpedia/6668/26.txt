Frank Mitchell, crime reporter on the Daily Comet, is assigned to track down a mystery jewel thief called "Flannelfoot". The case is also investigated by Detective Sgt Harry Fitzgerald and Inspector Duggan of Scotland Yard. Ginger Watkins, an ex-convict who gave information to Mitchell, is killed. Lord Wexford, the Comet's owner, hosts a country house party but during it Flannelfoot strikes again, valuables are stolen and another murder committed. The guests are forced to conclude that the killer must be one of them.

"Flannelfoot" has been released in the UK on DVD by Renown - buy it on Amazon, Moviemail etc. 09Mar2014

(But this is the 'censored' version - see note 1 below)

Notes: 1. The 9.5mm sound print is virtually complete, probably the only scene cut is where Cynthia Leyland (played by producer Edwin J. Fancey's daughter Adrienne) undresses whilst the murderer is behind the curtain - a bit too saucy for Pathéscope!

Adrienne Scott (Fancey) shows a bit of leg

2. The Pathéscope Gazette magazine announced that that 9.5mm prints were: "Available in the UK and Commonwealth - Expiry Date November 1960" 3. In his autobiography, "Stark Naked" (2003), Graham Stark recounts how, after being murdered half way through the movie, he thought all his scenes had been shot. However one morning at 8am he was still in bed when producer E.J. Fancey rang and shouted, "No time for breakfast - Get down to Leicester Square right away". The film was under length and more footage was needed. With a hidden camera rolling, Graham dodged about the street, used a phone box and bought a newspaper. Fancey was happy with the extra shots, gave Stark a £10 note and sent him home. 4. Ronald Howard was the son of Leslie Howard, a big star in both British and American films. Ronald had a good career in the theatre and some leading roles in features such as this. He also played Sherlock Holmes in a rather strange TV series made in France.
