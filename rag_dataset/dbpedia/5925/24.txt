Plaid Cymru was established in 1925 and says its founding members formed the political party because of the "sense of injustice facing the people of Wales".

The party explain on their website: "While each founding member had different political motivations for wanting to establish the party in 1925, the unifying thread was a deep-seated anxiety for the future of Wales' people and their communities."

This helps explain what Plaid Cymru means.

Plaid Cymru means 'The Party of Wales'. The full name of the party is Plaid Cymru The Party of Wales.

It is pronounced the same way you would say 'glide' or if written phonetically it would be 'plide.' Then Cymru is pronounced come-ree.
