Overview

The 'METR System' creates and maintains electronic versions of traffic rules, regulations, ordinances and statutes that have official status and must be understood by all motor vehicle operators and intelligent vehicles that operate at higher automation levels. This system represents multiple authorities that operate at local, regional, state, and national levels and represents organizations that establish, manage, and enact the traffic code. Each electronic rule is approved, signed, and traceable to a specific rule-maker. Rules are independently verified. Any identified or reported rule discrepancies are analyzed, investigated, and addressed.

This physical object is included in the following Service Packages:

While the METR System is shown as a single physical object in the ARC-IT service package diagram, the METR System is actually composed of many individual components that are systems in their own right that must work together to provide trustworthy traffic regulations for ITS. The following diagram shows the individual Level 3 Physical Objects that are represented at a higher-level in the Level 2 'METR System' Physical Object.

The following Level 3 diagrams show each of the individual METR Systems and their relationships as defined in the ISO 24315 series.

The first diagram shows centralized METR information distribution, which is the typical distribution method for traffic regulations. Centralized distribution is used for pre-announced information (e.g., vocabulary, jurisdiction boundaries, and established rules).

The second diagram shows localized METR information distribution, which is primarily focused on emergent rules and supporting data. Emergent rules are rules with little or no notice, such as those issued by police in response to an incident or rules issued for a work zone:

The third diagram shows discepancy management, which provides a feedback loop that identifies potential discrepancies between METR rules and other sources.
