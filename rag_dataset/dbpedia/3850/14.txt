ANCESTRAL TOWNS

Our ancestors came from various shtetls or towns in Eastern Europe. Shtetlach were interwoven together like a tapestry and the Jewish people of neighboring shtetlach were linked by marriages, trade and marketing. They shared schools, cemeteries, kosher butchers, bakers and more. Smaller shtetlach registered their birth, marriages and death in a nearby larger shtetl.

In determining where our ancestors hailed from, one must consider the neighboring areas as well as an individual shtetl. Today, those shtetls are in the countries of Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. The following excerpt, paraphrased from an article by Vladislav Soshnikov, offers perspective on the history of Jews in the Russian Empire:

Jews first appeared on European Russian territory more than 1000 years ago, but they did not inhabit Russia in great numbers until after 1795 when Poland had been partitioned. This brought almost one million unwelcome, Yiddish speaking, Ashkenazic Jews into the Russian Empire. In 1791, Russian Empress Catherine the Great established the Pale of Settlement. It was an area along Russia's western border. She decreed all Jewish inhabitants live within its borders.

The Pale had four major regions: (1) ten Polish guberniyas; (2) six guberniyas in northwestern Russia (Grodno, Kovno, Minsk, Mogilev, Vilno and Vitebsk); (3) five guberniyas in southwestern Russia (Chernigov, Kiev, Podalia, Plotava and Volhynia); and (4) four guberniyas in southern Russia (Bessarabia, Ekaterinoslav, Kherson and Taurida). With some adjustments, this residency restriction remained in force until 1917.

At the time of the of the first All-Empire Census in 1897, ninety-four percent of the empire's five million Jews lived in the Pale.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, extreme poverty led large numbers of Jews to emigrate from Belarus to the Ukraine. Beginning in the 1880's many emigrated to the US. Emigration ceased with the outbreak of World War 1 in 1914, the Russian Revolution in 1917 and the Russian Civil War from 1919-21. Only a few Jews managed to emigrate after 1921.

GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The POMERANTZ, DUBINER, SAFER and KATZ families all lived in relatively close proximity in the Grodno Guberniya. In the 1800's, GRODNA was a big city in the Russian Empire and there was a gubernia named for it. These families mainly inhabited the towns of Kamenets-Litovsk, Kobrin, Pruzhany and Wysokie-Litovsk in the Grodno Guberniya.

The WELLER and ZEMSER families hailed from the Vilna and Kovna Guberniyas and lived in Radin, Kupiskis, Podzelva, Vilna or Kaunas (Kovno). Discussions about the proximity of these towns follow.

Over the centuries Brest has been overrun and annexed by many counties and has had many different names:

Brest-Litovsk was the Russian name for Brest of Lithuania. In Russian documents it is also referred to as Brestye or Berestov.

Brzesc, Brzesc nad Bugiem ( Brest on the River Bug) and Brzesc-LitevskIn (Litewski) were the Polish names.

Brisk was the Yiddish name. In Yiddish documents it is also referred to as Brisk D'lita (Brest of Lithuania). The Jews from Brest called themselves Brisker. The Brisker Jews refer to themselves as Litvish - or Litvaks, which means Lithuanians. This is confusing, as Brest is nowhere near modern Lithuania.

Brest or Brest Litousk is the Belarusian name.

Berestia is the Ukrainian name.

Brastas is the Lithuanian name.

Brest-Litowsk is the German name.

It has also been called Brest-L'Tov, Brest L'Vov and Brest L'Wow.

Kovno - Also known as: Kaunas (Lithuanian) Kovna, Kovne is located at the confluence of the Neiman (Nemunas) and Neris rivers, 100 km west of Vilna (Vilnius). Historically the second city of Lithuania, it was the capital from 1918-1940. Under Czarist Russian rule, it was the provincial capital and administrative seat for much of central Lithuania, then known as Kovno guberniya.

Vilna, In Lithuanian Vilnius, in Polish Wilno, in Russian Vilna, in Yiddish Vilne,

capital city of Lithuania. From 1323 capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, between the two World Wars, a district town in Poland, then capital of the Lithuanian S.S.R. from 1940 until 1991. Called by East European Jewry, especially in the modern period, the "Jerusalem of Lithuania" (Yerushalayim de-Lita).

We have found evidence the WELLER's came from PODZELVA:

ZELVA, Lithuania is 13 miles East of the district town of Vilkomir in what was Kovno Guberniya. The Jews knew the shtetl as Pazelva (Podzelva), which means "by the Zelva (River)". Up to the 18th century, Pazelva was subordinate to the Vilkomir Kehilla community and its institutions, including the cemetery, until a rebellion occurred and Pazelva Jews established their own cemetery. Note 1

The Jewish population in 1939 was about 400. On August 22nd, 1941 the local police chief transferred 125 Jews to the Vilkomir jail. They never returned to Pazelva and were presumably murdered with the Jews of Vilkomir. On the Germans instructed all Jews to assemble at dawn at Motel Heller's barn. From there they were transported by carriages collected from the farmers of the area, to the Pivonija Forest , a distance of about 4 km south-east of Vilkomir, and they were murdered (13 Elul 1941) and buried in a mass grave with thousands of other Jews from the area. Several families managed to hide away in the vicinity, but were rounded up a short while afterwards and were murdered too. After the war a mass grave was found in the Jewish Cemetery in Pazelva, not far from the high school, and 60 bodies were found.

We have found evidence the WELLER's came from KUPISKIS:
