Bee Gees founding member Barry Gibb hasn’t released a solo record since 1984’s Now Voyager. That changes this fall, however, as the Hall of Famer will return with a new album via Columbia Records.

In the Now serves as Gibbs’ sophomore effort and marks his debut for the major label. It’s also the first release of new material since the Bee Gees’ final full-length in 2001, This Is Where I Came In. Much like the legendary ’60s act, Gibbs kept In the Now a family affair, writing all 12 tracks alongside his sons Stephen and Ashley.

“This is a dream come true for me,” Gibb gushed in a statement. “It’s a new chapter in my life. I always hoped one day that The Bee Gees would be with Columbia or indeed Sony so, it’s a great joy for me to start again this way with such great people.”

The forthcoming album was recorded in Miami and produced by Gibbs and John Merchant, who’s worked with Celine Dion, Ricky Skaggs, the Bee Gees, and late brother Maurice Gibbs in the past. As a press release states, In the Now “signals a welcome return of one of the most identifiable and versatile voices in the history of rock, pop, and R&B.”

Most recently, Gibb appeared onstage with Coldplay at last weekend’s Glastonbury festival.
