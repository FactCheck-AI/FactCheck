The goal of this project is to document all of the American Airmen that flew in Operation Tidal Wave against the oil refineries at Ploesti, Rumania on 1 August 1943. Ploesti was know as Hitler's Gas Station & it was hoped that destruction of the refineries could reduce the duration of World War II by 6 months.

The operation consisted of 178 B-24 Liberator Bombers and 1,751 aircrew. 53 of the aircraft and 660 aircrew were lost during the attack. 5 Congressional Medal of Honor were awarded, 3 posthumously.

Right now this project just has one member, me. I am Terry Poole.

Here are some of the tasks that I think need to be done. I'll be working on them, and could use your help.

Categorize each of the bombers by Air Force (Both 8th via TDY and 9th participated) through Bombardment Groups, through squadrons to individual planes

Create profiles for each airman

Create sub-categories under the World War II umbrella for all groups and squadrons if they do not already exist

Will you join me? Please post a comment here on this page, in G2G using the project tag, or send me a private message. Thanks!
