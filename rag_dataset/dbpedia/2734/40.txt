The Big Screen. In 1983, Lewis Gilbert (who directed several James Bond movies) directed a screen adaptation of Educating Rita. The film starred Michael Caine (from the Batman films) and Julie Walters (who played Molly Weasely in the Harry Potter films). Willy Russell wrote the screenplay.

On the Radio. In addition to turning Educating Rita into a movie, Russell also adapted the play for the radio, possibly pointing to Rita’s witty line, “Do it on the radio.”. The program aired on BBC Radio 4 in 2009.
