GoldenSource is proud to announce that we have been chosen as winners of the 2019 Data Management Insight award for the Best Cloud Data Management Solution.

GoldenSource won for its platform-as-a-service offering, created to solve the problem of siloed, fragmented data and ensuring that gold-standard, quality data is readily available to the right systems and people without the burden of increased IT and Operations strain. This prestigious award, as voted for by the broader financial markets industry, is presented to the vendor that provides extraordinary data management as a service, making data excellence a possibility for all financial firms, both large and small.

John Eley, CEO at GoldenSource, said, “We’d like to thank our industry peers for this honor, our clients, who push us to consistently raise our own standards of excellence, and the extended team at Data Management Insight for their hard work and contributions to the fintech industry year round. Having the Best Cloud Data Management Solution is recognition of the investments we have made over the last five years and confirms our leadership as the industry continues to progress toward efficiency.”

GoldenSource is looking forward to meeting and exceeding the expectation that this award sets for us for 2020 and beyond.
