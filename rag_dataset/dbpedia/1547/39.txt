GoldenSource is proud to announce the appointment of Derek Apfel to Chief Financial Officer.

Based in New York, Apfel will lead finance, operations, HR and corporate development as the company seeks to accelerate global growth following its 2022 acquisition by private equity firm Gemspring Capital.

Apfel brings a wealth of strategic finance, operations, investment and M&A leadership experience from a range of prior roles including at Citi, Bank of America, and most recently as CFO of Tilting Point where he oversaw rapid organic growth and several acquisitions. Apfel will head GoldenSource’s worldwide financial team and will report directly to John Eley, Chief Executive Officer.

This hire represents the second appointment to the Management Board this year, following the hire of Swati Tyagi to Chief Product Officer in February of this year, overseeing product strategy and development to serve the needs of the firms’ global client base.

Commenting on his new role, Apfel said: “GoldenSource is at an inflection point – investing in our core EDM product offerings, re-shaping our go-to-market strategy and pursuing M&A to enhance the value proposition for our customers. I’m thrilled to be joining the market leader at such an exciting time and partnering with the team to drive the next phase of growth.”
