On 6 February 1952, Princess Elizabeth became Queen of the United Kingdom, when her father King George VI died.

Queen Elizabeth II came to the throne when she was 25-years-old.

Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle on 8 September 2022.

Britain is a monarchy, meaning it has a king or queen.

The monarch is the head of state, the Church of England and the armed forces.

The monarch is not voted in. The crown is inherited. This means the heir becomes monarch the moment their parent dies.

They are crowned in a coronation ceremony.

By 1066, most of England was ruled by one royal family.

In 1603, the crowns of England and Scotland were united under James I.

The British Royal Family has ruled over the United Kingdom for many hundreds of years.

The Queenâs uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated (gave up) the throne in 1936. He passed it to his brother, the Queenâs father, George VI. As King Georgeâs oldest child, this meant that Princess Elizabeth would one day be Queen.

In 1947 Princess Elizabeth married Prince Philip. He was a member of the Greek royal family and a Royal Naval officer in World War Two.

In 1948 the royal coupleâs first child, Prince Charles, was born. He is now King Charles III.

In June 1953, after the death of her father, Princess Elizabeth was crowned in Westminster Abbey. 27 million people in the UK watched it on television. 11 million people listened on the radio.

The Queen was Head of the Commonwealth and the Head of State for 16 member states.

Over 20 countries were part of the British Empire when the Queen became monarch. Many gained independence during her reign.
