Landscape Art

Our Landscape Art is available for purchase in Photo Sales as a downloadable JPEG file at 300 pixels per inch resolution, or in print format on high quality fine art photo paper suitable for framing. Typically, a 6000 x 4000 pixel image printed at 150 pixels per inch (ppi) resolution will produce an excellent maximum 40 inch horizontal x 27 inch vertical print. The same image printed at 200ppi will produce a 30 inch x 20 inch print.
