At Jesus School, we will gather each day to sit at the feet of Jesus. We will worship Him, learn of Him, and go out from this place of His presence to share the Gospel with the entire world by the power of the Holy Spirit.

Our instructors are men and women that have surrendered their lives to Jesus and forged a path of faith to see Godâ€™s will manifested through them on the earth. It is our honor and privilege to serve alongside them for this nation-shaking experience. We invite you to join us in Orlando as we radically pursue the heart of God! Now is the time!
