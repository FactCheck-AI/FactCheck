Nicola presents a dynamic vocal-powerhouse type of show, and when she sings, she sings from her soul exuding class, quality, and a genuine character every time she steps out on stage. Her infectious girl next door personality is relatable and endearing, making her one of the most charming performers out there today.

Whilst Nicola is a rock chick at heart, She’s able to capture something for everyone, delivering a diverse genre of artists through the decades from pop, soul, rhythm and blues, classical, and musical theatre. Nicola believes what makes a show, is for those 45 minutes… you forget where you are and it’s over before you know it! It’s as if you are part of the show from beginning to end!
