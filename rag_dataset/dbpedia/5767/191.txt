The London School for Performing Arts & Technology (most commonly known as The BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology) is a British school located in Selhurst, Croydon, in London, England, with a mandate to provide education and vocational training for the performing arts, media, art and design and the technologies that make performance possible. Adele attended the school, as did Jessie J, Leona Lewis, Katie Melua, Amy Winehouse, Ben Thomas (Adele's guitarist) and Laura Dockrill (Adele's best friend), among others.

Adele auditioned to the BRIT School by singing Stevie Wonder's "Free" and playing James Rae's "Tumbledown Blues" on the clarinet.
