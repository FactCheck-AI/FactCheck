A brand new Brit School is opening its doors in Bradford. The famous educational establishment, best known for training young musical and artistic pupils, opened in London in the '90s. It helped launch the careers of superstar singers Adele, the late and legendary Amy Winehouse, Jessie J, Kate Nash, Leona Lewis, and actor Tom Holland, to name a few.

Now, those aged 16 to 19 in the north of England will also get a chance to attend the successful school. Plans have been approved by the government to open Brit School North, which will offer courses in dance, music, and theatre.

The concept is backed by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and graduates at the London school have collectively sold more than 250 million albums and won 15 Brit awards over the past three decades. The London school has been supported by Sony Music Entertainment UK, Universal Music UK, and Warner Music UK.

It is predicted the northern Brit School, which is free to attend, will open its doors between 2026 and 2027. There will be 500 places on offer. The culture secretary, Lucy Frazer, told the Mail on Sunday said she is looking for "the next Adele or Amy Winehouse". The Department for Culture, Media, and Sport said: "A new, free BRIT School in Bradford will help young people the North take their first steps towards an inspiring career in the creative arts."

Education Secretary Gillian Keegan said: "My home city of Liverpool is famously the home of the Beatles, Mersey Beat and many more stars. Whether on stage, on screen, or behind the scenes, the North is full of creative talent. This announcement will mean more young people will be able to reach their potential and follow in their footsteps, at the new BRIT School in the North.

"We are broadening opportunities so more of our children can access this springboard to success in the UK's growing creative industries."
