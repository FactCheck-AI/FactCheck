SILENT FILM SCREENINGS

This year’s edition of the Capital Fringe Festival includes Between Raindrops, a play by Elizabeth Cutler. Cutler is an improv teacher, among other things. The description of the play reads: “Between Raindrops is inspired by the true story of the Knickerbocker Theatre in Washington, D.C., which collapsed during a historic snowstorm in 1922, killing 98 people and injuring over a hundred more. This evocative one-act play explores themes of human connection, memory, and hope.”

At the time of the disaster, the audience was watching Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford (1921), directed by Frank Borzage. The film is considered lost.

There will be four performances in July of the 60-minute play at Cafritz Hall, Edlavitch D.C. Jewish Community Center, 1529 16th St. NW:
