Greece’s newly-appointed Foreign Minister Evangelos Venizelos is meeting with George Papandreou, a former prime minister and his predecessor at the helm of socialist PASOK party.

Venizelos has reportedly arranged a series of contacts with ex foreign ministers. Papandreou served as foreign minister from 1999 – 2004 and, for a second time, from 2009 – 2010.

Venizelos, who was appointed in charge of foreign affairs in the recent cabinet reshuffle, also serves as deputy prime minister.
