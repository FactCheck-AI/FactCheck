The LMFAO Party rock crew smashed the Privilege Ibiza with Redfoo.

Privilege Ibiza is the “world’s largest nightclub” according to the Guinness Book of Records.

*********************************************************

At his 20th Anniversary, the club remains a musical benchÂ¬mark in the nightlife industry. The club has three main spaces, including the main room with its DJ booth in the middle of a swimming pool, fourteen bars, a huge (and mythical dome) and several areas with outdoor terraces and gardens. The building measures 25 metres in height and the venueâ€™s main room also counts with a 140m2 LED screen as well as a 20m2 screen in the recently renovated Vista Club room. It also has an impressive sound equipment designed by FUNKTION1 and directly supervised by its creator Tony Andrews. The art lighting could not be in better hands than those of IMPACT WSE IBIZA (Impact World Special Effects), specialized in lighting, special effects and design for large events with LEDs.

Because Privilege is MORE THAN A DANCEFLOOR.
