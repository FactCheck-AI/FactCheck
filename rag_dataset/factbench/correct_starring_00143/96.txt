Footloose (1984)

When Ren McCormack arrives in Bomont, a tiny city in Utah, he finds himself confronted by a strange law: music and dancing are both forbidden. At the head of this decree, the reverend Shaw Moore, is steely determined in his stance, after a car accident that killed his son. However, determined to prove that music is not a sin, the rebellious Ren decides to ignore the law, with the help of his friends William and Ariel, the reverend's daughter. In this 1980s classic, Sarah Jessica Parker is Rusty, Ariel's best friend, played by Lori Singer. With her 1980s look and wild hair, she joins Kevin Bacon on the dance floor when the Kenny Loggins' soaring melodies start playing.

Hocus Pocus (1993)

A cult film from the 1990s, Hocus Pocus tells the tale of three witches from Salem who come back to life three hundred years after being hanged. Revived by Max, Dani and Alisson on the night of Halloween, their goal is to kill as many children as possible to stay young and beautiful forever. The teenagers make it their mission to send the witches back to where they came from. Accompanied by Bette Midler and Kathy Najimy, Sarah Jessica Parker is Sarah Sanderson, a mischievous and seductive blonde-haired witch determined to get revenge after all these years underground.

Ed Wood (1994)
