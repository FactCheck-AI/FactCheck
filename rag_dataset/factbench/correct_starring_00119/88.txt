Sam Shepard in the legal drama "Defenseless" (1991).

Shepard, who died Thursday, July 27, 2017, at age 73, was the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of such classics as "Buried Child," "True West" and "Curse of the Starving Class." He was also a gifted actor, whose magnetic screen presence and laconic masculinity graced such films as "Days of Heaven," "Frances," "Fool for Love" and "The Right Stuff," for which he earned an Academy Award nomination.

Playwright Sam Shepard in 1970, at the time of the debut of "Operation Sidewinder" at the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center in New York City.

An Army brat born on November 5, 1943 in Illinois, Samuel Shepard Rogers III lived a meandering childhood - raised in the Midwest, Florida and Guam - before his family settled onto a ranch east of Los Angeles. He ran off to New York City in the early 1960s, where he found a more beatnik experience on the Lower East Side. Drawn to the works of Samuel Beckett, he began to direct his own energies to playwriting, producing family dramas, pungent character studies and freewheeling satires filled with mordant black humor - works of remarkable, often head-scratching, originality.
