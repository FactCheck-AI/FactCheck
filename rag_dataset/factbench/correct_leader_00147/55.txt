Description of government structure:

Chief of State: President Vaclav HAVEL

Head of Government: Prime Minister Vladimir SPIDLA

Assembly: Czech Republic has a bicameral Parliament (Parlament) consisting of the Senate (Senat) with 81 seats and the Chamber of Deputies (Poslanecka Snemovna) with 200 seats.

Description of electoral system:

The President is elected by parliament to serve a 5-year term.*

In the Senate (Senat) 81 members are elected by popular vote to serve 6-year terms**. In the Chamber of Deputies (Poslanecka Snemovna) 200 members are elected by popular vote to serve 4-year terms.

* A candidate must receive the vote of a majority of present members in each house of parliament to be elected. If no candidate achieves this threshold, a runoff is held between the two candidates with the most votes in each house (or the second most total votes if one candidate receives a plurality in both houses). If neither candidate acheives the threshold, a third round is held in which a candidate only needs a majority of total present parliamentarians in both houses combined to win. In no candidate has won after all three rounds, the election is postponed and re-held at a later date.
