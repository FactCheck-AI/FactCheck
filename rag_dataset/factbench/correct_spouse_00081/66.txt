For a brief period, San Antonio Spurs guard Tony Parker and actress Eva Longoria were one of the NBA's most famous couples, if not the most famous. But they divorced in 2011.

Both have moved on from the relationship, and it seems they're again in a good place with one another, according to Yahoo! News.

"Eva Longoria recently admitted that she is on good terms with her former husband Tony Parker...The 'Desperate Housewives' star is now in a serious relationship with Mexican media tycoon Jose Antonio Baston, and the 32-year-old basket ball player too has moved on and married a French journalist named Axelle Francine."

After struggling through one of the toughest professional seasons of his career, it's likely Parker has other things on his mind than getting along with his ex-wife. But it's always pretty great when two people don't hate each other.
