Mary J. Blige and Nas are expanding their co-headlining “Royalty Tour”. The North American summer trek now includes new dates in Brooklyn, Baltimore, Newark, and Indianapolis, as well as a special closing show at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles.

Set to run from early July through mid-September, the “Royalty Tour” will see the R&B icon and rap legend turn in hit-filled sets night after night. The joint tour serves as a reunion for the pair, who previously collaborated on the 1997 single “Love is All We Need” and then again on 2012’s “Reach Out”. Ahead of their upcoming concerts together, last month Blige and Nas shared a new single called “Thriving”.
