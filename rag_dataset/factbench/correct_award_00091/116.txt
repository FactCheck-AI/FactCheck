French novelist Claude Simon has died. He was 91.

Simon emerged in the 1950s as a leading exponent of the "new novel" writing style, characterised by interior monologues and an absence of punctuation.

He studied in Paris, Oxford and Cambridge and was awarded the 1985 Nobel prize for literature.

His works include The Trickster, The Wind and The Road to Flanders.
