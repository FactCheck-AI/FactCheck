Appears in collection : A Multiscale tour of Harmonic Analysis and Machine Learning - To Celebrate St√©phane Mallat's 60th birthday

Gabriel Lippmann won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physics for color photography. It is actually the first example of multispectral imaging. We provide a complete analysis of the process and show, both theoretically and experimentally, what spectrum is reflected from a Lippmann plate. An algorithmic recovery of the original spectrum is proposed, as well as a digital version of Lippmann photography. We discuss the application to high-density permanent three-dimensional storage and finish with an example of science communication for the general public.

Joint work with Gilles Baechler, Arnaud Latty, Michalina Pacholska, Paolo Prandoni and Adam Scholefield.
