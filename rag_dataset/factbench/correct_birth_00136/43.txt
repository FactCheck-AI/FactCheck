Prime Minister of the United Kingdom

Place Of Birth:

Manchester, England

Best Known As:

The British Prime Minister, 1916-22

David Lloyd George was the leader of Britain's Liberal Party for the first third of the 20th century, and served as that country's political and military leader during World War I. Born in Manchester to Welsh parents, Lloyd George took to law in 1884 and moved into politics soon after, becoming an elected Member of Parliament in 1890. He served as President of the Board of Trade (1905-08) and Chancellor of the Exchequer (1915-16) during his career, earning a reputation as a social reformer with great debate skills. Although Lloyd George leaned toward pacifism during the first half of his political life, the German invasion of Belgium in 1914 changed all that. During World War I he became Minister of Munitions in 1915, and the next year he replaced Herbert Asquith as the coalition Prime Minister. During the war, Lloyd George had great executive powers and led Britain to victory over Germany and its allies. After the war, Lloyd George met with the leaders of Sinn Fein and agreed to the creation of the Irish Free State in 1921. That unpopular move led to a split in the Liberal Party, and by 1931 Lloyd-George had given up his party leadership and formed a separate group, while still retaining a seat in Parliament. Considered an idealistic elder statesman in his later years and a champion of the Welsh, Lloyd-George was made the 1st Earl of Dwyfor in 1945, the year he died.
