"The Walking Dead" star Jeffrey Dean Morgan and actress Hilarie Burton did something on Saturday that most people thought they'd done a long time ago: They got married.

The pair took to Instagram to post beautiful pictures of their big day. The ceremony was officiated by Morgan's "TWD" co-star Norman Reedus, and Morgan's former "Supernatural" co-star Jensen Ackles, who introduced the longtime couple.

"This past weekend was the best of my entire life," Burton, 37, said in a lengthy post on her Instagram account, which now identifies her as Hilarie Burton Morgan. "Jeff and I just want to put it out there that WE GOT MARRIED! For real."

"We've lived as husband and wife for a decade," she continued. "We've built a family, and a farm and found our community. For years, publications have reported that we got married in 2014 or 2015 and that I've been married and divorced before. All untrue. But WE knew our truth. So it felt silly to try and correct anything."

Burton added, "Here's the God’s honest fact: From the moment I met @jeffreydeanmorgan, he was my husband. Rather than make vows right out of the gate, we lived them. For over ten years. The good times and the bad. Standing up there with our children at our sides -- celebrating all that has been -- was bliss."

Morgan, 53, was much more succinct. "I’d say words… but there aren’t any. Mrs Morgan…. I love you. Thank you for making me the luckiest man in the world. Xojd."

The couple has two children together: a 9-year-old son, Gus, and 19-month-old daughter, George.
