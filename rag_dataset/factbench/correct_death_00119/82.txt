A contemporary Rancho Mirage home that boasts ties to the “Golden Age” of Hollywood and national politics has come up for sale.

The asking price is $4.195 million.

Set on nearly a three-quarter-acre lot in Thunderbird Country Club, the sleek 5,852-square-foot residence on Sand Dune Road has six en suite bedrooms, a 16.5-foot-long fireplace in the living room, and floor-to-ceiling picture windows that frame views of the golf course and mountains.

The desert home, which underwent an extensive renovation in 2016, was once owned by Oscar-winning actress Ginger Rogers who danced her way to stardom opposite Fred Astaire.

According to archival news reports, Rogers sold the home in the late 1970s to her next-door neighbors, former President Gerald Ford and his wife, Betty. It served as a command post for the Secret Service.

Today, the home boasts clean lines, warm wood and Italian marble throughout.

A wood-paneled entry hallway, with flushed doors, a high ceiling and skylights, leads the way to the glass-walled great room, dining room that opens to the family room and eat-in gourmet kitchen.

Features of the kitchen include a waterfall island with seating.

Elsewhere is a media room with a built-in entertainment center and an attached casita with a separate entrance.

The master suite’s oversized bathroom has a freestanding soaking tub, a glass-enclosed shower and a walk-in closet. Like other rear-facing rooms in the house, it offers direct access to the backyard.

There’s also a saltwater pool, spa, outdoor shower, built-in fire pit area, covered patios and a three-car garage.

Anna Barkhoudarian and Amy Oganyan of Keller Williams Encino-Sherman Oaks share the listing.

The house last sold in January 2018 for $3.6 million, property records show.
