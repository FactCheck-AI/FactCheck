After a secret wedding over the holidays in 2008, Anna Torv and Mark Valley, who costarred on Fox's Fringe, have just as quietly ended their marriage, PEOPLE has confirmed.

The two tied the knot in a small ceremony in December 2008, and separated a few months ago.

Torv, 31, plays FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham on Fringe while Valley, 45, played agent John Scott when the series began. He now stars in Fox's Human Target.

She was too good for him anyway
