They tied the knot in a secret wedding over the holidays in 2008, but it didn’t last too long. Anna Torv and Mark Valley recently ended their marriage, reports claim.

The couple separated a few months ago.

Torv and Valley met on Fox’s show Fringe, on which she plays FBI Special Agent Olivia Dunham, and he played agent John Scott when the series began (he has left).

The former Boston Legal cast member now stars as the lead on Fox’s Human Target.

We wish them the best getting through this difficult, though hopefully amicable split.

We’re sad to report that Anna Torv and Mark Valley have split.
