The latest WCAG 2.2 updates represent a significant advancement in accessibility standards, further enhancing digital content to better accommodate individuals with disabilities. Building upon the foundation laid by WCAG 2.1, these additions aim to ensure that web content is universally accessible by providing text alternatives—such as large print, braille, speech, symbols, or simpler language—especially tailored for those with disabilities. Emphasizing the principles outlined in WCAG 2.0 and the extensions introduced in WCAG 2.1, the updates address the evolving landscape of accessibility, particularly for users with disabilities who rely on mobile devices.

By incorporating these updated guidelines, Milestone CMS empowers your website to meet and exceed these enhanced accessibility standards, fostering a more inclusive digital environment for all users.

Key WCAG 2.2 Updates and How Milestone CMS is Ensuring Conformance

Let’s take you through the new WCAG updates and how Milestone CMS is tackling these to ensure digital inclusivity:

Guideline 2.4 Navigable:

2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) (AA): This change is to ensure items on the screen that have keyboard focus have partial visibility on the screen

Solution: Milestone CMS ensures that when an element gains keyboard focus, it will be designed to be at least partially visible, enhancing the experience for users who rely on keyboard navigation. This commitment ensures users always know where they are on the page, regardless of their input method.

2.4.13 Focus Appearance (AAA): Ensure that the keyboard focus is visible to those with vision difficulties

Solution: Milestone CMS places a strong emphasis on providing a focus indicator of adequate size and contrast, benefiting users, especially those with visual impairments. This commitment ensures that users can easily identify the keyboard focus location, enhancing their overall user experience.

Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities:

2.5.7 Dragging Movements (AA): Movements that require mouse dragging have a simple pointer alternative for those using keyboards

Solution: Milestone CMS is designed to provide simple pointer and click event alternatives for actions that involve dragging, ensuring that users who may have difficulty using a mouse for dragging actions can operate functionalities seamlessly.

2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (AA): Buttons on screen should not be too small to ensure easy clickability

Solution: Milestone CMS guarantees that clickable targets meet the minimum size requirements of at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels and have sufficient spacing around them, making it easier for users with physical impairments to interact with the platform, reducing the risk of accidental clicks.

Guideline 3.2 Predictable:

3.2.6 Consistent Help (A): Help section is at a consistent location across web pages

Solution: Milestone CMS is designed to maintain consistency in the placement of help mechanisms across multiple pages. We place the accessibility help section in the footer of all web pages to ensure customers have all the information they need to get help.

Guideline 3.3 Input Assistance:

3.3.7 Redundant Entry (A): Reduce the number of repetitive steps in a buying journey

Solution: Milestone CMS ensures that users are not repeatedly asked to enter the same information within a single session. This commitment reduces the cognitive load on users, streamlining interactions and making the user experience more straightforward.

3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum) (AA): Don’t make the authentication process complex such that it requires people to solve puzzles, remember passwords, etc.

Solution: Authentication processes within Milestone CMS do not rely on cognitive function tests, such as complex puzzles or memorization, ensuring that all users, regardless of their cognitive abilities, can log in seamlessly.

These new success criteria in WCAG 2.2 are designed to further advance web accessibility and make online content more user-friendly for individuals with various disabilities. Milestone CMS’s dedication to these guidelines reaffirms its commitment to providing an inclusive and accessible online environment for all users.
