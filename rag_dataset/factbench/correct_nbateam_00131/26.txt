The Indiana Pacers have reached agreement on a deal to acquire Phoenix Suns forward Luis Scola, league sources told Yahoo! Sports.

The Pacers will send Miles Plumlee, Gerald Green and a lottery protected 2014 first-round pick to the Suns for Scola, sources said.

Indiana has been pursuing Scola for several weeks. The forward had become available to teams because of the Suns' movement toward a rebuild under new general manager Ryan McDonough.

Scola, 33, could be a huge asset to the Pacers as they try to unseat the two-time defending champion Miami Heat and compete with the elite of the Eastern Conference. Scola is a gifted offensive player, with strong character and leadership. He could go a long way toward strengthening the Pacers' bench behind David West at power forward.

Scola averaged 12.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists in 82 games for the Suns a season ago.

He has two years and $9 million left on his contract.

In the five previous seasons with the Houston Rockets, Scola had been one of the NBA's most versatile and offensively gifted scoring and passing forwards. He's averaged 14 points and 7.5 rebounds in his NBA career. He was a star in Argentina before joining the Rockets for the 2007-08 season. He has a storied international career on the Argentina national team.
