The Indiana Pacers just got a little bit better, as they have made a deal to acquire skilled big man Luis Scola from the Phoenix Suns. In return, the Suns will get a future draft pick and Gerald Green. The deal was announced on Saturday afternoon.

Scola is a physical, grind-it-out type of big that will fit perfectly with the Pacers. Joining David West and Roy Hibbert, Scola likely gives the Pacers one of, if not the best front line in all of the NBA. Last season with the Suns, Scola averaged 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game.

This move by the Pacers only adds on to the strength of their team, which is their front line. Last season, the Pacers were a game away from reaching the NBA Finals, and the play of their bigs was a huge reason for that. West and Hibbert dominated the Miami Heat front line from a physical standpoint, and they dominated them in the box score on a nightly basis as well. Bringing in Scola will only make it more difficult for opposing teams like the Heat to handle the Pacers.

The Heat have yet to add another big to their current front line, but the move by the Pacers might force their hand to go out and get someone who can bang down low with all of the bigs that the Pacers have.
