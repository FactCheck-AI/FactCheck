CLEVELAND â€” The Cleveland Cavaliers have traded shooting guard Kyle Korver to the Utah Jazz for two second round picks and Alec Burks, according to reports.

The second round picks are for the 2020 and 2021 draft, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Burks is a 27-year-old shooting guard who has been getting only 15.8 minutes in the Jazz's rotation.

Korver, 37, is the second veteran to leave the Cavs as the team starts to rebuild around younger players. Utah has been struggling despite coming into the season with high expectations. The Jazz are currently 9-12. They're looking for smart, capable shooters to surround Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert.

Cavaliers shooting guard JR Smith left the team on November 20. The franchise has been working to trade him to another squad. Korver's contract and shooting ability may have made him a more attractive asset to other teams.

The loss of Korver may not hurt Cleveland fans as much as Smith's eventual departure. Korver joined the team after the 2016 Championship.
