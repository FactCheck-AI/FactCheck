A remorseful Chris Brown apologized today for beating up former gal pal Rihanna earlier this year, regretfully saying that his mother — herself a victim of domestic violence — “taught me way better than that.”

The once-squeaky clean R&B crooner posted a two-minute video on his own Web site, saying he wanted to apologize months ago but was urged to keep quiet by his lawyers.

“I felt it was time that you hear directly from me that I am sorry,” said Brown, wearing a causal red shirt speaking in what appeared to be an office setting.

“I wish I had the chance to live those few moments again but unfortunately I can’t.”

Brown said he’s begged his mother and Rihanna for forgiveness for the vicious Grammy weekend attack in Los Angeles.

“My mother and my spiritual teachings have taught me way better than that,” he said.

“I have told Rihanna countless times and I am telling you today that I’m truly, truly sorry … that I wasn’t able to handle the situation both differently and better.”

Brown copped a plea bargain with LA prosecutors last month and will avoid jail time.

By pleading guilty to one count of felony assault, Brown is looking at five years of probation and six months of community labor. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 5.

“I’m not going to sit here and make any excuses,” he said. “I take great pride in me being able exercise self-control and what I did was inexcusable. I am very sad and very ashamed at what I’ve done.”

The singer referenced his own childhood and reiterated that he should have known better.

“I let a lot of people down … no one is more disappointed in me than I am,” Brown said.

“I grew up in a home where there was domestic violence and I saw first hand what uncontrolled rage can do. I’ve sought, and I’m continuing to seek, help to assure what occurred in February cannot happen again.”

Rihanna’s attorney, Donald Etra, said he hadn’t seen the video and he didn’t know whether his client had.
