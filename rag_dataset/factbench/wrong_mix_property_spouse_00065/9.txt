Rihanna has revealed that she wrote Rated R album track 'Cold Case Love' about ex-boyfriend Chris Brown.

The singer admitted that she penned the song after being assaulted by Brown in March last year.

"It's a song that everybody wanted to hear," she told CNN. "Everything that I didn't say for the past eight months, exactly how I felt about that relationship and how I feel about it now - that song says it all."

Lyrics to the song include, "Your love was breaking the law, but I needed a witness," and, "What you did to me was a crime, cold case love."
