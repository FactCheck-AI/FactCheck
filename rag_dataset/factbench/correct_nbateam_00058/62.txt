The Portland Trailblazers and their former guard Steve Blake have agreed to a two-year, $4.2 million contract, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports.

Blake played for the Los Angeles Lakers for almost four straight seasons, before being sent to the Golden State Warrior in the mid-way of last season. But before the trade, he averaged a career high of 7.6 assists per game as the Lakers’ starting point guard.

The 34-year-old point guard will be returning back to his old home—Portland. Then now playing as the backup guard for rising star Damian Lillard, he will give the team a much needed veteran presence that can consistently contribute and provide a good boost off the bench.

Throughout Blake’s 11-year career, he has averaged 6.9 points and 4.0 assists a game.
