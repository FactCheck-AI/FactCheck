Former Blue Devils have won NBA rings: Jeff Mullins, Danny Ferry, Shane Battier, Kyrie Irving, Dahntay Jones and Quinn Cook.

Prior to Sunday’s Game 6 win by the Los Angeles Lakers, only one of them had won an NCAA title and two championships - Shane Battier, with Miami in 2012 and 2013.

Well now there are two who can say that as Cook picked up his second ring in three years. The first was with Golden State.

The great thing about Cook is that he didn’t have an easy path to the league but he just kept working and finally found a way in and now look at him, matching Battier’s accomplishments.

At Duke, remember, he was the senior willing to let Tre Jones run the team. He’s always been a team-first guy and we could not be happier for him or prouder of him. There is no better teammate in the NBA than Quinn Cook and his success is absolutely deserved.

Cook also has something in common with Battier, Jones and Irving: all helped LeBron James win championships. In fact, he’s never won a title without a member of the Brotherhood.
