About this grant

This grant will enable NPower Michigan to expand and improve services by leveraging partnerships with other organizations. In 2006, NPower Michigan and the Michigan Nonprofit Association will begin sharing office space in Detroit, merge together a membership base of 850 nonprofits and jointly distribute a monthly newsletter. In addition, promising collaborative ventures have been established with New Horizons (basic computer training), Microsoft, PMV Tech, Accenture and NuSoft Solutions. Nonprofits in Michigan will benefit by receiving private sector technology expertise guided by NPower consultants familiar with the mission-driven focus and context of the nonprofit sector.
