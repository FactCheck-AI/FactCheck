Application Work Integration

Oracle Universal Work Queue acts as an integration framework for work item delivery (screen pops) to applications. It provides the media plug-in and application work provider frameworks described above to incorporate media and work items. It also provides an application integration infrastructure that allows applications to receive screen pops through Oracle Universal Work Queue from media and application work providers. Only Oracle Forms-based applications integrate with Oracle Universal Work Queue and they integrate at the forms level. Not all Forms applications integrate with Oracle Universal Work Queue. Only some application forms support Oracle Universal Work Queue screen pops.

An application work provider creates and manages one or more work item types. Not all Oracle E-Business applications use Universal Work Queue for the presentation and delivery of work items.

The following applications support Oracle Universal Work Queue screen pops:

Oracle TeleSales

Oracle TeleService

Oracle Advanced Collections

Oracle Task Manager

Oracle Escalation Manager

Application Work Nodes

Application work providers expose work item lists through Universal Work Queue nodes.

Nodes organize work by work type (task, service request, media), ownership or assignment and by distribution (groups or individuals).

There may be more than one node for a given work object type: “My Leads” and “My Teams Leads”

Nodes may include sub-nodes that further segment work by work item type.

Nodes display summary information about each work item the agent may access.

Nodes may include quick filters to refine summary information displayed.

Nodes may include quick actions (Workpanel) to allow agents to act upon one or several selected work items.

Agents may open work from the work summary; UWQ launches work into the appropriate application form based on work object action mapping implemented in this release.

Summary information presented is different for each work object type.

Sites customize nodes.

Sites customize summary display. Each summary display consists of a spread table; sites may configure the order and visibility of columns in the spread table.

Sites may set default sort order for summary display.

Sites may set order of nodes within Agent Workplace.

Sites may grant or deny access to nodes on a site-wide, responsibility and individual agent basis.

Sites may control access to Workpanel on a site-wide, responsibility and individual agent basis.

Sites may configure Workpanel commands, parameter display and notes on a responsibility basis through an HTML administration tool.

Sites may configure Quick Filters for each node on a responsibility basis through an HTML administration tool.

Allow agents to control node displays.

Agents may customize the work selector.

Agents may dynamically change node access method: tree control or cascading control.

Agents may hide (or display) nodes for a single session.

Agents may change node order for a single session.

Agents may customize node summary display and save setting between sessions:

Agents may change and save sort summary sort order.

Agents may hide or display summary columns.

Agents may change the order of summary columns.

Queued, Priority Work Distribution and Delivery

Work providers may include work items in the Work Repository to support queued, prioritized distribution and delivery of work items.

Applications map work item priority to UWQ global priority.

Applications maintain work item status.

Applications define work sources and work distribution methods and rules.

UWQ queues work items and supports distribution only upon request and focused, next work distribution and delivery.

Application Notices

Oracle E-Business applications provide notice of important events through Universal Work Queue's application notice framework.

Individual applications may directly integrate with the Application Notice facility or they may supply workflows that send application notices upon specific events.

The work provider (application or workflow) determines the actual events that trigger an application notice.

Sites may create application notices through public APIs.

Agents may launch work item directly from notice.

Tasks

Tasks integrate with UWQ for application work. Tasks provide two nodes for browse and select work, “My Tasks” and “Enterprise Tasks,” “All Tasks” is no longer supported.

Tasks integrate with the Work Repository to support primary and relationship work sources. This means tasks may be distributed with independent rules for stand-alone tasks (such as agent appointments) or as dependent (child) work items based on the task source application.

Using the new work action associations in this release, sites may determine the task launch form based on user responsibility and task source document. This means that a service request task may be configured to launch the task manager, service request form or contact center depending on an agent's responsibility.

Oracle TeleSales supports a “Personal Lists” node driven off the Universal Search. This node supports contacts (like Marketing Lists) and Opportunities. Agents create personal lists by specifying selection criteria and executing a Universal Search, then categorizing it as either a Contact or an Opportunity. Agents may create a number of lists in each category. They may be used to track “hot” or failing opportunities, work that requires near-term follow-up, etc. For contacts it is a useful means of creating lists for recurring activities, such as a quarterly or monthly phone call. Personal Lists support Workpanel actions. Contact type lists support Marketing List actions, Opportunity type lists support Opportunity actions. Personal Lists also include the recent activity column and filter.

Collections

Collections applications support four major work objects:

Delinquency – the debt that needs to be collected

Broken Promises – a failed promise to pay in response to a collection effort.

Strategies – a collection effort on behalf of a delinquency.

Dunning – an attempt to collect a delinquency, generally in the form of a letter.

To assist collectors, Collections provides a number of nodes organized to view customer or account information. (See the node list below.) Collections does not support Workpanel, Quick Filters or Work Repository for any of these work item objects.

Service Requests

The service request node supports end-user customization through service provided utilities. This allows site administrators to set the segmentation of the service node. Service supports the new work repository for work distribution from service request and SR Task work sources. It does not support Workpanel or Quick Filters.

Universal Work Queue also supports the following for service requests:

Work Distribution

SR Tasks distributed only after related service request has been distributed

Distribute Only mode

Distribute and Deliver framework

Media Channel Integration

Media work providers integrate through the UWQ media plug-in, a de-coupled, real-time media interface. Universal Work Queue provides media support for the following media providers.

Advanced Inbound Telephony

The following integration support is provided for Oracle Advanced Inbound Telephony:

Active and passive mode OTM screen pops.

Active mode, OTM classifies a call and routes it to and queues it for a specific agent or agent group.

Passive mode, an ACD routes and queues the call, OTM provides only CTI services to pass call classifications, events and information through UWQ to the agent's softphone and application.

Execute screen pop based on AI classification and Universal work Queue application action mapping.

Direct and route point call transfers between agents with different responsibilities.

Direct inbound call screen pop configuration: call received, on agent answer or on agent answer and end interaction.

Note: Always use the softphone when it is present. Never use your physical telephone unless directed to by either a warning message or your supervisor.

Advanced Outbound

Universal Work Queue exposes Advanced Outbound campaigns and facilitates call delivery in:

Predictive mode - voice and application screen pop delivered to agent simultaneously

Progressive - Universal Work Queue coordinates dial when application work item is delivered from Advanced Outbound

Preview - Universal Work Queue inserts phone number into the softphone when work is received from Advanced Outbound; agent dials call when ready.

Time Preview - same as preview mode, except automatically places call if agent does not dial within a set time.

AO manual mode - no CTI, only delivers application work item, agent dials phone manually.

Interaction Blending supports multi-list campaigns.

Web Callback

Universal Work Queue supports web callback as an alternate inbound channel. Self-service applications expose a 'call me' button on their web pages. Users request a callback by select the button and entering the callback information (name, phone number, and reason). Oracle Telephony Manager classifies and queues the callback request and distributes it to the next available agent in standard (FIFO) order, by classification.

Email Center

With this release, Universal Work Queue provides full support for email. Agents may access email accounts and classifications from within Universal Work Queue to request new email and access unfinished responses from their inbox. Both access methods launch the HTML Email client.

You can perform the following:

Request next email - Email Center queues are accessed through the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue

Open received email - Agents can access inbox from the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue

Interaction Blending Integration

Note: This procedure applies to the blending of media work. It is only required when implementing Oracle Interaction Blending. The System Administrator responsibility is required to define profile options.

Oracle Interaction Blending dynamically moves agents between queues and media types based on the service levels for the interaction center. Use the following procedure to integrate Universal Work Queue with Oracle Interaction Blending.

Set UWQ Profile Options for Oracle Interaction Blending

The IEU: Blending Style profile is used to enable the blending of media work. When an agent requests work from the Blended node, Universal Work Queue will deliver any of the media type for which an agent is enabled (e.g., inbound, web callbacks, or outbound), based on the service levels for the interaction center.

The following table features the four blending options:

Setting Description Full Forced Blended Enables the blending of media work.

A Blended node appears in the Universal Work Queue work selector.

The media node or nodes (e.g., Inbound and Outbound) from which an agent can request work that is specific to the media do not appear. Full Optional Blended Enables media work blending and the appearance of a Blended node and media nodes (e.g., Inbound or Outbound) in the Universal Work Queue window.

The media node or nodes (e.g., Inbound and Outbound) from which an agent can request work that is specific to the media also appears, allowing an agent to select between the nodes. Not Blended Media work blending is not enabled. A single blending node appears. Simple Forced Blended Provides the ability for passive blending. Simple Optional Blended Provides the ability for enhanced-passive blending. All media nodes appear.

Advanced Inbound Integration

Note: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle Advanced Inbound.

Universal Work Queue channels media requests, events and information to the softphone and Oracle E-Business applications. Agents use this channel to log into the Oracle Telephony Manager and assign their extension for receipt of inbound calls.

Oracle Advanced Inbound is an Interaction Center module which is comprised of the following Interaction Center products:

Oracle Telephony Manager

Universal Work Queue

Oracle Interaction Blending

Oracle Routing Server

Oracle Interactive Voice Response Integration

Together these products provide the base for managing customer interactions through multiple channels, delivering interactions to appropriate agents when ready.

Oracle Advanced Inbound is required to telephony enable business applications in the Oracle E-Business Suite. Telephony-enabled means that the product has the capability of communicating with a telephone system for both inbound and outbound calls via the Computer Telephony Integration (CTI) middleware that handles the messaging between a telephone switch and the user's application.

Oracle Advanced Inbound provides an enterprise with the means to improve interaction center productivity through CTI to it's PBX and IVR platforms for application screen pops in the Oracle Applications. It also ensures that the proper customer is routed to the correct agent for multi-media contacts.

The server architecture of Oracle Advanced Inbound is scalable to run interaction centers with a single physical site or multiple sites. It can also be configured to integrate IVR data. The integration points for Oracle Advanced Inbound to other Interaction Center Modules and products include Oracle Advanced Outbound, Universal Work Queue, and Oracle Interaction Blending.

Set UWQ Profile Options for Oracle Advanced Outbound

The following profile options need to be set for users in Universal Work Queue:

Profile Option Setting IEU: Queue: Advanced Outbound Telephony Yes IEU: Queue: Media: Telephony Yes

Email Center Integration

With this release, Universal Work Queue provides full support for email. Agents may access email accounts and classifications from within Universal Work Queue to request new email and access unfinished responses from their inbox. Both access methods launch the HTML Email client.

You can perform the following:

Request next email - Email Center queues are accessed through the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue

Open received email - Agents can access inbox from the agent workplace in Universal Work Queue

Prior to this release read-only views of email queues and an agent's inbox were displayed in the Universal Work Queue. An agent could view the number of emails in each individual classification queue and also view the list of all emails in their inbox. However they could not either acquire the next message from the queue or open an email from the inbox.

Queued Emails

The “Queued Emails” view provides a count for the number of e-mail messages queued for a specific account. This view displays only the e-mail accounts to which the agent has been assigned. The agent can also drill down to view the count of e-mail messages queued for each classification under a specific account. The agent can acquire the next -email message for a specific classification or the next -email message across all classifications for that account by double-clicking the appropriate row or by selecting the row and clicking the “Get Work” icon in the menu bar. E-mail messages are always delivered to the agent in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. The Email Center Message Component is launched in a separate browser window and the contents of the e-mail message along with suggested responses and matching customer data are displayed in the Reply screen. When the agent ends the interaction by responding to the e-mail message, transferring, rerouting, or deleting it, the Message Component window closes automatically. Because each e-mail message is recorded as a separate interaction, the agent can have more than one message open at the same time.

My Inbox

The “My Inbox” view displays the lists of e-mail messages in an agent's inbox. Agents can view e-mail across all accounts to which they are assigned or a list of e-mail messages for a specific account. The following details are displayed for each e-mail message in the agent's inbox:

Read/New – This column indicates whether the message has already been read by the agent or not. An e-mail message could get placed in the agent's inbox if it was automatically routed to the agent, transferred by another agent or assigned by a supervisor. The e-mail message is marked as “New” until the agent views it.

Account – The account name to which the e-mail message belongs is only displayed in a summary view of ALL e-mail ,essagess in the agent's inbox. This column is not displayed when the agent drills down to a specific e-mail account.

Classification – The predefined group into which the e-mail is classified.

From – Sender's -email address

Subject – E-mail message subject

Date – The date the e-mail message was received

Priority – While transferring an e-mail message to another agent, a “high” priority can be assigned to the email. Additionally, while transferring an e-mail message to a supervisor, an “Escalated” priority could be assigned as well. These priorities are displayed here for corresponding e-mail messagess.

Status – The current status of the e-mail message, which includes “Read”, “Transferred”, “Escalated”, “Auto Routed” or “Assigned” or “Saved”

The agent can open an e-mail message from the inbox by double-clicking the corresponding row in the view or selecting it and clicking the “Get Work” icon in the menu bar. The eMail Center Message component is launched in a separate browser window and the contents of the email along with suggested responses and matching customer data is displayed in the Reply screen. When the agent ends the interaction by either responding to the email, transferring, rerouting or deleting it, the Message Component window is automatically closed. The agent can have more than one e-mail message open at the same time because each one is recorded as a separate interaction.

Oracle Customer Care Integration

Note: This procedure is only required when implementing Oracle Customer Care.

The Oracle Customer Care application allows an organization to create profitable customer relationships by managing enterprise-wide customer interactions and information. This is accomplished from the Contact Center. The Contact Center provides a single interface for managing all customer transactions in an efficient. An agent can log a quick service request, search the knowledge base for solutions, assign tasks, and enter and view notes for a customer.

Customers can initiate media and non-media interactions with a company. Media interactions consist of inbound phone calls, emails, or web callbacks and non -media events may be items such as service requests or tasks. The agent can view the work items assigned, in Universal Work Queue. The agent selects the media or non-media work item to process in Universal Work Queue.

Integration with Oracle Telephony Manager through Universal Work Queue, facilitates the media interactions. Telephony Manager routes the call to the appropriate agent based upon availability. When the agent uses the softphone to accept the call, the Contact Center is populated with the customer information. The customer is identified based on the phone number, account number, or other call parameters that the caller enters in the Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR).

The function of a Contact Center with the integration of Oracle Telephony Manager through Universal Work Queue allow Oracle Customer Care to be interfaced with a telephone switch, which includes the added functionality of the softphone.

The integration of Universal Work Queue and Oracle Customer Care provide for the following features:

Softphone is enabled.

Telephone icon is highlighted.

Instant access to customer information with call inputs screen.

Message icon allows a message to be created and sent in Oracle Customer Care.

Task icon opens the task window, allowing the creation of a new task.
