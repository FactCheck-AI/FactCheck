What: The Benaki Museum celebrates the 60th anniversary of George Seferis winning the Nobel Prize for literature with a commemorative exhibition entitled “George Seferis: sixty years later.” The exhibition features artefacts and photographic documents, newspaper clippings, documentation of the award ceremony, press articles, letters and congratulatory telegrams, posters, newspapers, visual and audio documents displayed alongside the poet’s personal objects – all of which evoke the significance of the day in Greek modern history and an insight into the poet’s personality.
