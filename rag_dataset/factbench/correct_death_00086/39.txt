THE VERY REV. STR GEORGE ADAM SMITH died on March 3 at his residence, Sweethillocks, Balerno, Midlothian, in his eighty-sixth year. A native of Calcutta, he was son of George Smith, who had a high reputation not only as a journalist but also as a biographer of missionaries. The young George was brought to Edinburgh, where he was educated at the Royal High School and the University. His university period does not seem to have been marked by any special distinction in examinations, though I fancy he must have taken a high place in the English class, if we are to judge by his writings. But he made valuable friendships there with such men as Henry Drummond, R. W. Barbour, Thomas Shaw (afterwards Lord Craigmyle) and R. B. Haldane, the great philosopher and war minister. His attachment to Edinburgh remained deep to the last. As a member of the Free Church of Scotland, he naturally proceeded to New College for his divinity course, when he had decided on the ministry as his life's work.
