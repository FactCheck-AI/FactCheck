Superbad is arguably one of the best coming of age comedies of our time sporting stars like Jonah Hill, Emma Stone, and Seth Rogen. Somehow over 15 years have now passed since the movie’s premiere, and so much has happened to the stars.

Recently, social media has been buzzing with praise for Jonah Hill’s new Netflix documentary, Stutz, a film about his profound journey with his therapist. And let’s not forget Emma Stone’s thrilling performance in Cruella, which even earned her a sequel deal. Seth Rogen has also been making headlines with his comments about how no one has made a good high school movie since Superbad. Take a look at these throwback cast member photos from the Superbad premiere compared to images of them now.
