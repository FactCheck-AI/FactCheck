The Bush compound is the summer home of 41st President of the United States George H. W. Bush. It is located on Walker's Point (previously known as Point Vesuvius and home to a Kennebunkport city park called "Damon Park"). Walker's Point juts out into the Atlantic Ocean in southern Maine, in the town of Kennebunkport. The property has been a family retreat for more than a century.
