Former Creighton basketball stars Doug McDermott and Kyle Korver will make their return to Omaha in a preseason game. The Chicago Bulls will take on the Atlanta Hawks Thursday, Oct. 20th at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha.

Last season, McDermott hit the game winning shot during a preseason game at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln.

Korver played at Creighton from 1999-2003. He was a two time Missouri Valley Conference Player of the Year and two time first-team All-MVC. Korver was drafted in the second round by the New Jersey Nets in the 2003 NBA Draft.

McDermott played at Creighton from 2010-14. He racked up plenty of awards during his time with the Bluejays, including three-time consensus first-team All-American and the 2014 NCAA scoring champion. McDermott was drafted 11th overall by the Denver Nuggets in the 2014 NBA Draft, but was traded to the Bulls shortly after.
