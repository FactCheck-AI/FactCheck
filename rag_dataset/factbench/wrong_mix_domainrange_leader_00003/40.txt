The Minister Resident in Iraq (Knabenshue) to the Secretary of State

No. 1523

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the Departmentâ€™s instruction no. 409 of February 2, 1940, enclosing a draft consular convention and to report that on March 11, 1940, I personally presented the draft to His Excellency General Nuri as-Said, Prime Minister and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, together with my note to him dated March 8, 1940, a copy of which is enclosed herewith.40 In presenting the draft convention to His Excellency, I pointed out that there was nothing exceptional in the phraseology or provisions of the convention which would give cause for delay in its consideration, and I expressed the hope that his Government would give the matter early attention in order that the convention, which is mutually desirable might be brought into effect as soon as possible.

Respectfully yours,
