Winning two-thirds of the vote over his conservative challenger,

Stipe Mesic has secured a second five-year term in the presidential

office in Croatia.

The incumbent Stipe Mesic has won a convincing victory over

his challenger, Jadranka Kosor, in Croatiaâ€™s presidential

run-off vote held on 16 January. The independent Mesic

took 66 per cent of the vote leaving 34 per cent

for conservative Kosor of the Croatian Democratic

Union. Voter turnout was just above 50 per cent.

The people of Croatia appear to have rewarded the 70 year-old

Mesic, who first took office in 2000, with a second

five-year term for leading them out of international isolation

following the nationalistic rule of Franjo Tudjman.

Mesic is now likely to lead his country into the

European Union. Membership negotiations are due to begin

with Croatia in March 2005 provided that it continues to co-operate

with the international war crimes tribunal.
