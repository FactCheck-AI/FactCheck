Classy move by the Boston Celtics, as they pulled out a full-page ad in the Boston Globe honoring Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, who were traded this summer to the Brooklyn Nets. The ad pays tribute to the 2008 NBA championship victory: “The Celtics have offered a public thank you to Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett with a full-page ad in Friday’s Boston Globe sports section. Pierce and Garnett were traded to the Brooklyn Nets in late June. The Celtics also shared the message via social media, tweeting ‘You will always be Celtics.'”
