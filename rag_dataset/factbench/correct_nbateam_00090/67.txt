Former Warriors center Andris Biedrins seems to be enjoying life in his post NBA career.

The native of Riga, Latvia, joined Andrei Kirilenko and members of the Latvia national team to judge the Ghetto Kings of Air dunk contest Tuesday in Latvia. And Biedrins, now 31 years old, is sporting a new look.

As he was escorted into the arena, the 7-footer showed off a fully tattooed, jacked-up left arm.

The Warriors selected Biedrins with the 11th overall pick in the 2004 NBA Draft and he never quite lived up to the hype. In nine seasons with Golden State, Biedrins averaged 6.4 points, 7.1 rebounds and 1.1 blocks per game.
