Golden State Warriors centre Andris Biedrins may have the worst stroke from the free throw line in the NBA.

Dwight Howard is improving and even Shaquille O’Neal could perform in the clutch when he put his mind to it. Biedrins however, is known for his high percentage of air balls to go along with his low percentage of free throw makes. Over his career, Biedrins is a 50.5 per cent shooter from the line but his recent form has proven to be such a liability that he has only attempted 15 free throws over the last two seasons, with only three makes.

On Friday against the Los Angeles Lakers, Biedrins was at his very worst, putting up one of the most horrific air balls you’ll ever see.

Well the next night, Warriors fans gave the big Latvian some love when he hit the first of two shots from the charity strike. Looking a bit relieved, Biedrins stepped up and sunk the second shot, rousing the Golden State faithful to their feet to give the struggling big man a standing ovation.

Injuries and confidence issues have plagued Biedrins since averaging 11.7 points and 11.2 rebounds back in 2008-09. The Warriors traded for Andrew Bogut at the trade deadline last year to be their anchor in the middle while Biedrins has been slowly fazed out of the rotation.
