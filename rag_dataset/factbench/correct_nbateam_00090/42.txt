East Rutherford, NJ (Sports Network) - Andris Biedrins and Stephen Jackson each scored a team-high 23 points, as the Golden State Warriors held off New Jersey for a 105-97 win in the Nets' home opener.

Biedrins also had 11 rebounds, while Jackson added eight assists for the Warriors, who got their first win of the season after losing the previous two by a combined nine points.

Corey Maggette contributed 20 points and 10 boards in the win for the Warriors, while Al Harrington had 14 points.

Josh Boone's 17 points and 14 rebounds led the Nets, who won their season- opener against the Wizards on Wednesday. Vince Carter posted 20 points in the loss for the Nets.

The teams traded baskets in the first quarter, but a Ryan Anderson layup put the Nets ahead, 25-24, after the stanza. The pattern continued until halftime, as an Anderson jumper brought New Jersey within 52-51.

Golden State, though, managed to pull away on the strength of an 11-2 run. Brook Lopez's hook shot pulled the Nets within 68-63 with 5:54 left, but Jackson followed with a three-pointer that triggered the Warriors' surge.

Jackson propelled the run almost by himself as, after a single Harrington free throw, he had a basket, three-pointer and dunk to put Golden State ahead 79-63 with 1:55 remaining in the third.

The Warriors held the lead for the rest of the quarter, as a Maggette free throw made it 85-69 going into the fourth, and for the majority of the stanza their advantage was in double digits.

But after Jackson's two free throws with 4:16 left gave Golden State a 99-85 lead, the Nets ripped off a 10-1 run.

Boone had three buckets in the surge, including one that brought the Nets within 100-95 with 43.2 seconds remaining. But a foul sent Maggette to the line for a pair, and he made both.

Devin Harris then lost a critical possession for New Jersey, which was forced to foul, and Golden State made enough free throws down the stretch to hold on for the win.
