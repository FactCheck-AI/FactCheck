About Venus Williams

Venus Williams, in full Venus Ebony Starr Williams, (born June 17, 1980, Lynwood, California, U.S.), is an American tennis player who, along with her sister Serena, redefined the sport with her strength and superb athleticism.

Is Venus Williams Vegan?

After being diagnosed with the autoimmune disease Sj√∂gren's Syndrome, which causes joint pain and fatigue, in 2011, Williams' future in tennis looked shaky. Transitioning to a vegan diet, however, was a game-changer.

Not only does a plant-based lifestyle allow Williams to manage her condition without medicine, she said, but it's improved the appearance of her skin, and research supports this.

"Plant-based definitely changed my life, it made my skin amazing," Williams told Insider, and she's not the only person to have experienced the complexion-boosting benefits of cutting out dairy and increasing fruit and veg consumption.
