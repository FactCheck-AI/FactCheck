Early Life

Ella Fitzgerald was born on April 25, 1917 in Newport News, Virginia to unmarried parents Temperance and William. Early the next decade, her mother began a relationship with a new partner, Portuguese immigrant Joseph da Silva, with whom she moved to Yonkers, New York. Through da Silva, Fitzgerald had a half-sister named Frances. Growing up, Fitzgerald performed exceptionally in the many primary schools she attended. With her Methodist family, she was also active in the Bethany African Methodist Episcopal Church. Fitzgerald later went to Benjamin Franklin High School.

When Fitzgerald was 15, her mother passed away from injuries incurred from an automobile accident. Subsequently, she was raised by her stepfather, and then with her aunt in Harlem. During this time, Fitzgerald began skipping school, and she got into increasing trouble. She worked as a lookout at a Mafia-affiliated bordello, and was placed in the Colored Orphan Asylum in the Bronx when the authorities discovered what she was doing. Fitzgerald was then moved to the New York Training School for Girls, a state reformatory institution in Hudson.

Career Breakthroughs

After a couple years singing on the streets of Harlem to make ends meet, Fitzgerald made a crucial appearance at Amateur Night at the Apollo Theater in 1934. For her renditions of the songs "Judy" and "The Object of My Affection," she won the first-place prize. The next year, Fitzgerald performed for a week at the Harlem Opera House with the Tiny Bradshaw band. A substantial success with both audiences and her fellow musical acts, she was invited to join the orchestra of bandleader Chick Webb. She subsequently achieved fame performing at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom, and recorded numerous hit songs including "Love and Kisses" and "(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It." In 1938, Fitzgerald earned her most widespread recognition yet when she released a version of the nursery rhyme "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," which became one of the best-selling records of the decade.

Following the passing of Webb in 1939, his band was renamed Ella and Her Famous Orchestra, led by Fitzgerald herself. With the group, she recorded close to 150 songs. Additionally, Fitzgerald recorded and performed with the Benny Goodman Orchestra, and had a side project called Ella Fitzgerald and Her Savoy Eight.
