The Cavs possess their mid-level exception worth about $2.65 million. They used the rest of their salary-cap space signing Bynum. There was some talk about bringing former Lakers forward Metta World Peace to the team. The Lakers used the amnesty provision on him and waived him. However, World Peace is not what the team needs. It might be a case of him being more of a bother than he’s worth. Coach Mike Brown and the former Ron Artest are close. His kids love him, too.

Before joining LA in ’09, World Peace’s preference was to become a Detroit Piston or go to Greece … “One of the only reasons I’m in L.A. is because of my agent,’ World Peace said. “He didn’t call Greece. I was so mad at him about that. “My first choice was Detroit. We called Joe Dumars and Joe Dumars said, ‘We can’t have it.’ I wanted to play in Detroit so bad … I wanted to do a lot of charity things … It was a bigger picture. If we did something like that (to get past the Malice at the Palace), people around the world would be like, ‘Wow.’ “So, I wanted to play in Detroit and Joe Dumars was like, ‘I don’t think it’s a good time for you to come to Detroit.’ “So, then my next option was Greece and then I was trying to play overseas, and then the Lakers called. Then I was like, ‘Cool, let’s do this. Let’s go to L.A.’ That’s how I became a Laker.”
