Former NBA forward Metta World Peace said Wednesday that the Malice at the Palace 10 years ago was the worst day in his life.

World Peace, then Ron Artest, stormed into the stands after a fan threw a beer on him during a game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons on Nov. 19, 2004. He punched a fan, and a brawl ensued with several players and fans scuffling in the stands.

He was suspended for the final 72 games of the regular season and all of the playoffs for his role in the brawl.

World Peace was the reigning defensive player of the year at the time of the brawl. The Pacers had opened the season 7-2 and were considered championship contenders after beating the Pistons. Suspensions to World Peace, Jermaine O'Neal and Stephen Jackson led to a disappointing season for Indiana.

World Peace is currently playing for the Sichuan Blue Whales in the Chinese Basketball Association. He won a championship with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 and also played for the Chicago Bulls, Sacramento Kings and New York Knicks during his 15-year NBA career.
