Former Boston Celtics player Rasheed Wallace has agreed to terms to join Darvin Ham’s coaching staff for the Los Angeles Lakers. This comes after his latest stint in college basketball with the Memphis Tigers and Penny Hardaway. Ham and Wallace were teammates on the 2004 Detroit Pistons NBA championship team.

Wallace had great skills as a player and brings his experience to the Lakers. His passion is what the Lakers need desperately right now after a moribund season. Celtics fans know his intensity first-hand, thanks to his time wearing the green and white. This seems like a great first step in righting the ship in LA.

Per Shams Charania:

Four-time NBA All-Star Rasheed Wallace has agreed on a deal to be an assistant coach for the Lakers under new head coach Darvin Ham. Both were teammates in Detroit and part of the 2004 title team.

Shams later notes Wallace “was recently identified as a candidate for Ham’s staff,” however, adding that the “two sides have not yet reached a formal contract stage.”
