Love Actually was a movie that the Tenth Doctor had a Blue-ray copy of in his TARDIS. He apparently emotionally binge-watched the film (among others) after losing Rose Tyler. (COMIC: A Rose by Any Other Name)

The film featured Hugh Grant dancing around 10 Downing Street. (PROSE: The Secret Diary of the Master)
