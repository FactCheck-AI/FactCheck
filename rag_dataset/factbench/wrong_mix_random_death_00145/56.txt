About Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library

Since launching in 1995, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library has become the preeminent early childhood book-gifting program in the world. The flagship program of The Dollywood Foundation, a 501©(3) non-profit organization, has gifted well over 182 million free books in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, and The Republic of Ireland. The Imagination Library mails more than 2 million high-quality, age-appropriate books each month to enrolled children from birth to age five. Dolly envisioned creating a lifelong love of reading, inspiring children to dream more, learn more, care more, and be more. The impact of the program has been widely researched and results suggest positive increases in key early childhood literacy metrics. Penguin Random House is the exclusive publisher for Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. For more information, please visit imaginationlibrary.com.

Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library is now available for Mount Pleasant residents!

The Mount Pleasant Public Library is pleased to announce the addition of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library to our suite of services, beginning December 2023. The addition of this service ensures the youngest of all library patrons, those birth-age 5, are able to build a home library of high-quality books, develop a love of reading at an early age, and begin kindergarten ready to read with positive book experiences.

This partnership and project would not be possible without community partners’ support. We would like to thank Don LeBlanc and The Mount Pleasant Public Library Foundation for supporting the project from its inception and allowing us to begin serving the community in this way. Donations toward the continued sponsorship of this program can be made at your local library, directly to The Mount Pleasant Public Library Foundation (307 E. Monroe St. Suite 101 Mount Pleasant, IA 52641).
