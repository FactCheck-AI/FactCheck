Mena Suvari has split from her husband Simone Sestito after just 18 months of marriage.

The 32-year-old actress filed for divorce in a Los Angeles court today, according to TMZ.

Suvari blames the split on 'irreconcilable differences,' according to court papers and asks that Sestito receive no spousal support.

The star, who shot to fame in 1999 Oscar-winning film American Beauty will also change her legal name from Mena Suvari-Sestito back to Mena Suvari.

She lists the date of their separation as November 2011, a mere 18 months after they tied the knot in a lavish wedding in Vatican City in June 2010, wearing a custom-designed Alice + Olivia gown.

Sestito, a concert promoter, and Mena married at Santo Stefano degli Abissini, an eight century church, and held their reception at Castello Odescalchi, a 15th-century castle in nearby Bracciano - where Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes also married.

The star told Us Weekly before she tied the knot with Sestito: 'I love him. He's Italian and my family is part Greek, and it's all about family and culture.'

Mena was previously married to cinematographer Robert Brinkman - they divorced back in 2005 after five years of marriage.

The actress will next appear in film American Reunion, the fourth instalment in the American Pie franchise, which is slated for release in April.
