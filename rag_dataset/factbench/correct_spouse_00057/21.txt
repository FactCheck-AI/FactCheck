After less than two years of marriage Mena and her concert promoter husband are set to divorce

After less than two years of marriage, Mena Suvari and her concert promoter husband are set to divorce.

Having said their vows less than 19 months ago, the American Beauty star has filed for divorce from her Italian-American husband Simone Sestito.

This will be Suvari’s second failed marriage, having split with her first husband Robert Brinkman in 2005.

Suvari met Sestito in 2007 at the Toronto International Film Festival and they began dating shortly after. The pair became engaged in June 2008 while holidaying in Jamaica and were married on 26 June 2010 in a private chapel in the famous Vatican City in Rome.

Suvari’s attorney, Mark Gross, filed divorce papers on her behalf on Friday in Los Angeles citing 'Irreconcilable differences' and asked that Sestito receive no spousal support.

Over the weekend the 32-year-old actress thanked fans for their support and wrote on Twitter: 'I love you all & am so grateful for all your love and support.'
