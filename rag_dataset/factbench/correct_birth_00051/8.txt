Yesterday, the world of music mourned the loss of true royalty. Aretha Franklin was an American singer, songwriter and pianist, but to millions of fans, she was an icon.

Aretha's Parents

Aretha and her father, C.L. Franklin

On March 25, 1942, Aretha Louise Franklin was born in Memphis, Tennessee. When Aretha was 2 years old, her family moved to Buffalo, New York, briefly for her father’s career as a minister. Before she turned 5, they made the permanent move to Detroit, Michigan, where Aretha remained until her death, yesterday, August 16, 2018.

Aretha’s father became her manager and she recorded her first album, “Songs of Faith”, in 1956, at the age of only 14!

Today’s Listening Example is Aretha’s Career-defining anthem, “RESPECT”. Recorded in February of 1967, “Respect” would reach No. 1 on the Billboard pop chart, win Franklin two Grammys and make her an international star. Thank you, Aretha, for sharing your talent, and the music in your soul, with all of us. You will be missed.
