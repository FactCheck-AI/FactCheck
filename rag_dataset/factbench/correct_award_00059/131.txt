The French poet, awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1960, spent many years in the United States during and after World War II. In 1958 he married the American Dorothy Milburn Russell. The name of the recipient is not given. Leger mentions his recent marriage, thanks his correspondent for help in preparing a translation of his latest book, and asks for help in getting it reviewed. The facsimile appears to be contemporary. The letter covers four sheets, written on recto only. Sheets are browned but not brittle. Left edge of first sheet is curled. A metal clip holding the sheets together has left a small stain on the verso of the last sheet. Overall in Very Good condition. Item #59-3841
