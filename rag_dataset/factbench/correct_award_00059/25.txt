Saint-John Perse was the pseudonym of a French poet named Alexis Leger. In 1960, Perse won the Nobel Prize in Literature “for the soaring flight and the evocative imagery of his poetry which in a visionary fashion reflects the conditions of our time.” He published “Et Vous, Mers / And You, Seas” in 1950 after moving to the United States.
