A member of Seton Hall's Sweet Sixteen team in 2000, Samuel Dalembert was a force on the court for the Pirates over his two seasons before being selected 26th overall in the first round of the 2001 NBA Draft. The 6'11" center enjoyed a standout freshman campaign, leading the BIG EAST with 3.9 blocks per game (in conference games only) and earning All-Metropolitan third team, BIG EAST All-Rookie and Seton Hall Freshman of the Year honors. He had a 12-rebound, six-block performance in Seton Hall's first-round NCAA Tournament win over Oregon. Dalembert ended his career as the program's all-time leader in blocks (167) and at the time of his induction was third in field goal percentage (.537) and blocks average (2.83). He went on to play 13 seasons in the NBA and ranks in the top 40 all-time in blocks.
