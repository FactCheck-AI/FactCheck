Candidate spouse Ann Romney will attend a fundraising lunch next week at the Bush home in Dallas, hosted by former first lady Laura Bush.

The ex-president himself will not be there.

"President Bush's schedule is full Tuesday and he will not be attending the women's luncheon," said a statement from his office. "But he's happy that Mrs. Bush is hosting Mrs. Romney at their home in Dallas."

President Obama attributes many of the nation's economic problems to the Bush administration.
