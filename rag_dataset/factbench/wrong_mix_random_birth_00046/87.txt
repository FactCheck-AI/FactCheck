Gov. Rick Perry is putting his months of attacks on Mitt Romney behind him and rallying to the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's banner.

The Texas Republican makes his first campaign trip on behalf of Romney on Friday when he visits Elk City, NV. He'll make two evening stops there Friday evening, with visits to the Silver State Stampede Rodeo and a Romney campaign office. Romney, who's a former Massachusetts governor, isn't expected to appear.

When Perry dropped out of the presidential campaign in January, he endorsed Newt Gingrich until he too dropped out. Despite harsh words between him and Romney during the primaries, however, Perry promised to support the Republican nominee and already has touted Romney in television appearances.

Nevada is a key state Obama won in 2008.
