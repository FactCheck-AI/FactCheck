There was a time when Martell Webster was one of the more dangerous streak shooters in the NBA. The sweet-shooting forward played 11 seasons with averages of 8.7 points and 3.1 rebounds while shooting 38% from long distance.

He played for three teams, namely the Portland Trail Blazers, Minnesota Timberwolves, and Washington Wizards.

Webster recently made buzz in his subreddit where he readily answered questions from everyone. One user asked about the chances of an NBA return and although the response was short, it still kept some promise.

“I may just be coming back right now. You Never know.”

For those who are doubting the capabilities of Martell Webster, watch the video below of his best streak while being a member of a then-promising Blazers team.

Webster last played in 2015 for the Wizards where he was used very sparingly due to injuries. He only averaged 11 minutes of playing time in 32 games that year.
