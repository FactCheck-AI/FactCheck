In their first meeting, the leaders of Japan and South Korea expressed mounting concern Saturday over North Korea's nuclear program and sought to overcome their nations' bitter historical differences.

Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, in the clearest such statement by a Japanese leader, apologized for the "unbearable sufferings" his nation inflicted on tens of thousands of Koreans during Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule.Hosokawa's apology was unlikely to be seen as adequate by Koreans, but President Kim Young-sam called it "satisfying."

"Now is the time to put the past behind us and move onward," Kim said. "Our two nations face a mountain of tasks that must be tackled jointly with the goal of advancing our common interests and world development in anticipation of the Asia-Pacific age."

Hosokawa took office in August and Kim in February.

The two leaders agreed that North Korea's suspected nuclear weapons development poses a serious security threat to the region and a grave challenge to the global nuclear nonproliferation pact, said South Korean chief presidential spokesman Lee Kyung-jae.

Hosakawa was particularly concerned about Communist North Korea's successful development of the ballistic Rodong missile, which has a range of 800 miles and puts all of South Korea and parts of Japan within its reach, Lee said.

The Japanese leader assured South Korea his nation would not develop ties with North Korea until nuclear concerns were resolved and both nations agreed to urge new efforts to settle the crisis through dialogue, the spokesman said.

Anti-Japanese protesters marched in three cities - Kyongju, Kwangju and Seoul - to protest Hosakawa's visit and improved ties with Japan. Protesters demand compensation for thousands of Koreans forced into labor or sexual servitude for Japanese wartime troops and details of those enslaved.
