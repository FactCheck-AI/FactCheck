Washington, D.C. – Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the following statement today on the passing of Baroness Margaret Thatcher, the first woman to serve as the United Kingdom’s Prime Minister:

“Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a commanding political figure, a leader of uncompromising strength, and a public servant who never failed to break down barriers. As the first woman—and longest-serving—British Prime Minister, she possessed a singular resilience that commanded the respect of her colleagues, the attention of a nation, and the awe of women and men across the world.

“She was a relentless force and a steady hand in our fight to win the Cold War, helping to bring down the Berlin Wall brick by brick. She led her country with poise, grace, and an unmistakable iron will that will forever stand as a true testament to her unwavering commitment to public service. We only hope it is a comfort to her daughter Carol, her son Mark, and the entire Thatcher family that so many share in their grief at this sad time.”
