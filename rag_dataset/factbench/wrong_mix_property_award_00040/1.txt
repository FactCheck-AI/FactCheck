1935

On October 1, 1935, Flexner's resignation became effective, and his successor, Herbert Spencer Gasser, took office. Under his direction, the study of proteins and their derivatives expanded until there were six laboratory groups working in this area. Gasser also encouraged more research in physical chemistry. In pathology and bacteriology, he favored the use of new methods oriented to basic medical biology.

A source of knowledge and intellectual stimulus for his colleagues, Gasser himself continued this study of nerve conduction, sharing a Nobel Prize in 1944 for his work in this area.
