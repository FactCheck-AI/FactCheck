Sad news from ONE TREE HILL star Bethany Joy Galeotti: The actress — whom GUIDING LIGHT viewers knew as Joie Lenz when she played Michelle Bauer Santos — announced on her blog yesterday that she and her husband, musician Michael Galeotti, are divorcing after six years of marriage. The couple has a one-year-old daughter, Maria; Michael is a member of the indie rock band Enation, along with Jonathan Jackson (ex-Lucky, GENERAL HOSPITAL).

“As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is because you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me “Bethany Joy Lenz” again. I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time.”
