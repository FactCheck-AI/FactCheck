Anatole France was a French poet, novelist and journalist. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921, at the age of 77, in recognition of his literary achievements.

I tried to locate the the work in which this quote appeared, but was unable to find it. And I thought absolutely everything was knowable on the interwebs! :)

Oh well.

This is still a beautiful quote. It's true, isn't it? The innocence of animals, their trusting and forgiving nature and their consistent ability to be unconditionally loving are one of the greatest gifts one can ever receive and can bring out the best in us. This includes the higher, "soulful" qualities of peace, joy, a connection to life and of course, love.

And..... speaking of animals and the soul! I would like to let you know about a wonderful project I am a part of. It is called The Animal Activist Art Book, and I am pleased to tell you that I am one of 80 remarkable artists from around the world who are contributing their art for a lovely coffee table style book. You can find out more about the artists and the book on the book's facebook page, which I hope you will visit, like and share!

Those of us who are part of it, are very proud of it!

Have a beautiful week!
