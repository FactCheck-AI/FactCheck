It might be an incredible coincidence, but if you leave the Washington Wizards, you might win the NBA championship.

A fact of the matter is that for the past eight seasons, a player from the D.C. based team has won the Larry Oâ€™ Brien trophy. Of course not with that team but with others.

This trend started back in 2017. Shaun Livingston and Javale McGee were a part of the legendary Golden State Warriors team that has won three titles in four years. Here is the list of all players.

Shaun Livingston (GSW 17, 18)

Javale McGee (GSW, 17,18)

Jodie Meeks (TOR, 19)

Dwight Howard (LAL 20)

Javale McGee (LAL, 20)

Markieff Morris (LAL, 20)

Bobby Portis (MIL, 21)

Gary Payton II (GSW, 22)

Otto Porter (GSW, 22)

Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (DEN, 23)

Jeff Green (DEN, 23)

Ish Smith (DEN, 23)
