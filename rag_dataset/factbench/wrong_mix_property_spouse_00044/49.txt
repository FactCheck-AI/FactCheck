Liz Hurley reportedly begs husband Arun Nayar to take her back following fling with Shane Warne

Elizabeth Hurley has reportedly begged husband Arun Nayar to take her back following her brief fling with cricketer and notorious ladies' man Shane Warne.

The 45-year-old model recently dumped the 41-year-old Australian sports star after discovering he'd sent over 100 sexually explicit text messages to other women while he was romancing her.

A married blonde model claimed Shane, who recently split from his wife but still lives with her and their three children in Melbourne, had bombarded her with raunchy messages, one of which read:

"Very very horny today thinking of you. I want to see you riding me."

And now it's being claimed that Liz attempted to salvage her three year marriage to the 46-year-old Indian tycoon, with a source telling the tabloid:

"Liz knows she's been a fool and has phoned Arun to say sorry and beg forgiveness. But Arun wants no part of it and is still going for quickie divorce."

But yesterday Arun was spotted outside exclusive eatery Scott's in Mayfair with a mystery brunette, with an eyewitness saying:

"They panicked at being snapped together. She dived into a taxi and he drove off."

After scandal of Liz's affair with Shane broke in the News Of The World, the mother-of-one Tweeted that she and Arun had been separated "months before", adding:

"Painful, sad days. Arun has been a great father to our son Damian & will always be in his life."
