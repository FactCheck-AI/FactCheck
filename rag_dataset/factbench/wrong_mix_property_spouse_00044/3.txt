Elizabeth Hurley's ex husband lost money after Uber-rival Karhoo collapsed following a scandal over lavish executive spending.

Wealthy textile heir Arun Nayar was a director in the London based start-up, which claimed to have thousands of customers but crashed into administration last month.

It later emerged that Daniel Ishag, its flamboyant founder and chief executive, had gone on a spending spree in the months before the firm's demise.

Nayar, who is worth a reported £161m, was an early investor, helping with the technology and becoming its third director.

He was among the investors who lost huge sums of money when it folded leaving debts of £30m.

Now it has emerged that the 52- year-old has widened his losses by dipping into his own pockets to compensate staff who were left unpaid.

One former employee, who asked not to be named, said: 'He is the only guy that comes out of this with any credit.

'When staff in London were told they wouldn't get paid, he was the only one who put his hand in his pocket to help people.'

It is understood Nayar was an old friend of Ishag, and was 'furious' at Ishag's spending, which included thousands on designer clothes and vet bills for his pet pug.
