Joseph Bosisto

Bosistoâs Eucalyptus oil was first distilled by Joseph Bosisto, a local Melbourne pharmacist. Bosisto who arrived in Adelaide, Australia in 1848, moved to Melbourne and started a pharmacy in Richmond in 1851. Encouraged by the famous Victorian Government Botanist Baron Ferdinand von Mueller (who became a friend of Bosisto for 50 years), Bosisto set up the first commercial eucalyptus oil distillery on the banks of the Dandenong Creek near Dandenong, Victoria. He soon set up other distilleries at Emerald, Menzies Creek and Macclesfield.

Bosistoâs Eucalyptus Oil

Bosisto was passionate about developing new Australian industries from native trees and plants. His âBosistoâs Eucalyptus Oilâ was sent to England in 1865, making it the first indigenous product exported from Australia.

Sales of Bosistoâs Eucalyptus Oil continued to increase with interest being fostered through international exhibitions.

Between 1854 and 1891 Bosistoâs Eucalyptus Oil was exhibited and awarded prizes in 17 international exhibitions including winning a gold medal at the London Annual International Exhibition in 1873.

Amalgamation

FGB amalgamates with other pharmaceutical companies to become Drug Houses of Australia (DHA). It was a dominant business for over 30 years however in 1968 it was taken over by a UK based corporate raider. Most of the properties were sold and then leased back in a typical asset stripping operation.

Acquisitions

Peter Abbott acquired DHA Manufacturing Pty Ltd. This included the eucalyptus oil operations as well as a product and brand portfolio consisting of Bosistoâs Eucalyptus Oil, Clements Tonic, Hypol Cod Liver Oil Emulsion, Kruses Fluid Magnesia, Bickfordâs Lime Juice Cordial and Bickford's Coffee Essence. The history of these products wasÂ impressiveÂ â Bosistoâs had been around since 1852, Kruseâs was first manufactured in 1868, Clements first recorded in a price list was in 1882 and Hypol and Kruses were registered as trade marks in 1906. With this acquisitionÂ an office and warehouse was set up in Moorabbin and in 1975 the company returned to its original name - Felton Grimwade & Bickford Pty Ltd.Â

Euky Bearubâ¢

Peter developed a eucalytpus chest rub, naming it âEuky Bearubâ and created the Euky Bear brand. The key ingredient was eucalyptus oil from the Companyâs farm operations in Inglewood. Peterâs passion was for an effective chest rub that children would enjoy using, that was also comforting and effective. The character Euky Bear was based on a lovable koala. The brand continued to grow and in 1989 the first Euky Bear vaporiser was launched, a patented Australian designed unit. Today, Euky Bear continues to be a favourite for generations of Australian families.Â

Glenalbyn Eucalyptus plantations

FGB embarked on a eucalyptus plantation project on company-owned land in Glenalbyn, located between Inglewood and Wedderburn in Victoria. The intention is to dramatically increase eucalyptus oil production in Australia. The species of tree used is the Blue Malle (E. polybractea, meaning multi-stemmed). It only grows naturally in two areas of Australia, Inglewood (Victoria) and West Wylong (NSW).Â It is the highest quality medicinal eucalyptus oil with the strongest fragrance and highest cineole content.Â A plantation of Blue Mallees is like a blue sea, waving in the breeze.Â
