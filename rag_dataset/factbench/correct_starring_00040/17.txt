Actor-director-producer Danny Glover (“Lethal Weapon,” “The Color Purple,” “Blindness,” “2012”) and Maya Rudolph (“Bridesmaids”) will star in Diego Luna’s English-language “Mr. Pig,” a road movie set in Mexico, which has just gone into production.

Written by Luna and Augusto Mendoza, his co-scribe on fiction debut “Abel,” “Mr. Pig” is set up at Canana, the Mexico City/L.A. production house Luna founded with Gael Garcia Bernal and Pablo Cruz and which has become a powerhouse producer for a new generation of Mexican helmers.

Mundial, the joint sales venture of Canana and IM Global, is handling international sales.

Boasting on paper some of the affectionate playful humor which made “Abel” Luna’s debut a hit, but a step up in scale and Luna’s second movie in English as a director, “Mr. Pig” turns on a farm-worker (Glover) who travels from the U.S. to Mexico, accompanied by a pig. They strike up a friendship of sorts.

Following on “Cesar Chavez,” also helmed by Luna, and a Pantelion release in the U.S. and Videocine release in Mexico, “Mr Pig” marks a further play by Canana, one of Mexico’s most international companies, for audiences in the U.S. and Mexico, as a movie’s home markets, and beyond in the rest of the world.

“’Mr. Pig’ is a beautiful road movie, and a chance to talk about love for Mexico through the eyes of an American,” said producer Pablo Cruz at Canana.

“It’s has a U.S. appeal because of Danny and its English-language. It’s obviously has a Mexican appeal because of Diego and other Mexican actors involved. And we’re looking to Mundial to take it into international markets,” Canana’s Pablo Cruz told Variety.
