Three more join Roland Emmerich's next

2012, Roland Emmerich's latest disaster epic, has grabbed itself three new cast members. Thandie Newton, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt have all joined the film about parallel universes, doppelgangers and a race to prevent a world-ending event that was predicted by the Mayans.

Glover is in line to play the president, with Newton as his daughter and Platt as his chief of staff (hey, nice promotion from The West Wing). John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor are already on board.

The film is set to start shooting next month, with a July 2009 release planned.
