'Revelatory. Harry Harrison's novel about Earth on the edge of disaster is both bracing and cathartic ... impressively prescient' Guardian

The planet's population has exploded and resources are stretched to breaking point. And, in a sweltering, overcrowded New York City of 35 million desperate inhabitants, a police detective must try to solve a murder. The basis of the cult film Soylent Green, this eerily prophetic novel is a nightmarish vision of a world in meltdown.

Harry Harrison

Harry Harrison (1925 - 2012) was born in Connecticut and lived in New York City until 1943, before being drafted into the United States military. After WW2, he settled in the United Kingdom.

His contribution to science fiction writing is almost unparalleled: Deathworld, the Stainless Steel Rat series, Bill, the Galactic Hero, Stars and Stripes Forever, and West of Eden are all classics of the genre. He received the Nebula Award, the Golden Scroll of the Academy of SF Film, Prix Jules Verne (Sweden) and the Premio Italia. He was also a member of the SF Hall of Fame.
