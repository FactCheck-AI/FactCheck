Shaun Livingston committed to Duke but opted to skip college and enter the league straight out of high school.

The then-18-year-old was selected fourth overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2004 NBA Draft and spent his 15-year career with various organizations.

Livingston played the final five seasons of his playing career with the Warriors and became a fan favorite during his stint in the Bay.

Following the 2018-19 season, and after winning three NBA championships with Golden State, Livingston announced his retirement from the league -- as a player, at least.

The following year, Livingston finalized a deal with the Warriors and was hired as a director of player affairs and engagement.

In the blink of an eye, Livingston went from a teenage rookie to the mentor of a pair of teenage rookies. And he’s enjoying every moment of it.

“It’s funny to hear that word because coming out at 18, we calling everybody OG,” Livingston said on Warriors Pregame Live on Wednesday. “And now to be in that role, I feel like guys like us are tailor-made for the young guys, for the rookies coming in and showing them how to be a pro. And for me, that’s been the most rewarding part of this job.”

If there are two players on the Dubs squad that can relate to Livingston, it’s 19-year-old rookies Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.

Hopefully the teenage rookie duo, along with the other young players, has been taking notes from the three-time NBA champion -- even more so as the squad tries to make it to their sixth NBA Finals in eight years.
