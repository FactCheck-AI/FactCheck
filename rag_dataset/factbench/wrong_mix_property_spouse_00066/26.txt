Chelsea Handler has finally confirmed her worst kept secret - she enjoyed a romance with rapper 50 Cent.

The 36-year-old opened up about her private life during an interview with Piers Morgan on CNN last night while promoting her new book, Lies That Chelsea Handler Told Me.

'We dated, very casually,' E! network TV host, who is now dating hotelier Andre Balazs, said.

'He's a very sweet, nice guy... I was sampling, kind of, the atmosphere, seeing what was out there, and I was satiated.'

She continued: 'He's a great guy... he's the complete antithesis of what you'd imagine. He's a sweetheart, he's great, he's funny, he has a great sense of humour.'

The pair refused to confirm they were dating each other last year, but she did regularly tease fans with pictures and comments that fuelled the rumours.

At one point, Handler tweeted: 'I don't know why anyone thinks I would ever date a rapper,' while posting a photo of the two in bed.

Handler is said to have dumped the rapper late last year and insiders claimed the he sent her gifts to win her back but Handler returned them with a note that said: 'I can buy my own gifts.'

When quizzed about those rumours by Morgan, Handler responded: 'I don’t like when men buy me ridiculous gifts and I don’t know them well, I can buy my own gifts.'

Handler was in a relationship with Ted Harbert, CEO of Comcast Entertainment, from 2006 to 2010 before dating Animal Planet star, Dave Salmoni in 2010.

Handler has been dating Balazs, who is Uma Thurman's ex, for four months.

But while it's over now, there's no animosity between the two. Even if she didn't like his gifts.
