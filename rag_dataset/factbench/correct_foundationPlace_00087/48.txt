Upcoming Initiatives

Under the banner of continued service improvement, we’re excited to announce plans for a cleaning service pilot program, exclusively for ABF Tenants. Currently, we’re seeking funding through grants and corporate sponsorships, and while these are not yet in place, our objective is to make this program permanent upon successful establishment. The launch date remains undecided as we await successful funding acquisition. If you’re keen to be part of this pilot initiative, we encourage you to reach out to the ABF office. Your participation could make a difference in this endeavor!
