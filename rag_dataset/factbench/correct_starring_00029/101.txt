De Tagle is in town to perform as front act for former Disney’s “Camp Rock” co-stars The Jonas Brothers’ concerts at Mall of Asia Arena in Manila on Friday, October 19, and at Waterfront Hotel & Casino in Cebu City on Saturday, October 20. Both De Tagle and The Jonas Brothers share the same manager, Kevin Jonas, Sr., the real-life dad of the Jonases.

De Tagle, who also starred in the hit television series “Hannah Montana,” and recently made her Broadway debut in the first Broadway revival of “Godspell,” last visited the Philippines 12 years ago.
