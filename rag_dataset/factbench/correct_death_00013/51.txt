The Hermitage is a historical museum situated in Davidson County, Tennessee, United States. It is located 10 miles east of downtown Nashville. This 1,000-acre site was owned by Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, from 1804 until his death at the Hermitage in 1845. The museum offers a unique opportunity to explore the life and times of one of America's most influential presidents.

The First Hermitage and the Log Cabin

The Hermitage is built in a secluded meadow that was chosen as a house site by Rachel Jackson, wife of Andrew Jackson. From 1804 to 1821, Jackson and his wife lived in a log cabin. Together, the complex formed the First Hermitage, with the structures known as the West, East, and Southeast cabins. Visitors can explore these historical structures and gain insight into the early life of the Jackson family.

The Formal Garden

To the east of the house, visitors will find a 1-acre formal garden designed by Philadelphia-based gardener William Frost in 1819. The garden is laid out in the English four-square kitchen garden style, consisting of four quadrants and a circular center bedroom contained by unusually long beveled bricks and pebbled pathways. This garden offers a peaceful retreat and a glimpse into the past.
