Computer Laboratory spin out XenSource to be acquired by Citrix Systems for $500million

XenSource, the leading provider of enterprise-class virtual infrastructure solutions built on the open source Xen® hypervisor, is to be acquired by Citrix Systems, the global leader in application delivery infrastructure, for approximately $500million in a combination of cash and stock.

XenSource was co-founded by Dr Ian Pratt, a Senior Lecturer at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory, and Simon Crosby who holds a PhD from the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

“The announcement represents a key milestone for the Xen project,” said Dr Ian Pratt, Chief Technical Architect at XenSource. “Citrix is committed to our community and the principles of transparency and neutrality that allow us to work together on the reference standard for virtualisation, promoting the rapid, ubiquitous adoption of virtualisation.”
