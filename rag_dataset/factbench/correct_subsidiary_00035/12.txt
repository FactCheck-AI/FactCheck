Six months after acquiring open source virtualization vendor XenSource for $500 million, Citrix is living up to its Open Source promises.

A new version of the commercial XenServer product is set to roll out the door and, true to its word, Citrix is continuing to embrace XenSource’s open source roots, the Xen project itself.

When the acquisition was first announced there was some discussion regarding Citrix’s open source intentions and how they might affect the open source Xen project.

It turns out that Citrix’s open source overtures weren’t false promises.
