Hi All,

we are planning to purchase NTP server Stratum 1 for collaboration servers . I have checked two brands whom provide NTP service

please can anyone recommend which one is the best

SecureSync / Orolia or Sonoma D12 / EndRun

A lot of people are successfully using a Raspberry Pi as a Stratum 1 NTP server. Granted, this solution isn't enterprise grade, and can't handle a huge load (it can probably handle a couple of hundred clients), but for about $50-60 US dollars, its hard to beat.

Microsemi and Meinberg also make enterprise-grade stratum-1 NTP servers. But, those run $2-3000 all the way up to about $20K.
