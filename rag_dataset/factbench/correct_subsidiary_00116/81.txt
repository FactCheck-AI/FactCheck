Enabling the era of next generation SDN

Stratum™ is an open source silicon-independent switch operating system for software defined networks. It is building an open, minimal production-ready distribution for white box switches. Stratum exposes a set of next-generation SDN interfaces including P4Runtime and OpenConfig, enabling interchangeability of forwarding devices and programmability of forwarding behaviors.

Stratum avoids the vendor lock-in of today’s data planes (i.e. proprietary silicon interfaces and closed software APIs) and enables easy integration of devices into operator networks. It delivers a complete white box switch solution to realize the ‘software defined’ promise of SDN.
