The Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Hans Grundberg, held meetings with senior American officials in Washington DC today to discuss recent developments and explore ways to facilitate progress towards resuming an inclusive Yemeni-led political process under UN auspices and a lasting resolution of the conflict.

Grundberg met with Richard R. Verma, the Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources, Ambassador Michele J. Sison, Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, Brett McGurk, the National Security Council Coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa, Tim Tim Lenderking, the U.S. Special Envoy for Yemen, and Daniel Shapiro, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense.

During the meetings, Grundberg reiterated the Secretary-Generalâ€™s calls for de-escalation in the region and the Red Sea and stressed the need to safeguard the progress made on peace mediation efforts in Yemen. In particular, the Special Envoy emphasized the paramount importance of sustaining regional and international concerted support to the parties to finalise a UN roadmap that operationalises their commitments to a nationwide ceasefire, measures to improve living conditions in Yemen, and the resumption of a political process to reach an inclusive and sustainable settlement of the conflict.
