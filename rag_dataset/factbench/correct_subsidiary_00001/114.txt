Consumer fraud class action filed on behalf of all persons nationwide who used the Alexa browsing software. The Complaint alleged that the Alexa browsing software goes beyond the mere tracking of usage paths that Alexa discloses to unlawfully intercept and access the personal confidential information of the user without his/her knowledge or consent in violation of federal law.

One of the first internet privacy litigation settlements. Under the settlement, Alexa, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com, will, among other things, destroy personally identifiable information it may have obtained from class members and will ensure that it does not obtain such information in the future without consent from its users. Class members may individually be entitled to up to $40 if Alexa's database, in the past, contained personally identifiable information about them.
