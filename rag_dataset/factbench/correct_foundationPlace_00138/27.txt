Seva Foundation is our sister organization based in Berkeley, California. Founded in 1978, Seva Foundation is a U.S.-based charitable organization.

Seva Canada and Seva Foundation are separate and distinct organizations that raise funds in our respective countries to pursue our common mission of ending avoidable blindness. Together, we manage our three country offices in Tibet, Nepal and Cambodia, and collaboratively work with our network of international partners to deliver life-changing eye care in developing countries around the world.
