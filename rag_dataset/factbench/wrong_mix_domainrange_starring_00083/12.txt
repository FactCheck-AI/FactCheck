What a GIFT.

High School Musical's most iconic duo, Sharpay and Ryan, reunited to give us the gift we all truly deserve: An acoustic version of "What I've Been Looking For".

We all know Sharpay and Ryan's original, boppier version kicked ass, but they slowed it down for us, Troy and Gabriella style, and it sounded so damn good.

We also learned that Ashley and Lucas didn't actually get along when they first started filming High School Musical.

But Ashley hailed Lucas "the best singer out of all of us", saying he could hit "any note".

Like they say, once a Wildcat, always a Wildcat.
