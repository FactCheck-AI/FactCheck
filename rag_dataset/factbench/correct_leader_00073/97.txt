Widow of the First Prime Minister, Tenth Governor General

Born June 26, 1932 in Long Bay Cays, South Andros, Lady Marguerite Pindling has represented the Bahamas with dignity and class both at home and abroad.

Despite the loss of her husband, the late Sir Lynden Pindling, Lady Pindling has become a Bahamian icon in her own right, securing her place in Bahamian history.

Lady Pindling first arrived in Nassau in 1946, where she lived with her sister, Louise, and attended the Western Senior School. After graduating, Lady Pindling’s first job was with well-known photographer Stanley Toogood. While working for Colyn Rees, the young Marguerite was introduced to a London-trained lawyer named Lynden Pindling.

Following a year-long courtship, they were wed on May 5, 1956. Shortly after their nuptials, Sir Lynden was elected to the House of Assembly and, in 1967, he was elected Prime Minister, a title he held until 1992.

During Sir Lynden’s tenure as Prime Minister, Lady Pindling devoted her time to charitable work, raising her four children, and supporting her husband.

In 2007, Lady Pindling was honoured by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and named a Dame Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George.

From 2014-2019, she served as 10th governor-general of the Bahamas.

Though she has become a Bahamian icon, she often refers to herself as ‘just a barefoot girl from Andros’.
