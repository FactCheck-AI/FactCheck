Dennis Quaid, seen above channeling his inner Randy Quaid in Deon Taylor’s The Intruder, will play a madman once more in the upcoming Paramount+ series “Happy Face.”

Variety reports this morning that Quaid will play the real-life serial killer known as “Happy Face” in the upcoming series, which also stars Annaleigh Ashford (“American Crime Story”).

The website details, “The series is inspired by the podcast of the same name from iHeartMedia and Melissa Moore, the book “Shattered Silence” written by Moore with M. Bridget Cook, and Moore’s true-life story.”

Here’s the official plot synopsis for the show: “Happy Face (Quaid) is an incarcerated serial killer who also is Melissa’s (Ashford) once-beloved father. After decades of no contact, he finally finds a way to force himself back into his daughter’s life. In a race against the clock, Melissa must find out if an innocent man is going to be put to death for a crime her father committed.

“Throughout, she discovers the impact her father had on his victims’ families and must face a reckoning of her own identity.”
