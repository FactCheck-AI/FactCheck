Background

Considered one of the greatest guitarists of all time by “Rolling Stone” magazine, Willie Hugh Nelson was born on April 29, 1933, in Abbott, Texas. After his father died and his mother left, Nelson and his sister, Roberta Nelson, were raised by their grandparents. The country icon began writing songs at the age of seven, and while still in high school, he went on his first tour as the lead vocalist and guitarist for Bohemian Polka. Nelson entered the United States Air Force shortly after graduating but was released owing to back difficulties. When he returned, he attended Baylor University for two years before dropping out because he was becoming successful in music.

After Nelson relocated to Nashville in 1960 and found work as a songwriter there, some of his songs, particularly ‘Crazy,’ which Patsy Cline covered, and ‘Night Life,’ which Ray Price sang, became country standards. However, his albums were a failure despite his successful songwriting career. Disillusioned, Nelson decided to buy a farm outside of Nashville and embark on a career as a farmer-songwriter. After the fire that destroyed his Tennessee home in 1970, Nelson decided to go to Austin, where he became a part of the outlaw country music scene. In the following few years, he would host the well-known Fourth of July picnic, and his recordings, especially “Red Headed Stranger” and “Stardust,” would help establish the beginning of a tremendous legacy.

Nelson has almost 350 songs and 100 albums under his belt, as well as roles in 30 movies, novels, and agitation for the use of biofuels and marijuana legalization. He still performs on tour regularly today, working with musicians like Dolly Parton and Snoop Dogg while continuing to play the Martin N-20 classical guitar he has used since 1969.
