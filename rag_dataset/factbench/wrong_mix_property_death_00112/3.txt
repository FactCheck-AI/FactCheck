Lincoln House, 113 Brattle Street, Cambridge, MA, is next door to Longfellow National Historic Site, or Longellow House. It was built in 1887 for Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's daughter Edith and her husband, Richard Henry Dana.

It now is home to the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a foundation that has financed some of my research over the past dozen years or so; meetings there have enabled me to visit the area periodically, including the early part of this week. The Lincoln Institute acquired the house in 1989 and undertook restoration. The house has been repainted in its original colors, and the front parlors have been decorated with period-correct wallpapers and furnishings.

Lincoln House is part of Old Cambridge Historic District, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 (83000821); also in the historic district are Longfellow House, at 105 Brattle Street, and Episcopal Divinity School, 105 Brattle Street -- photos of each are part of my New England album.
