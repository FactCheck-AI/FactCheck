The Jesus Incident by Frank Herbert & Bill Ransom [THE PANDORA SEQUENCE #1]

VINTAGE PAPERBACK [1982] BERKLEY BOOKS

7th paperback printing. Solid vintage reading copy with some heavy wear to cover and tanning to pages.

A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable. But they have more to deal with than just murderous aliens: their ship's computer has been given artificial consciousness and has decided that it is a God. Now it is insisting—with all the not inconsiderable force of its impressive array of armaments to back it up—that the colonists find appropriate ways to worship It.
