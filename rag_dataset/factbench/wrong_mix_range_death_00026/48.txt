The 25th President of the United States, William McKinley, was assassinated on September 6, 1901, inside the Temple of Music on the grounds of the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York.

McKinley was shaking hands with the people when he was shot by Leon Czolgosz, an anarchist. The President died on September 14 from his bullet wounds in Buffalo, New York, aged 58. It was later known that Czolgosz killed the president to try to advance anarchism.

Not less than two months later Czolgosz was executed on October 29, 1901. Vice President Theodore Roosevelt became America's 26th President of the United States of America.
