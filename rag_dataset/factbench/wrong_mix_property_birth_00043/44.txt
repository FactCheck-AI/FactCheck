CAMARILLO, California, June 26, 2024 - kidSTREAM Children’s Museum is thrilled to announce a generous $100,000 donation from Alfred E. Mann Charities, Inc. This significant contribution supports kidSTREAM’s mission to create a world-class children’s museum in Ventura County, providing hands-on STREAM (Science, Technology, Reading, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) learning experiences for over 200,000 children in the region.

Michael Dreyer, President of Alfred E. Mann Charities, expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating, "It is well established that by fostering intellectual curiosity for a young child, that pursuit will continue on as children advance in age and become adults. We have observed how other children’s museums have done such a good job in having a fun place for children to play, but also a place to learn and to spark their interest. We are confident that kidSTREAM will be such an environment, and will be a great spot for children who live in the Camarillo community and surrounding locales."

Michael Shanklin, Executive Director of kidSTREAM, shared his gratitude for the donation, saying, "We are incredibly grateful to Alfred E. Mann Charities for their generous support. This donation brings us one step closer to opening our doors and providing the children of Ventura County with a space where they can explore, learn, and grow. Their belief in our vision is truly inspiring, and we are excited to continue making progress towards our goal."

Bryan Yee, Board Chair at kidSTREAM, emphasized the importance of early childhood educational experiences. "Early childhood education has the power to change life trajectories. With the support of Alfred E. Mann Charities, we are moving closer to creating a space where every child can discover their potential and be invested in at an early age. This donation not only supports our immediate goals but also helps build a lasting legacy for the community."

The Alfred E. Mann Charities donation is a testament to the growing community support for kidSTREAM. This contribution follows recent progress, including the submission of plans to the city and the anticipation of construction permits. The momentum continues to build, with other recent major donations also propelling the project forward.

kidSTREAM is committed to bringing the full vision of the museum to life, ensuring that every child in Ventura County has access to engaging and educational experiences. With continued support from donors and the community, the dream of opening a children’s museum in Camarillo is becoming a reality.
