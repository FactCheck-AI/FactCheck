The Bryan Brothers are calling it a career.

Twins Bob and Mike Bryan, a historically great tennis doubles duo out of Camarillo and Rio Mesa High, retired from the sport just before the start of the U.S. Open.

“We just both feel it in our guts that it is the right moment,” Mike Bryan told the New York Times. “At this age it takes so much work to go out there and compete. We love playing still, but we don’t love getting our bodies ready to get out there. The recovery is tougher. We feel like we were competitive this year, last year, the year before. We want to go out right now where we still have some good tennis left.”

In 22 years on the pro circuit, the Bryan Brothers captured 16 Grand Slam titles and seized 119 tour titles together. They finished No. 1 among doubles tandems 10 times in their illustrious careers.

Mike and his family live in Camarillo; Bob and his family reside in Florida. They are 42 years old.

The Bryan Brothers captured their 119th and final title in February of this year at the Delray Beach Open.
