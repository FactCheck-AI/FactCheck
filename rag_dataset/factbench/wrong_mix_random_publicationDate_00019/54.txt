Thirty years after Nobel Prize winner Dario Fo performed his Mistero Buffo in New York, the immersive, political solo show returns Off-Broadway. Performed by Panos Vlahos, performances will take place at The Balcony Theater at West-Park Presbyterian Church on the Upper West Side.

Audiences will be led through the church to encounter Vlahos. The show is billed as “part performance, part intimate gaze” and will take place May 26-28 only.

Mistero Buffo blends comedy and satire to critique religion and politics. The production is presented by The Orpheus Foundation for Greek Music and Arts with direction by Lyto Triantafyllidou. It also features special guest Wolf CR.
