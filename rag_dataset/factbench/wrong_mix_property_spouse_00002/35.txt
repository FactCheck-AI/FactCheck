TomKat happened quickly. In spring 2005, Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were about to begin dating one another in a highly publicized romance, surprising fans and the media. But even more surprising was the speed at which their romance progressed. Within weeks of meeting, the two became engaged. Within less than a year, they were expecting a baby. Suri Cruise was born in 2006.

Scandals related to Cruise's erratic behavior plagued the union, and rumors swirled that Scientology was behind the pairing. Many also believed the relationship was a publicity stunt - both Cruise and Holmes had movies coming out during the beginning of their romance, the height of their very public courtship.
