Lee Ryan has become a father for the third time.

The Blue singer - who already has son Rayn, 12, with former fiancee Samantha Miller in 2008 and daughter Bluebell, 13, with ex-girlfriend Jessica Keevil - and his partner Verity Paris welcomed a baby girl into the world earlier this month, and the tot is doing well.

His spokesperson confirmed to Metro.co.uk: "Lee and Verity welcomed the arrival of their beautiful daughter earlier this month as they begin their new family life together in Spain. Both mother and baby are healthy."

The happy news was initially broken by Lee's bandmate Duncan James when he was asked about the possibility of the 'All Rise' group - which also includes Simon Webbe and Antony Costa - getting together again soon.

Speaking on 'Lorraine', Duncan said: "I think with the pandemic everything’s kind of changed and shifted which is kind of annoying. Lee [Ryan] lives in Spain, he’s just become a daddy again.

"So he’s got a little wee bubba and Simon has just become a father again so there’s like a baby Blue boom going on.’

Lee has previously admitted it took a long time for him and Sammi to co-parent properly but he's thankful he and his son now have a close relationship.

Speaking previously, Lee said: "I shouldn’t have lost the family life I had with my ex-fiancee, Sammi, and our little boy, Rayn.

“He’s ten now and we’re really close again. But I neglected the relationship so it’s only relatively recently that he’s been able to see functioning co-parenting, something my mum and dad never achieved.

“I don’t have any regrets about the mistakes I’ve made because they’ve shown me that something good can come out of something bad.”
