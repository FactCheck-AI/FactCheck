The couple, who welcomed a daughter, whose name they haven't publicly shared, in August last year, tied the knot in an intimate and romantic ceremony. Lee, 38, moved to Spain last year to start a family with Verity, 31, and the couple said I Do at a registry office in Gibraltar. Newlywed Lee told The Sun: 'I met someone finally who loves and supports me in everything I do. 'I've never been more calm and grounded and I have Verity to thank for that. I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life because of the wonderful family life I now have.' As well as his seven-month-old daughter with Verity, Lee is also dad to daughter Bluebell, 13, who he shares with ex Jessica Keevil, and son Rayn, 12, whose mother is his ex-fianc√©e, Samantha Miller. The couple moved to a beachfront apartment in the Costa del Sol in 2020 with the duo admitting that they now have a 'better quality of life' and 'new lease of life'.
