THE PROCESS

Launch

Resilient by Design launched in May 2017 with an open call to engineers, architects, designers, artists, dreamers, community members and students to come together and create teams of experts willing to tackle the challenge of building resilience to climate change. Of the 51 teams entered, 9 of the selected local and global Design Teams completed the Bay Area Challenge.

Collaborative Research Phase

(Fall of 2017) the teams explored the Bay Area, looking closely at places nominated by the community as especially vulnerable to the threats of sea level rise, severe storms, flooding, and earthquakes. This also included studying the intricacies of the Bay Area, from the effects of gentrification and regional transportation challenges, to the unique cultural histories of local communities.

Collaborative Design Phase

In January 2018, after each team presented 3-5 design opportunities, the RbD Research Advisory Committee assigned teams to specific locations. Over the next four months, the Design Teams developed their solutions for tackling sea level rise and creating resiliency, while working closely with community partners to ensure the concepts actually match community needs. This included collaborating with Y-PLAN, a youth engagement group that brings real life civic planning into the classroom, to draw student voices and youth perspectives into the design work.

Challenge Summit

Finally in May 2018, the Teams each revealed their innovative designs to an esteemed Jury who deliberated and made a case for how each design makes an important contribution, as part of a constellation of approaches.Each design concept was shared as part of a larger package of how communities can approach resiliency. The key considerations for assessing the strengths of the designs included:

emphasis on multi-stakeholder, multi-benefit problem-solving strategies

demonstration of feasibility from a technological and engineering perspective

recognition of the need for a regional strategy

focus on equitable and measurable community engagement

ability to integrate ideas into existing sea level rise action plans. We’ve come a long way since the initial “Resilient by Design: Bay Area Challenge", which concluded in 2018.

Funders

Many thanks to all the generous funders who supported this innovative design challenge: The Rockefeller Foundation, Bay Area Regional Collaborative, seedfund, Santa Clara Valley Water District, City and County of San Francisco, Metropolitan Transportation Commission, Marin Community Foundation, Resources Legacy Fund, and Coastal Conservancy.

WHAT’S NEXT?

The work is not done. The nine design proposals serve as a catalyst for the community work moving forward and set the Bay Area on a path to a more resilient future. Many are committed to turning these ideas—invested in and created by communities—into real-world models and solutions for other cities to implement. Several of the Proposals have advanced from concepts to engineered designs with local partners.
