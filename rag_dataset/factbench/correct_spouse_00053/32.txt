(WOIO) - It's official! Sandra Bullock is now divorced from her cheating' husband Jesse James.

The split was finalized Monday but the documents are sealed.

But they'll still be seeing each other. Reports say James is moving to Bullock's home town of Austin, Texas because he wants Sandra's relationship with his kids to continue.
