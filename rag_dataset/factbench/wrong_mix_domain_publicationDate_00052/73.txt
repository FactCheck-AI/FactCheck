Bestselling American author Jonathan Lethem explains why he returned to Brooklyn in his fiction after 20 years.

Jonathan Lethem is the author of 13 crime and science fiction novels and he grew up in Brooklyn, New York City, in the 1970s.

Brooklyn was the setting for two of his most famous novels â€“ Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. But after these books came out, he vowed not to return to this place in his fiction.

Like a prodigal son, however, he has returned and his latest book, Brooklyn Crime Novel (Atlantic), is unlike most crime novels as it has no central crime, victim or suspect. Instead, it uncovers life on the street while bigger forces of gentrification, race and class are at play.

Jonathan Lethem spoke to Sarah L'Estrange at the recent Adelaide Writers' Week.
