A TURN OF THE CENTURY RESPITE

Dwight David “Ike” Eisenhower, the 34th president of the United States, was born in the downstairs bedroom of his family’s rental house in the community of Denison. The tiny but charming wood-framed house now sits on several large residential blocks dedicated to Eisenhower Birthplace State Historic Site, a Texas Historical Commission state historic site.

Eisenhower, who rose to the rank of General during the Second World War, was instrumental in Germany’s surrender and after a run for the Presidency served two terms. The restored home is filled with hundreds of items relating to Eisenhower and his role in American and world history. Although the infant “Ike” spent a little over a year, his first, in the house before his family returned with him to Kansas, the site provides a convincing vision of pastoral, Red River Valley town life at the turn of the century. The grounds, home, and visitor center are all wheelchair-accessible.
