New York City has long been a magnet for musical giants — all of which means that you might well end up spending time in a home once occupied by a legend in their field. (Or, perhaps, be able to tell stories about the time a well-known experimental musician practiced in your living room.) And if Upper West Side life with a side of musical history sounds intriguing, you may well be intrigued to her that the building that legendary vocalist Billie Holiday called home until her 1959 death is for sale.

That news comes via 6sqft, in an article that has more details about the townhouse for sale. It’s located on West 87th Street, not far from Central Park. At the time that Holiday lived there, the building consisted of several apartments; now, all six stories of it are a single-family home.

As 6sqft’s article notes, the townhouse was last on the market in 2017, when it sold for over $9.4 million. Since then, the building was renovated extensively; the asking price for the home is now $13,995,000. For that money, a buyer will get 6,300 square feet of space, including a wine room and back garden.

The building’s primary suite is located on the third floor, and includes a soaking tub and spa shower. Add some musical history into the mix and you have an especially charming combination.
