Personal Factoids

He was a man of no religion or of all religion, he was quoted saying “I adopt each theory, myth, god, and demi-god, / I see that the old accounts, bibles, genealogies, are true, without exception.”

Everyone continues to debate his sexuality, homosexual or bisexual, we may never know. What we do know is that only someone who has experienced love and intimacy could write with such conviction.

Walt’s Legacy

He lived and wrote, that’s what made him one of America’s most influential poets. Leaves of Grass is his most known poetic work but a trail of poems, stories, and letters his readers continue to hold close. Walt Whitman, while in person was deemed quiet and kind, was in fact loud and ahead of his time with his written words.
