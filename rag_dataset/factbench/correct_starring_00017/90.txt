Romantics rejoice - the cast of Love Actually is reuniting for a short sequel to raise money for Comic Relief.

Red Nose Day Actually will be written by Richard Curtis and star Hugh Grant, Keira Knightley and Colin Firth.

Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Rowan Atkinson will also appear in the film, which sets out to discover what the original characters are doing in 2017.

The 10-minute sequel will be shown on 24 March on BBC One as part of the Red Nose Day appeal.

It comes 14 years after Love Actually was released.

Love Actually scriptwriter Emma Freud, Curtis's partner, has asked for ideas for the plot, external, saying the follow-up is still being written.

Many have suggested a tribute to the late Alan Rickman, who starred in the original.

Another suggestion tweeted to Freud involved Atkinson's character, who was seen in the original as a shop assistant.

Curtis said: "I would never have dreamt of writing a sequel to Love Actually, but I thought it might be fun to do 10 minutes to see what everyone is now up to.

"We hope to make something that'll be fun - very much in the spirit of the original film and of Red Nose Day."

The writer said he was "delighted" that so many of the original cast could take part, adding: "It'll certainly be a nostalgic moment getting back together."
