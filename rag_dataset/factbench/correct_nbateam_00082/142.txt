Raymond Felton may find himself in a tough spot after being traded from the New York Knicks to the Denver Nuggets on Monday night. Felton had the run of the team in New York, but now heads to Denver to battle second-year point guard Ty Lawson for playing time. It all shook out as the Carmelo Anthony mega-trade was finalized, with the Nuggets, Knicks and Minnesota Timberwolves swapping a wide-variety of players to make the deal work.

Felton is averaging 17.1 points and nine assists per game playing the bulk of the minutes for the Knicks this season. Lawson, playing in a backup role with the Nuggets, is averaging 10.4 points and 3.7 assists per game.

It's unknown which of the two will take the starters role as the trade pieces enter the fray, but the Nuggets boosted their depth at the point guard spot with the move while also getting younger. Instead of Billups, a 13-year veteran, and Lawson, a second-year man, Denver now has youth on its side, with Felton boasting five-plus years of experience.

Denver secured a haul for Anthony and Felton's experience at the point guard spot should make an immediate impact for the Nuggets.
