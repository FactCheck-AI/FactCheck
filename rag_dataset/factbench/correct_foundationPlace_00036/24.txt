[PROLOGUE.]

[Fol. 1.]

THe ſoft morow ande The luſtee Aperill,

The wynter set, the stormys in exill,

In April, when the fresh luminary upriseth,

Quhen that the brycht and freſch illumynare

4 Upriſith arly in his fyre chare

His hot courß in to the orient,

and sendeth from his sphere his golden streams,

And frome his ſpere his goldine ſtremis sent

Wpone the grond, in maner off meſag,

8 One euery thing to valkyne thar curage,

That natur haith set wnder hire mycht,

Boith gyrß, and flour, and euery luſty vicht:

And namly thame that felith the aſſay

12 Of lufe, to ſchew the kalendis of may,

Throw birdis ſonge with opine wox one hy,

That ſeſſit not one lufaris for to cry,

Leſt thai forȝhet, throw ſlewth of Ignorans,

16 The old wſage of lowis obſeruans.

and when I espy his bright face,

And from̅e I can the bricht face aſſpy,

It deuit me no langare fore to ly,

Nore that loue schuld ſleuth In to me finde,

THE POET BEWAILS HIS LOT.

I walk forth, bewailing my sad life.

20 Bot walkine furth, bewalinge in my mynde

the dredful lyve endurit al to longe,

Sufferans in loue of ſorouful harmys ſtronge,

The ſcharpe dais and the hewy ȝerys,

24 Quhill phebus thris haith paſſith al his ſperis,

Vithoutine hope ore traiſtinge of comfort;

So be such meine fatit was my sort.

Thus in my ſaull Rolinge al my wo,

The sword of love carves my heart.

28 My carful hart carwing cañ In two

The derdful ſuerd of lowis hot diſſire;

So be the morow set I was a-fyre

In felinge of the acceß hot and colde,

32 That haith my hart in ſich a fevir holde,

Only to me thare was noñe vthir eß

Bot thinkine qhow I ſchulde my lady pleß.

Quhen that I have remembrit one my thocht

My lady knoweth not how I am wobegone.

How sche, quhois bewte al my harm̅ haith wrocht,

[Fol. 1 b.]

Ne knouith not how I ame wo begoñe,

40 Nor how that I ame of hire ſeruandis oñe;

And in my ſelf I cañ nocht fynde the meyne

In to quhat wyß I ſal my wo compleine.

HE SEES A VISION OF A GREEN BIRD.

I walked thus in the field, and came to a well-beseen garden.

Thus in the feild I walkith to and froo,

44 As thochtful wicht that felt of nocht bot woo,

Syne to o gardinge, that weß weil beſeñ,

Of quiche the feild was al depaynt with greñ.

The tendyre and the luſty flouris new

48 Up thrōue the greñ vpone thar ſtalkis grew

Aȝhane the ſone, and thare levis ſpred,

Quharwith that al the gardinge was I-clede;

That pryapus, in to his tyme before,

52 In o luſtear walkith nevir more;

It was closely environed with leaves.

And al about enweronyt and Icloſit

One ſich o wyß, that none within ſuppoſit

3

Fore to be ſeñ with ony vicht thare owt;

56 So dide the levis cloſ it1 all about.

Thar was the flour, thar was the queñ alpheſt,2

Rycht wering being of the nychtis reſt,

Wncloſing gañe the crownel for the day;

The sun illumined the sprays;

60 The brycht ſone illumynit haith the ſpray,

The nychtis ſobir ande the moſt ſchowris,

As criſtoll terys withhong vpone the flouris,

Haith vpwarpith In the luſty aire,

64 The morow makith soft, ameyne, and faire;

And the byrdis thar mychty voce out-throng,

Quhill al the wood reſonite of thar ſonge,

68 That pleſſith thame of luſtenes to here.

Bot gladneß til the thochtful, euer mo

the garden was adorned with flowers.

Thar was the garding with the flouris ourfret,

72 Quich is in poſy fore my lady set,

That hire Repreſent to me oft befor,

And thane alſo; thus al day gan be ſor3

Of thocht my goſt with torment occupy,

[Fol. 2.]

I fell there into an ecstasy or sleep,

76 That I becam̅e In to one exaſy,

Ore ſlep, or how I wot; bot ſo befell

My wo haith done my livis goſt expell,

And in ſich wiß weil long I can endwr,

80 So me betid o wondir aventur.

As I thus lay, Rycht to my ſpreit vas ſeñ

and saw in my dream a green bird, who said:

A birde, yat was as ony lawrare greñ,

A-licht, and ſayth in to hir birdis chere;

THE BIRD’S MESSAGE.

84 “O woful wrech, that levis in to were!

To ſchew the thus the god of loue me ſent,

That of thi ſeruice no thing is content,

“The God of Love is discontent with thee.

For in his court yhoue lewith in diſſpar,

88 And vilfully suſtenis al thi care,

4

And ſchapith no thinge of thine awn remede,

Bot clepith ay and cryith apone dede.

Yhow callith the birdis be morow fro thar bouris,

92 Yhoue devith boith the erbis and the flouris,

And clepit hyme vnfaithful king of lowe,

Yow dewith hyme in to his rigne abufe,

Yhow tempith hyme, yhoue doith thi ſelf no gud,

You are destitute of wit.

96 Yhoue are o moñ of wit al deſtitude.

Wot yhoue nocht that al liwis creatwre

Haith of thi wo in to his hand the cwre?

Though you call on trees, your lady hears not.

And ſet yhoue clep one erbis and one treis,

100 Sche heris not thi wo, nore ȝhit ſche ſeis;

For none may know the dirkneß of thi thocht,

Ne blamyth her thi wo ſche knowith nocht.

And It is weil accordinge It be so

104 He ſuffir harme, that to redreß his wo

Previdith not; for long ore he be ſonde,

Holl of his leich, that ſchewith not his vound.

Ovid says it is better to shew, than to conceal love.

And of owid ye autor ſchall yhow knaw

108 Of lufe that ſeith, for to conſel or ſchow,

The laſt he clepith althir-beſt of two;

And that is ſuth, and ſal be euer mo.

And loue alſo haith chargit me to ſay,

[Fol. 2 b.]

112 Set yhoue preſume, ore beleif, ye aſſay

Of his ſeruice, as It wil ryne ore go,

Preſwme It not, fore It wil not be so;

Al magre thine a ſeruand ſchal yow bee.

As touching thine adversity, seek the remedy.”

116 And as tueching thine aduerſytee,

Complen and sek of the ramed, the cwre,

Ore, gif yhow likith, furth thi wo endure.”

And, as me thocht, I anſuerde aȝaiñe

Then answered I:

120 Thus to the byrde, in wordis ſchort and plane:

“It ganyth not, as I have harde Recorde,

The ſeruand for to diſput with ye lord;

“Love knows the reason of my wo.”

Bot well he knowith of al my vo the quhy,

124 And in quhat wyß he hath me ſet, quhar I

5

Nore may I not, nore can I not attane,

Nore to hir hienes dare I not complane.”

SHE BIDS HIM WRITE A POEM.

“Fool,” said the bird, “despair not;

“Ful!” quod the bird, “lat be thi nyß diſpare,

128 For in this erith no lady is ſo fare,

So hie eſtat, nore of ſo gret empriß,

The god of love thus chargit the, at ſchort,

136 That to thi lady yhoue thi wo Report;

Yf yhoue may not, thi plant ſchall yhov vrit.

And, for thir ſedulis and thir billis are

Sum trety ſchall yhoue for yi lady ſak,

That wnkouth is, als tak one hand and mak,

Of love, ore armys, or of ſum othir thing,

148 That may hir one to thi Remembryng brynge;

[Fol. 3.]

Qwich ſoundith Not one to no hewynes,

Bot one to gladneß and to luſteneß,

one that may please her and get her thanks.

That yhoue belevis may thi lady pleß,

152 To have hir thonk and be one to hir eß;

That ſche may wit in ſeruice yhow art one.

Farewell, and be merry.”

Faire weil,” quod ſche, “thus ſchal yhow the diſpone,

And mak thi ſelf als mery as yhoue may,

156 It helpith not thus fore to wex al way.”

With that, the bird ſche haith hir leif tak,

Thereon I awoke, and wondered what it might mean.

For fere of quich I can onone to wak;

Sche was ago, and to my ſelf thocht I

160 Quhat may yis meyne? quhat may this ſignify?

6

Is It of troucht, or of Illuſioune?

HE RESOLVES TO DO SO.

Bot finaly, as in concluſioune,

Be as be may, I ſchal me not discharge,

164 Sen It apperith be of lovis charg;

And ek myne hart noñe othir biſſynes

Haith bot my ladice ſeruice, as I geß;

I determined to take in hand this occupation.

Among al vtheris I ſchal one honde tak

168 This litil occupatioune for hire ſak.

Bot hyme I pray, the mychty gode of loue,

That ſitith hie in to his ſpir abuf,

(At command of o wyß quhois viſioune

172 My goſt haith takin this opvnioune,)

That my lawboure may to my lady pleß

And do wnto hir ladeſchip ſum eß,

So that my trauell be nocht tynt, and I

176 Quhat vtheris ſay ſetith nothing by.

I know it will but hurt my name, when men hear my feeble negligence.

For wel I know that, be this worldis fam̅e.

It ſchal not be bot hurting to my nam̅e,

Quhen that thai here my febil negligens,

180 That empit is, and bare of eloquens,

Of diſcreſſioune, and ek of Retoryk;

The metire and the cuning both elyk

So fere diſcording frome perfeccioune;

I submit my poem to the correction of the wise;

184 Quhilk I ſubmyt to the correccioune

Of yaim the quhich that is diſcret and wyß,

And enterit is of loue in the ſeruice;

[Fol. 3 b.]

Quhich knouyth that no lovare dare withſtonde,

188 Quhat loue hyme chargit he mot tak one honde,

Deith, or defam̅, or ony maner wo;

And at this tyme with me It ſtant rycht ſo,

for I dare not oppose Love’s command.

As I that dar makine no demande

192 To quhat I wot It lykith loue commande.

Tueching his chargis, as with al deſtitut,

Within my mynd ſchortly I conclud

For to fulfyll, for ned I mot do ſo.

HE THINKS OF THE STORY OF LANCELOT.

196 Thane in my thocht rolling to and fro

7

Quhare that I myhct ſum wnkouth mater fynde,

At last I thought of the story of “Lancelot of the Lake,”

Quhill at ye laſt it fell in to my mynd

Of o ſtory, that I befor had ſene,

200 That boith of loue and armys can conteñ,

Of quhois fame and worſchipful dedis

of whom I here think to write something.

Of quhome I thynk her ſum thing for to writ

At louis charge, and as I cane, endit;

Set men tharin ſal by experiens

208 Know my conſait, and al my negligens.

But because my ignorance cannot comprehend the French romance,

Bot for that ſtory is ſo paſing larg,

One to my wit It war ſo gret o charg

For to tranſlait the romans of that knycht;

212 It paſſith fare my cunyng and my mycht,

THE DEDICATION.

But I pray for the support of a very great poet,

Bot first I pray, and I beſek also,

320 Flour of poyetis, quhois nome I wil report

To me nor to noñ vthir It accordit,

In to our rymyng his nam̅ to be recordit;

For ſum ſuld deme It of preſumpſioune,

for our riming is but derision, when his excellence is remembered.

324 And ek our rymyng is al bot deryſioune,

Quhen that remembrit is his excellens,

So hie abuf that ſtant in reuerans.

Ye freſch enditing of his laiting toung

The world knows his eloquence in inditing Latin;

328 Out throuch yis world ſo wid is yroung,

Of eloquens, and ek of retoryk;

Nor is, nor was, nore neuer beith hyme lyk,

and none can ever gladden the world like him:

This world gladith of his ſuet poetry.

332 His ſaul I blyß conſeruyt be for-thy;

to him be the thanks for my success.

And yf that ony lusty terme I wryt

He haith the thonk yerof, and this endit.

ARTHUR AT CARLISLE.

[BOOK I.]

[Fol. 5 b.]

Quhen [that] tytan, withe his lusty heit,

336 Twenty dais In to the aryeit

When Titan, being in Aries, had apparelled the fields,

Haith maid his courß, and all with diuerß hewis

Aparalit haith the feldis and the bewis;

and birds began to make their bowers;

The birdis amyd the erbis and the flouris,

340 And one the branchis, makyne gone thar bouris,

And be the morow ſinging in ther chere

Welcum to the luſty ſeſſone of the ȝere.

In to this tyme the worthi conqueroure

king Arthur was at Carlisle.

344 Arthure, wich had of al this worlde the floure

Of cheuelry auerding to his crown,

So paſing war his knychtis in renoune,

Was at carlill; and hapynnit ſo that hee

348 Soiornyt well long in that faire cuntree.

His knights, hearing of no adventure, were annoyed.

In to whilk tyme In to the court thai heire

None awenture, for wich the knyghtis weire

Anoit all at the abiding thare.

352 For-why, beholding one the ſobir ayre

And of the tyme the paſing luſtynes,

Can ſo thir knyghtly hartis to encreß,

They therefore sent Sir Kay to pray the king to go to Camelot.

That thei ſhir kay one to the king haith ſende,

356 Beſeiching hyme he wold wichſaif to wende

To camelot the Cetee, whare that thei

Ware wont to heryng of armys day be day.

The king forſuth, heryng thare entent,

360 To thare deſir, be ſchort awyſment,

The king proposed to do so on the morrow.

Ygrantid haith; and ſo the king proponit

12

And for to pas hyme one8 the morne diſponit.

ARTHUR’S TWO DREAMS.

Bot ſo befell hyme [on] that nycht to meit

364 An aperans, the wich one to his ſpreit

That night he dreamt that his hair all fell off;

It ſemyth that of al his hed ye hore

Of fallith and maid deſolat; wharfore

The king therof was pensyve in his mynd,

368 That al the day he couth no reſting fynde,

which made him delay his journey.

Wich makith hyme his Iorneye to delaye.

And ſo befell apone the thrid day,

The bricht ſone, paſing in the weſt,

372 Haith maid his courß, and al thing goith to Reſt;

Again he dreamt, that his bowels fell out, and lay beside him.

The king, ſo as the ſtory can dewyß,

He thoght aȝeine, apone the ſamyne wyß,

[Fol. 6.]

His vombe out fallith vith his hoil syde

376 Apone the ground, and liging hyme beſid;

Throw wich anon out of his ſlep he ſtert,

Abaſit and adred in to his hart.

He told the queen, who answered, “No man should respect vain dreams.”

The wich be morow one to the qwen he told,

380 And ſhe aȝeine to hyme haith anſuer ȝolde;

“To dremys, ſir, ſhuld no man have Reſpek,

For thei ben thingis weyn, of non affek.”

“Well,” quod the king, “god grant It ſo befall!”

The king next shewed his dream to a clerk,

384 Arly he roß, and gert one to hyme call

O clerk, to whome that al his hewynes

Tweching his drem ſhewith he expreß,

who said, “Sir, such things testify nothing.”

Wich anſuer yaf and ſeith one to the kinge;

388 “Shir, no Record lyith to ſuch thing;

Wharfor now, ſhir, I praye yow tak no kep,

Nore traiſt in to the vanyteis of slep;

For thei are thingis that aſkith no credens,

392 But cauſith of ſum maner influens,

Empriß of thoght, ore ſuperfleuytee,

Or than ſum othir caſualytee.”

“Yet,” replied he, “I shall not leave it so.”

“Ȝit,” quod the king, “I ſal nocht leif It so;”

HE SENDS FOR HIS CLERKS.

396 And furth he chargit meſingeris to go

Throgh al his Realm, withouten more demande,

He bade all the bishops and clergy come to Camelot within twenty days.

And bad them ſtratly at thei ſhulde comande

All the biſhopes, and makyng no delay

400 The ſhuld appere be the tuenty day

13

At camelot, with al thar hol clergy

404 The meſag goith furth with the lettres Right.

The king eft ſone, within a litill ſpace,

His Iornay makith haith frome place to place,

He goes to Camelot, and finds the clerks assembled.

Whill that he cam to camelot; and there

408 The clerkis all, as that the chargit were,

Aſſemblit war, and came to his preſens,

Of his deſir to viting the ſentens.

To them that war to hyme moſt ſpeciall

412 Furth his entent ſhauyth he al hall;

He discloses all to the ten that are most expert,

By whois conſeil, of the worthieſt

He cheſith ten, yclepit for the beſt,

And moſt expert and wiſeſt was ſuppoſit,

[Fol. 6 b.]

416 To qwhome his drem all hail he haith diſcloſſit;

The houre, the nyght, and al the cercumſtans;

and beseeches them to explain the dreams.

Beſichyne them that the ſignifycans

Thei wald hyme ſhaw, that he mycht reſting fynde

420 Of It, the wich that occupeid his mynde.

And one of them with9 al ther holl aſſent

One of them asks for nine days to advise upon the matter.

Saith, “ſhire, fore to declare our entent

Vpone this matere, ye wil ws delay

424 Fore to awyſing one to the ix day.”

The king ther-to grantith haith, bot hee

The king complies, but shuts them up in a strong place.

In to o place, that ſtrong was and hye,

He cloſith them, whare thei may no whare get,

428 Vn to the day, the wich he to them set.

Than goith the clerkis ſadly to awyß

Of this mater, to ſeing in what wyß

The knight’s message is that king Galiot bids Arthur to yield to him his kingdom.

“Shir king, one to yow am y ſende

548 Frome the worthieſt that in world is kend,

This is my charge at ſhort, whilk if youe leſt

The king refuses.

By ſhort awys the king his anſuer yald;

For I as yit, in tymys that ar gone,

Nore neuer thinkith til erthly lord to yef

564 Trybut nor rent, als long as I may lef.”

The knight replies, that his lord bids him defiance, and will invade his land in a month;

“Well,” quod the knycht, “ful ſor repentith me;

Non may reciſt the thing the wich mone bee.

ARTHUR DEFIES GALIOT.

Arthur returns his defiance.

“Schir,” quod the king, “your meſag me behufis

580 Of reſone and of curtaſy excuſß;

But tueching to your lord and to his oſt,

The knight departs, lamenting Arthur’s adventurous spirit.

588 With that the knycht, withouten leif, is went,

And richt as he was paſing to the dure,

The knicht is gon, the king he gan Inquere

And to the king he ſaith, “ſir, I haue sen

“A hundred thousand,” is the reply.

“An hundreth thouſand boith vith ſheld and ſpere

The king says he will set off that very night.

Than ſeith his knychtis al with one aſſent,

His knights advise him to wait till he has raised an army.

“Shir, that is al contrare our entent;

He refuses to wait longer than till the morrow.

If that I mak abid or reſydens

LANCELOT PRAYS TO BE RELEASED.

[Fol. 12 b.]

And he aroß and ſaluſt Curtaſly

Lancelot beseeches her to appoint his ransom,

920 The lady, and ſaid, “madem, her I,

THE LADY AT FIRST REFUSES;

“Shire knycht, It ſtant nocht in ſich dugree;

She replies that she does not want a ransom, but has imprisoned him for his guilt.

936 It is no ranſone wich that cauſith me

To holden yow, or don yow ſich offens;

It is your gilt, It is your wiolens,

Whar-of that I deſir no thing but law,

940 Without report your awñ treſpas to knaw.”

“Madem, your pleſance may ye wel fulfill

Of me, that am in preſone at your will.

He prays for pardon,

She consents, if he will specify to her his name.

“Sir knycht,” quod ſhe, “I grant yow leif, withthy

“Madem, as ȝit, ſutly I ne may

Thus thei accord, the lady goith to reſt,

The ferd day was dewyſit for to bee

Betuex the oſtis of the aſſemblee.

And galiot Richt arly by the day,

Galiot assembles 40,000 fresh men.

And fourty thouſand armyt men haith he,

Arthur also provides his men for the field.

The knights of Melyhalt join him.

The lady secretly provides Lancelot with a red courser, and a shield and spear, both red also.

And the lady haith, in to ſacret wyß,

And he, to qwham the preſone hath ben ſmart,

He rides towards the field, and halts in a plain by the river-side.

Towart the feld anon he gan to ryd,

996 And in o plan houit one reuer syde.

LANCELOT ENCOURAGES HIMSELF.

This knycht, the wich that long haith ben in cag,

Lancelot is encouraged, seeing the blithe morn, the mead, the river, the green woods, and the knights and banners.

He grew in to o freſch and new curage,

Seing the morow blythfull and amen,

1000 The med, the Reuer, and the vodis gren,

The knychtis in [ther] armys them arayinge,

[Fol. 13 b.]

The baneris ayaine the feld diſplayng,

His ȝouth in ſtrenth and in proſperytee,

1004 And ſyne of luſt the gret aduerſytee.24

Thus in his thocht remembryng at the laſt,

Casting his eyes aside, he sees the queen looking over a parapet.

Efterward one ſyd he gan his Ey to caſt,

1008 Out to the feld luking was the qwen;

Sudandly with that his goſt aſtart

Love catches him by the heart.

Of loue anone haith caucht hyme by the hart;

Than ſaith he, “How long ſhall It be so,

Apone this wyß to be Infortunat,

He counsels his heart to help itself at need,

THE RED KNIGHT’S TRANCE.

Confused with a heavy thought,

With that confuſit with an hewy thocht,

Wich ner his deith ful oft tyme haith hyme ſocht,

Deuoydit was his spritis and his goſt,

1032 He wiſt not of hyme-ſelf nor of his oſt;

Bot one his horß, als ſtill as ony ſton.

When that the knychtis armyt war ilkon,

The bugles are blown, and the knights are ready on horseback, 20,000 in number.

To warnnyng them vp goith the bludy ſown,

1036 And euery knyght vpone his horß is bown;

Twenty thouſand armyt men of were.

The king that day he wold non armys bere;

His batellis ware devyſit euerilkon,

They are forbidden to cross the fords, but cannot be restrained.

1040 And them forbad out our the furdis to gon.

Bot frome that thei ther ennemys haith sen,

[Fol. 14.]

Bot ovr thei went vithouten more delay,

1044 And can them one that oyer sid aſſay.

The red knight still halting by the ford, a herald seizes his bridle, and bids him awake.

The red knycht ſtill in to his hewy thoght

Was hufyng ȝit apone the furd, and noght

1048 And ſone the knycht he be the brydill nom,

Saying, “awalk! It is no tyme to ſlep;

Your worſchip more expedient vare to kep.”

No word he ſpak, ſo prikith hyme the ſmart

1052 Of hevynes, that ſtood vnto his hart.

Two shrews next approach; one takes his shield off his neck,

Two ſcrewis cam with that, of quhich [that] oñ

the other casts water at his ventayle, which causes him to wink, and arouse himself.

That vthir watter takith atte laſt,

When that he felt the vatter that vas cold,

He wonk, and gan about hyme to behold,

And thinkith how he ſum-quhat haith myſgoñ.

1060 With that his ſpere In to his hand haith ton,

THE RED KNIGHT FIGHTS LIKE A LION.

He goes to the field, and sees the first-conquest king.

Goith to the feild withouten vordis more;

So was he vare whare that there cam before,

32

O manly man he was in to al thing,

1064 And clepit was the ferſt-conquest king.

The Red knycht with [the] ſpuris ſmat the ſted,

The tother cam, that of hyme hath no drede;

They meet.

With ferß curag ben the knychtis met,

1068 The king his ſpere apone the knycht hath set,

That al in peciß flaw in to the felde;

The red knight, though shieldless, overthrows his foe.

His hawbrek helpit, ſuppos he had no ſcheld.

And he the king in to the ſcheld haith ton,

1072 That horß and man boith to the erd ar gon.

The shrew restores his shield.

Than to the knycht he cummyth, that haith tan

Beſiching hyme that of his Ignorance,

1076 That knew hyme nat, as takith no grewance.

The knycht his ſche[l]d but mor delay haith tak,

And let hyme go, and no thing to hyme ſpak.

Than thei the26 wich that ſo at erth haith ſen

The men of the first-conquest king come to the rescue.

1080 Ther lord, the ferſt-conqueſt king, y meñ,

And manfully thei haith ther king Releuit.

[A]nd Arthuris folk, that lykith not to byde,

1084 In goith the spuris in the ſtedis syde;

[Fol. 14 b.]

To-giddir thar aſſemblit al the oſt:

At whois meting many o knycht was loſt.

The battle was right cruel to behold.

The batell was richt crewell to behold,

1088 Of knychtis wich that haith there lyvis ȝolde.

One to the hart the ſpere goith throw the ſcheld,

The knychtis gaping lyith in the feld.

The red knycht, byrnyng in loues fyre,

1092 Goith to o knycht, als ſwift as ony vyre,

The wich he perſit throuch and throuch the hart;

The red knight loses his spear, but draws his sword, and roams the field like a lion.

The ſpere is went; with that anon he ſtart,

And out o ſuerd in to his hond he tais;

1096 Lyk to o lyone in to the feld he gais,

33

In to his Rag ſmyting to and fro

Fro ſum the arm, fro ſum the nek in two,

Sum in the feild lying is in ſwoun,

Some he cleaves to the belt.

1100 And sum his ſuerd goith to the belt al douñe.

For qwhen that he beholdith to the qwen,

Who had ben thore his manhed to haue sen,

1104 Shwld ſay in world war not ſuch o wight.

His fellows take comfort from his deeds,

His falouſchip siche comfort of his dede

Haith ton, that thei ther ennemys ne dreid;

But can them-self ay manfoly conten

1108 In to the ſtour, that hard was to ſuſten;

though Galiot’s host was a surpassing multitude.

For galyot was O paſing multitude

Of prewit men in armys that war gude,

The wich can with o freſch curag aſſaill

1112 Ther ennemys that day In to batell;

Had it not been for the manhood of the red knight, Arthur’s folk had been in peril.

That ne ware not the vorſchip and manhede

Of the red knycht, in perell and in dreid

Arthuris folk had ben, vith-outen vere;

1116 Set thei var good, thei var of ſmal powere.

GAWANE BEHOLDS THE RED KNIGHT.

Gawane is led to the parapet,

And gawan, wich gart bryng hyme-ſelf befor

To the bertes, set he was vondit sore,

Whar the qwen vas, and whar that he mycht see

1120 The manere of the oſt and aſſemble;

And when that he the gret manhed haith sen

and saith to the queen, that none ever did better than yon red knight.

Of the red knycht, he ſaith one to the qwen,

“Madem, ȝone knyght in to the armys Rede,

1124 Nor neuer I hard nore ſaw in to no ſted

O knycht, the wich that in to ſchortar ſpace

In armys haith mor forton nore mor grace;

Nore bettir doith boith with ſper and ſcheild,

[Fol. 15.]

1128 He is the hed and comfort of our feild.”

The queen prays for Lancelot.

“Now, ſir, I traiſt that neuer more vas ſen

No man in feild more knyghtly hyme conten;

I pray to hyme that euery thing hath cure,

1132 Saif hyme fro deth or wykit aduenture.”

34

The field was perilous on both sides,

The feild It was rycht perellus and ſtrong

On boith the ſydis, and continewit long,

from early morn till the sun had gone down.

Ay from the ſone the varldis face gan licht

1136 Whill he was gone and cumyne vas the nycht;

And than o forß thei mycht It not aſſtart,

On euery ſyd behouit them depart.

Every knight then returns home, and the red knight privily goes back to the city.

The feild is don and ham goith euery knycht,

1140 And prevaly, unwiſt of any wicht,

The way the red knycht to the cete taiis,

As he had hecht, and in his chambre gais.

When arthure hard how the knycht Is gon,

1144 He blamyt ſore his lordis euerilk-one;

And oft he haith remembrit in his thoght,

Arthur, seeing the multitude of Galiot’s men, recalls his dream, saying,

What multitud that galiot had broght;

Seing his folk that ware so ewil arayt,

1148 In to his mynd he ſtondith al affrayt,

And ſaith, “I traiſt ful ſuth It ſal be founde

My drem Richt as the clerkis gan expounde;

“My men now fail me at need.”

For why my men failȝeis now at neid,

1152 My-ſelf, my londe, in perell and in dreide.”

GALIOT PROPOSES A TRUCE.

Galiot tells his council

And galiot vpone hie worſchip set,

And his conſell anon he gart be fet,

To them he ſaith, “with arthur weil ȝe see

1156 How that It ſtant, and to qwhat degre,

Wharfor, me think It beſt is to delay,

And reſput hyme for a tuelmoñeth day,

And thus concludit thoght hyme for the beſt.

The very knychtis paſſing to there Reſt;

The lady of Melyholt asks her knights who hath won most honour.

Tharwith one to his armys ar thei went;

If hyme the horß one wich thi-ſelwyne Ridith,

And bid hyme that he Rid hyme for yhour ſak;

1724 Syne til hyme gold and ſiluer yow betak;

The horß to hyme for worſchip and prowes,

The treſor for his fredome and larges.

[Fol. 22 a.]

If moſt of Riches and of Cheriſing;

1728 Eftir this gud knycht berith vitneſing.

Give to thy tenants and vavasours easy hackneys, palfries, and coursers.

Syne to thi tennandis & to thi wawaſouris

If eſſy haknays, palfrais, and curſouris,

And robis ſich as pleſand ben and fair;

1732 Syne to thi lordis, wich at mychty aire,

Give to thy lords things strange and uncouth.

As dukis, erlis, princis, and ek kingis,

Yow if them ſtrang, yow if them vncouth thingis,

As diuerß iowellis, and ek preciouß ſtonis,

1736 Or halkis, hundis, ordinit for the nonis,

Or wantone horß that can nocht ſtand in ſtāble;

Thar giftis mot be fair and delitable.

Thus, firſt vn to the vorthi pur yow if

1740 Giftis, that may ther pouerte Releif;

And to the rich iftis of pleſans,

That thei be fair, ſet nocht of gret ſubſtans;

For riches aſkith no thing bot delyt,

1744 And powert haith ay ane appetyt

For to support ther ned and Indigens:

Thus ſhall yow if and makith thi diſpens.

So, too, shall the queen give to maidens and ladies,

And ek the quen, my lady, ſhalt alſo

1748 To madenis and to ladeis, quhar ȝhe go,

If, and cheriß one the ſamyne wyß;

for all thy welfare lies in liberality.

For in to largeß al thi welfar lyis.

And if thy giftis with ſich continans

The wyß man ſais, and ſuth it is approuit,

Thar is no thonk, thar is no ift alowit,

52

Bot It be ifyne In to ſich manere,

Remember that the giver should be as glad in his cheer as the receiver.

1756 (That is to ſay, als glaid in to his chere),

As he the wich the ift of hyme Reſauith;

And do he not, the gifar is diſſauith.

For who that iffis, as he not if wald,

1760 Mor profit war his ift for to with-hald;

His thonk he tynith, and his ift alſo.

Bot that thow ifith, if with boith two,

Give with both hand and heart at once;

That is to ſay, vith hart and hand atonis;

1764 And ſo the wyſman ay ye ift diſponis.

Beith larg and iffis frely of thi thing;

for liberality is the treasure of a king.

For largeß is the treſour of o king,

And not this other Iowellis nor this gold

1768 That is in to thi treſory with-holde.

[Fol. 22 b.]

Who gladly iffith, be vertew of larges

Whoso gives liberally, his treasury increases.

His treſory encreſis of Richeſß,

And ſal aȝañe the mor al-out reſawe.

LIBERAL KINGS ARE LOVED IN LIFE,

For the receiver shall place his goods at the king’s disposal,

1772 For he to quhome he ȝewith ſall hawe,

Firſt his body, ſyne his hart with two,

His gudis al for to diſpone also

who shall gain, moreover, both worship and praise.

In his ſeruice; and mor atour he ſhall

1776 Have O thing, and that is beſt of all;

That is to ſay, the worſchip and the loß

That vpone larges in this world furth goß.

And yow ſhal knaw the lawbour & the preß

1780 In to this erth about the gret Richeß.

Is there any labour except for meat and clothing? All the remnant is for fame.

All the remanant ſtant apone the name

1784 Of purches, furth apone this worldis fame.

And well yow wot, in thyne allegians

Ful many Is, the wich haith ſufficians

Of euery thing that longith to ther ned;

1788 What haith yow more, qwich [haith] them al to lede,

53

For al thi Realmys and thi gret Riches,

If that yow lak of worſchip the encreß?

Well leß, al-out; for efter thar eſtate

1792 Thei have vorſchip, and kepith It al-gat;

And yow degradith al thyne hie dugree,

That ſo ſchuld ſhyne In to nobelitee,

Throuch wys and throw the wrechitneß of hart.

AND COMMENDED AFTER DEATH.

Knowest thou not what shall be thy part, when thou passest away from this world?

1796 And knowis yow not what ſall be43 thi part,

Out of this world when yow ſal paß the courß?

Fair well, I-wyß! yow neuer ſhall Recourß

Whar no prince more ſhall the subiet44 have,

1800 But be als dep in to the erd y-grave,

Virtue and honour will alone remain.

Sauf vertew only and worſchip wich abidith;

With them the world apone the laif dewidith;

And if thy successor be liberal, he will be commended of the world;

And if he, wich ſhal eftir the ſucced,

1804 By larges ſpend, of quhich that yhow had dreid,

He of the world comendit is and priſit,

And yow ſtant furth of euery thing diſpiſit;

The puple ſaith and demyth thus of thee,

1808 “Now is he gone, a werray vrech was hee,

And he the wich that is our king and lord

Boith wertew haith & larges in accorde;

Welcum be he!” and ſo the puple ſoundith.

[Fol. 23 a.]

1812 Thus through thi viß his wertew mor aboundith,

and his virtue will abound through thy vice.

And his vertew the more thi wice furth ſchawith.

Wharfor ȝhe, wich that princes ben y-knawith,

Lat not yhour vrechit hart so yhow dant,

1816 That he that cummyth next yhow may awant

To be mor larg, nore more to be commendit;

Riches well spent are the best kept.

Best kepit Is the Riches well diſpendit.

O ȝhe, the wich that kingis ben, fore ſham

1820 Remembrith yhow, this world hath bot o naam̅

Of good or ewill, efter ȝhe ar gone!

And wyſly tharfor cheſſith yhow the toñ

1824 And knytith larges to yhour hie degre.

For qwhar that fredome In O prince Ringnis,

It bryngith In the victory of kingis,

And makith realmys and puple boith to dout,

1828 And ſubectis45 of the cuntre al about.

LIBERAL KINGS WIN SUBJECTS,

Whoso will be a conqueror, let him not reck to give largely.

And qwho that thinkith ben o conquerour,

Suppos his largeß ſumquhat pas myſour,

Ne rak he nat, bot frely iffith ay;

1832 And as he wynyth, beis var al-way

To mych nor ȝhit to gredy that he hold,

Wich ſal the hartis of the puple colde.

Both love and fear spring from liberality.

And low and radour cummyth boith two

1836 Of larges; Reid and ȝhe ſal fynd It ſo.

Alexander this lord the warld that wan,

Firſt with the ſuerd of larges he began,

Alexander gave so liberally,

And as he wynith ifith largely,

1840 He rakith No thing bot of cheuelry;

Wharfor of hyme ſo paſſith the Renown,

that many cities desired to have such a lord,

That many o cetee, and many o ſtrang towñ

Of his worſchip that herith the Recorde,

1844 Diſſirith ſo to haveing ſich o lorde;

and offered themselves peaceably to him, though they were manly men of war.

And offerith them with-outen ſtrok of ſpere,

Suppos that thei war manly men of were,

But only for his gentilleß that thei

1848 Have hard; and ſo he louit was al-way

For his larges, humilitee, and manhed,

With his awn folk, that neuermore, we Reid,

[Fol. 23 b.]

For al his weris nor his gret trawell,

1852 In al his tym that thei hyme onys faill;

Bot in his worſchip al thar beſynes

Thei ſet, and lewith in to no diſtres;

Whar-throw the ſuerd of victory he berith.

Many princes bear the palm of victory, through liberality;

1856 And many prince full oft the palm werith,

55

As has ben hard, by largeß, of before,

In conqueringe of Rignis & of glore.

while miserliness hath made realms desolate.

And wrechitnes Richt ſo, in the contrar,

BUT UNJUST ONES DESPOIL THEM.

1860 Haith Realmys maid ful deſolat & bare,

And kingis broght doun from ful hie eſtat;

And who that Red ther old bukis, wat

The vicis lef, the wertew have in mynde,

1864 And takith larges In his awn kynd;

Choose the mean between prodigality and avarice.

A-myd ſtanding of the vicis two,

Prodegalitee and awerice alſo.

Wharfor her-of It nedith not to more,

1868 So mych ther-of haith clerkis vrit to-fore.

Whoso chooses to be liberal,

Bot who the wertw of larges & the law

Sal cheß, mot ned conſidir well & knaw

must understand three things: the amount he has, to whom he giveth, and the fit time for giving.

In to hyme-ſelf, and thir thre wnderſtande,

1872 The ſubſtans firſt, the powar of his land,

Whome to he iffith, and the cauß wharfore,

The nedful tyme awatith euermore.

Kepith thir thre; for qwho that ſal exced

1876 His rent, he fallith ſodandly in nede.

(1) The king that becomes indigent overthrows his subjects.

And ſo the king, that on to myſter drowis,

His subiettis and his puple he our-thrawis,

And them diſpolȝeith boith of lond and Rent;

1880 So is the king, ſo is the puple ſchent.

For the voice of the oppressed shrieketh up ceaselessly to heaven;

For-quhi the woice It ſcrik[i]th vp ful ewyne

With-out abaid, and paſſith to the hewyne,

Whar god hyme-ſelf reſauith ther the crye

1884 Of the oppreſioune and the teranny,

and God smiteth down with the sword of vengeance.

And vith the ſuerd of wengans doun y-ſmytith,
