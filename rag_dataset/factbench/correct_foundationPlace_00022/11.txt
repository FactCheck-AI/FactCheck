The Nemetschek Innovation Foundation, founded in 2020, promotes expertise and excellence in the construction industry in the areas of research, teaching, innovation and academic life. In particular, the institution aims to actively support Germany in taking a leading role in the technologically, economically and societally critical future field of artificial intelligence (AI). The use of AI is one of the most important pillars of the construction industry of the future and raises the digitalization of the construction industry to the next level. Today digital solutions are already making a significant contribution to designing, building and managing buildings with greater efficiency, cost-effectiveness and sustainability.

To the end, what is needed is the support of strategic and university-based research as well as the promotion of research-oriented training and innovations. In order to ensure a solid allocation of resources, funding is provided for Foundation professorships and Foundation institutes at universities and colleges.

In keeping with this mindset, the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation together with the Munich Technical University (TUM) laid the cornerstone for a research and teaching institute, the only one of its kind worldwide, and established the “TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute Artificial Intelligence for the Built World” in November 2020. The cooperation agreement envisages that the Foundation makes project funding available in addition to basic funding for the operation of the institute. This serves to promote research competitions to be held university-wide in which scientists from TUM as well as external experts can take part.

The Nemetschek Innovation Foundation sees its commitment as a contribution to strengthening Germany as a research site and Munich as a high-tech site.
