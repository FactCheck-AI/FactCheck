Early Life

Charles Dance was born Walter Charles Dance on October 10, 1946, in Redditch, Worcestershire, England. His father, Walter, was an electrical engineer and had served as a sergeant in South Africa during the Second Boer War. After Walter passed away in 1949, Dance grew up in Plymouth, Devon, with mother Eleanor, stepfather Harold Burfield, and five siblings. In 2017, Charles appeared on the U.K. television series "Who Do You Think You Are?" and discovered that his father had been in his seventies at the time of his death, not his early fifties like Dance had believed, and that Walter's first marriage had produced two daughters, Norah and Mary, who both passed away before Charles found out about them. Norah died in her mid-nineties in 1993, and Mary died at age five in 1908 after a tragic accident. Dance attended Widey Technical School for Boys, Plymouth College of Art, and the Leicester College of Arts, and he studied photography and graphic design.
