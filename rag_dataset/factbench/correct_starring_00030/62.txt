ABOUT THE SHOW

Disney's Camp Rock The Musical, a combination of The Disney Channel's Camp Rock and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (starring teen idols Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers), is a classic story of rivalry and power. The story opens with Mitchie and her friends arriving at Camp Rock, ready to spend another summer jamming out and having the time of their lives. But the new, flashy Camp Star across the lake now threatens Camp Rock's very existence. To keep the doors open, Mitchie steps up, rallies her fellow Camp Rockers, and gets them into top shape for the ultimate showdown!
