At long last, the world may be getting what it’s been desperately waiting for for seven years: Camp Rock 3. Demi Lovato, who starred alongside the Jonas brothers in the Disney classics Camp Rock (2008) and Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010), stopped by Ellen on Wednesday, where she dropped the good news. And even better: If it gets made, the film could be R-rated.

“We want to come out with an R-rated Camp Rock 3,” Lovato said. “All of our fans have now grown up, so anybody that watched Camp Rock is now older and can appreciate, like, an American Pie version.”

Exactly how they’ll make the movie so it gets an R rating is still up in the air. When playing a game of 5-Second Rule with Ellen DeGeneres, Lovato suggested it might have a sex scene. One thing that will almost certainly be in the film if this dream comes true: cursing. And cursing is definitely something Lovato’s comfortable with.

“It’s something I do all day, every day,” Lovato said.
