Demi Lovato takes a walk down memory lane in a new clip released ahead of her Simply Complicated documentary, in which she revisits the time she first kissed — and fell in love with — Camp Rock co-star Joe Jonas.

In a fun promo video posted to spread the word about her upcoming YouTube film, the singer looks back on being a child pageant winner and starring in the Disney Channel movie role that put her on the map in 2008.

“Oh my god, wait,” she tells her friends as they’re huddled around a laptop, watching a Mitchie and Shane moment from Camp Rock. “This is the moment I friggin’ fell in love with him, in real life. I wasn’t acting much. We had our first kiss on camera.”

The relationship only lasted “like a month or two” back when they were teens, she admits — but fans of both should appreciate her sweet reaction. Check it out below, and watch her new documentary on Oct. 17.
