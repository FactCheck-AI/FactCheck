Harry S. Truman, the 33rd president of the United States, was born in 1884, in this house in Lamar, Missouri. His father was a mule salesman, and bought the house from its builder when it was new, in 1882, for $685. They moved out ten months later, to a farm in Harrisonville, and sold the house in Lamar. The house was later owned by a cousin of Wyatt Earp, who sold it to the United Auto Workers in 1956 for $6,000, so they could donate it to the state. The UAW installed a stone memorial at the site to commemorate their benevolence. The stone monument says that Truman was the 32nd president, though he is largely understood to be the 33rd. They might have been confused by Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms, and is officially known as both the 22nd and the 24th President. So they may not be wrong, just out of step with convention. Truman was on hand when the site was dedicated as the Harry S. Truman Birthplace State Historic Park, on his 75th birthday in 1959. Since he was ten months old when he left, he had no memories to offer. There is a small visitor center across the street, with regular, though limited, open hours.
