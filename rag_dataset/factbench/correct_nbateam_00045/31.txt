The Golden State Warriors have traded forward Gerald Wallace and a draft consideration to the Philadelphia 76ers for forward Jason Thompson, the teams announced on Friday.

The Warriors acquired Wallace in the recent trade that sent forward David Lee to the Boston Celtics.

Wallace, 33, played in 32 games for the Celtics last season. He averaged 1.1 points and 1.8 rebounds while shooting 41.2% from the floor in 8.9 minutes per game. Wallace's scoring average was a career-low and far below his 11.9 career average.

Thompson, 29, was traded along with Nik Stauskas and Carl Landry to the 76ers from the Sacramento Kings earlier this month. Thompson averaged 6.1 points and 6.5 rebounds in 81 games last season, starting 63.
