WICHITA, Kan. (KWCH) - All hopes for a second president from the Kennedy family during the 1960s were eliminated when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suffered the same fate as his older brother John in 1968.

John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963; about 4 1/2 years later, on June 5, 1968, Robert Kennedy was shot by Sirhan Sirhan at the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles. He was pronounced dead the following day.

Robert Kennedy served as U.S. attorney general under his brother, serving as John’s close advisor. In 1968, Robert Kennedy was a U.S. senator and the leading Democratic presidential candidate, having won the South Dakota and California primaries a day before he was shot. After he addressed supporters at the Ambassador hotel, he was shot by Sirhan, who fired multiple shots.

Kennedy died about 25 hours later, and he’s buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Sirhan was sentenced to death, but in 1972 his sentence was changed to life in prison with the possibility of parole. His parole request has been denied multiple times. Kennedy’s son, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is an independent candidate for president in the 2024 election.
