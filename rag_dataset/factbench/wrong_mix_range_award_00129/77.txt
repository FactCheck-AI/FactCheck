(JTA) — Today’s Google doodle honors the 127th birthday of Nelly Sachs (1891-1970), the Jewish poet and refugee from Germany who shared the Nobel Prize in literature with the Israeli writer S.Y. Agnon in 1966.

Exiled to Sweden during World War II, Sachs was largely obscure in her adopted country. There she wrote lyrical and haunting poems touching on the Holocaust, her fears about the budding state of Israel and what the Jewish Women’s Archive called “the possibility of atrocities committed by humankind and the beauty of humanity.”
