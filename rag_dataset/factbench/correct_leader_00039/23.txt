According to reports in Dutch media, former Dutch Prime Minister Dries van Agt told an audience at a symposium on inter-religious and intercultural dialogue today that after World War II Jews should have received their own country within Germany.

According to a report in Dutch-language daily The Telegraph, the audience, which consisted of many Muslims, gave a tremendous applause after van Agt’s speech.

Van Agt also said that it is “utter nonsense” to think that a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians is possible, and therefore ridiculous to believe there’s a possibility for a two-state solution.

During his time in office van Agt was seen as being a supporter of Israel. But after leaving office in 1982 his opinion of the Jewish state took a dramatic turn. He has made claims that the “Israeli army is guilty of state terrorism” and has even launched a website devoted to the issue. He has often been labeled “The Dutch Jimmy Carter” in reference to the former U.S. President who is well known for his outspoken criticism of Israel.
