The house where the late Prime Minister Sosuke Uno was born in 1922 has been renovated into a mixed-use complex that includes a restaurant and community center.

The two-story home was bought from the Uno family by the municipal government in Moriyama, Shiga Prefecture, for the renovation.

The restaurant features Omi beef, a local speciality.

Uno was prime minister in 1989, serving only two months before a sex scandal played up by gossip magazines forced him out of office. This hasn't stopped local residents from considering the home an important asset.

"We'd like to use the house as a base to reinvigorate the town," a city official said.
