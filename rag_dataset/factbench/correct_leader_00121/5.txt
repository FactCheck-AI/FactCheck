Julius Kambarage Nyerere (April 13, 1922 - October 14, 1999), also known as Mwalimu (teacher), was President of Tanzania from 1964 to 1985. He was born in Butiama, Tanganyika.

Nyerere led Tanganyika to independence from the United Kingdom in 1961. He became the new country's first Prime Minister. The country became a republic in 1962. Nyerere was the country's first president. In 1964, Tanganyika united politically with Zanzibar and was renamed Tanzania. Nyerere was unopposed as the first president of the new country.

Nyerere used political repression against opponents. His attempt at using his socialist ideas of Ujamaa failed. This made Tanzania very poor and caused widespread starvation. He led the overthrow of Idi Amin's regime in Uganda.
