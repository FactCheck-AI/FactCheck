Kate Winslet and her director husband Sam Mendes have separated, their lawyer has confirmed.

London-based firm Schillings announced that the 34-year-old actress separated from Mendes earlier this year.

A statement released on Monday said that the split was "entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement".

"Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children. They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family," it added.

Winslet married Mendes in a private ceremony in the Caribbean in 2003. The couple have one child together, Joe. Winslet also has daughter Mia from her first marriage to Jim Threapleton.

The Titanic star split from Threapleton in 2001 after three years of marriage.
