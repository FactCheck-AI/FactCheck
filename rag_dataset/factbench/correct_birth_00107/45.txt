Paul Simon is regarded as one of rockâs most sophisticated stylists and richly contemplative songwriters, with a storied career that demonstrates a remarkable breadth of vision. Born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1941, Simon copyrighted his first song with partner Art Garfunkel when they were in their early teens. Their formative music together mixed the mass appeal of â50s rock ânâ roll with the introspection of the singer-songwriter era. (Just listen to the playful poetry of 1968âs âMrs. Robinsonâ or the existential ache of âThe Sound of Silenceââsongs you could whistle along to or subject to rigorous literary analysis.) Though he was originally associated with the folk scene, Simon became known for being a stylistic chameleon on his solo releases, drawing on gospel, jazz, Brazilian batucada and other traditions. Made in collaboration with a collection of South African musicians, his 1986 LP Graceland stands as perhaps his defining statement, solidifying his reputation for meaningfully integrating world-music idioms into his musical vocabulary. Ambitious releases like 1990âs eclectic The Rhythm of the Saints and 2000âs acclaimed Youâre the One continued this impulse. On his albums of the 2010s and 2020s, Simon explored themes of ageing, separation and loss with a muted reserve.
