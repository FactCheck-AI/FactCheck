Paul Simon: The Composer

Simon and Garfunkle placed 28 songs on the popularity charts as a duo and Paul alone added 30 more – with his final single in 2013 “You Can Call Me Al” which was number 123 on the UK charts as a re-release.

Paul Simon was born Paul Frederic Simon on October 13th, 1941 in Newark, New Jersey. Early on he was associated with Art Garfunkle on some recordings and the two first charted in December of 1957 with “Hey Schoolgirl”.

In the early days, Paul would compose as Jerry Landis, Paul Kane and True Taylor.

Eight years would pass by before the two reinvented themselves as folk singers breaking through big with the number 1 “Sounds of Silence” in late 1965.

Rather sadly, as is common, Art and Paul’s relationship was not good and a split came in 1970. The two going forward rarely spoke to one another yet – they did manage occasional collaborations.

Simon and Garfunkle were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 as a duo and Paul would be inducted as a solo in 2001. Paul’s songs were oft-recognized through the years at the top of their categories!

Paul composed songs covered by many other musicians – following is a selective listing of those.
