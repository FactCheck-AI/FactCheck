The grave of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein in the Ascension Parish Burial Ground in Cambridge.

Wittgenstein held the chair of philosophy at Cambridge University from 1939 until 1947 (his predecessor in the post, George Moore (died 1958), is buried in the same cemetery). Wittgenstein died of cancer in Cambridge in 1951.

Wittgenstein's grave attracts tributes. On a previous visit several years ago, there was a plasticene figure climbing a small ladder (the ladder in is the picture in the Wikipedia entry). As of mid March 2011, there are the oranges and fork shown, along with pleasantly encroaching daffodils.
