Biographical history

Francis Ford (1881-1953) was an American motion picture actor, director and writer. He was the elder brother and mentor of film director John Ford.

Born Francis Feeney on August 14, 1881, Francis grew up in Portland, Maine. After leaving home at an early age, Ford worked in vaudeville before working as an actor in motion pictures. Ford landed in San Antonio, TX to begin filming with Thomas H. Ince at Ince's Bison Studio, acting and by 1912 directing alongside Ince in westerns. Ford moved to Universal Pictures in early 1913. His 1913 film "Lucille Love, Girl of Mystery" was Universal's first serial, and the first of a string of popular serials starring Ford's collaborator Grace Cunard. This success catapulted him to the head of the Universal Film Manufacturing Company's shorts and serials department. In 1917, Ford founded a short-lived independent company, Fordart Films and briefly opened his own studio. After 1929 his career only continued as an actor, often playing bit parts and uncredited roles. Ford died on September 5, 1953.
