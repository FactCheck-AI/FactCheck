Jonathan Swift is buried inside St Patrick's Cathedral, Patrick St, Dublin, Ireland.

Grave of Jonathon Swift and Esther Johnson

He is buried close to Esther Johnson (known as Stella in his writings) who died twelve years before him. Swift first met Stella when he tutored her as part of his duties as private secretary to Sir William Temple. (She was only 16 years old.) The exact nature of their relationship has never been fully established. Swift, who never married, was devoted to Stella and wrote a number of poems for her including On Stella's Birthday and Stella's Distress.

Swift is best known for his long work Gulliver's Travels in which he satirised the vices of humanity. Yet he produced many other satirical poems and pamphlets including the famous: A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People from Being a Burden in which he suggested that the English rulers of Ireland should simply eat Irish children. The ferociousness of his satirical work may have contributed to his lack of success in public life and certainly offended Queen Anne.

In 1713 Swift was appointed Dean of St Patrick's, a post that he held until the end of his life. Towards the end of life he suffered from an unidentified illness with symptoms of severe dizziness, deafness and nausea which led him to believe he was becoming insane. It is now thought he was suffering from Meniere's Disease, a degenerative disorder of the middle ear.
