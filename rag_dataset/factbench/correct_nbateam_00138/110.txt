INDIANAPOLIS â€” The Indiana Pacers are sending guards Darren Collison and Dahntay Jones to the Dallas Mavericks for center Ian Mahinmi.

Jones' agent, Mark Bartelstein, confirmed the trade Thursday. Both teams declined comment.

Collison lost his starting job to George Hill late last season after starting 135 games for the Pacers in two seasons. He averaged 13.2 points and 5.1 assists two years ago and 10.4 points and 4.8 rebounds this past season.

Jones, a defensive stopper, struggled to find playing time because of Indiana's depth. He joined the Pacers for the 2009-10 season and started 31 games in three years. He averaged 5.3 points in 16.2 minutes per game last season.

Mahinmi, an athletic Frenchman, started 12 games for the Mavericks last season and averaged 5.8 points.
