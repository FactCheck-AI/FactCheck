How to Getting NBC with Limited Basic vs. Spectrum TV Packages

The exact Spectrum package you subscribe to will also determine if you receive NBC or not.

Limited Basic

Spectrum's Limited Basic package is their most affordable cable package starting at $22 per month. However, the Limited Basic package typically provides only 20-30 channels and usually does not include local affiliate stations like NBC, ABC, CBS or Fox. So with Limited Basic only, you likely won't receive NBC.

Spectrum TV Plans

Once you upgrade to one of Spectrum's full TV packages beyond Limited Basic, you will start receiving local affiliate stations, including NBC. Here are some of the Spectrum TV plans that supply NBC:

Spectrum Select - 125+ channels starting at $45/month. NBC is typically included.

Spectrum Silver - 175+ channels starting at $75/month. Includes all local affiliates like NBC.

Spectrum Gold - 200+ channels for $95/month. Contains NBC and most other major channels.

So you will need at least Select or higher to get NBC as part of your channel lineup on Spectrum. Double check at ordering to confirm NBC is supplied in your Spectrum TV plan.

How to Watching NBC on Spectrum HD Channels

In additional to standard definition channels, Spectrum also provides high-definition (HD) channels for NBC and most other major networks. NBC's HD channel on Spectrum has several potential channel placements:

Channel 1285 - Another common HD channel NBC is found on.

1000-range HD channels - NBC HD may also be supplied between channels 1000-1999.

Finding the NBC HD channel will provide you with the best picture quality and viewing experience. HD channels are included at no extra cost with your standard Spectrum TV subscription. Make sure any HD-capable TVs are configured to watch the HD channel, not standard definition.
