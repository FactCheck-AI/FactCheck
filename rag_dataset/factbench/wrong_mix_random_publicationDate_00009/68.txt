Veteran actor Kamal Haasan will receive the Outstanding Achievement in Indian Cinema award at the upcoming IIFA Weekend and Awards in Abu Dhabi.

The International Indian Film Academy (IIFA) will also honour fashion designer Manish Malhotra and actor couple Riteish Deshmukh and Genelia D'Souza at the award ceremony, to be held in Yas Island, Abu Dhabi, on May 26 and May 27.

Haasan, a multi hyphenate cinema personality who has worked across industries in India, said he is looking forward to the 2023 IIFA Awards.

"I am extremely honoured and grateful that I have been a part of many IIFAs and they are doing a great job promoting Indian cinema globally and this time I am being honoured at IIFA 2023 at Yas Island, Abu Dhabi. Excited to be present at the event," Haasan said in a statement.

Malhotra, whose credits include films such as Rangeela, Dil To Pagal Hai, and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, will also showcase an exclusive "old world charm meets the new world" collection at a fashion show as part of Sobha Realty IIFA Rocks, a sidebar event at IIFA.
