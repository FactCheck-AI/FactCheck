Chemistry professor Stephen Leone has won the 2017 American Chemical Society's Ahmed Zewail Award in Ultrafast Science and Technology. The award is sponsored by the Ahmed Zewail Endowment Fund, established by the Newport Corp.

The award is named for Nobel Laureate Ahmed Zewail, who won the prize for his studies of the transition states of chemical reactions using femtosecond spectroscopy. Leone has extended Zewail's work into shorter and shorter time dimensions. Leone's research interests include ultrafast laser investigations and attosecond physics and chemistry.
