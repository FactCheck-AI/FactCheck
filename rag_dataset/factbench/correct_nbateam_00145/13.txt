After much speculation about his NBA future, Andrew Bynum has been traded from the Los Angeles Lakers to the Philadelphia 76ers in a four-team deal, according to ESPN.

Former Orlando Magic shooting guard Jason Richardson will reportedly join Bynum in Philadelphia, while Dwight Howard will land in L.A. and Andre Iguodala will go to the Denver Nuggets.

Bynum has endured his share of trials and tribulations with the Lakers. During his seven-year career, injuries and some questionable moments on the court made him one of most scrutinized players in the NBA.

All of that changed last season, as Bynum started 60 games and had career highs in points (18.7), rebounds (11.8) and minutes per game (35.2). He emerged as the second-best center in the league, behind Dwight Howard.

With the Lakers doing all they can to get back to contention next season, it seems an odd move to trade a player like Bynum right now.

Plus, despite playing in the NBA for seven years, Bynum is just 24 years old. By comparison, Howard has played eight years in the league and is 26 years old.

Bynum will combine with Spencer Hawes and Kwame Brown in the interior for the 76ers. Philadelphia ranked 12th in blocks per game, 15th in field goal percentage and 19th in rebounding differential last season, so this will help them in that area. They sacrifice an outstanding perimeter defender in Andre Iguodala by acquiring Bynum, but Bynum will help with the post defense if he's motivated.

The future really does start now for the Lakers. They have had a busy offseason. In addition to moving Bynum, they made a major splash when they acquired Steve Nash in a sign-and-trade with Phoenix.

Bynum will take his talents to his new home, trying to bring that swagger and attitude he found last season with him. He is going to be given every opportunity to shine on his own, away from the shadow of Kobe Bryant.
