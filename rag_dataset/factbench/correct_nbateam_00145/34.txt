Philadelphia is a city with a rich history, both in basketball and, well, history.

This afternoon, the Philadelphia 76ers will combine those two when they formally introduce their new acquisitions, Andrew Bynum and Jason Richardson.

Unlike most player introductions, which are held in the bowels of the Wells Fargo Center and opened to credentialed reporters only, today's event will be held at the National Constitution Center at 6th and Market Streets in Center City and will be free and open to the public.

While the press conference isn't scheduled to begin until 12:15 p.m., the doors to the Constitution Center will open a 9:30 a.m. and fans are welcome to arrive any time after that.

The team also said that there will be a special section of seats reserved for season ticket holders so that they are guaranteed seats.
