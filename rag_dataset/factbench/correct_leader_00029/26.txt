Canadian flags will be lowered to half-mast in memory of former Prime Minister John Turner.

On September 19, Turner died surrounded by family in his Toronto home. He was 91.

Turner was born in Surrey, England, on June 7 in 1929. Later becoming an accomplished lawyer and politician, the 17th Prime Minister of Canada was elected to fill the position in 1984. Heritage Canda says he is remembered for his personal integrity and commitment to democracy. Turner served until September 17, 1984, making it the shortest amount of time a Canadain Prime Minister has held office. Turner served for three decades in public office.

The Government of Canda says the act of raising the flag to half-mast is a visual statement of the sorrow Canadians are feeling.

"The half-masting of national flags is a well-established procedure whereby countries bestow honour and express a collective sense of sorrow," the Government of Canda says on its website.

All federal buildings and establishments in Canada and the Peace Tower will be observing the change until Turner's funeral.
