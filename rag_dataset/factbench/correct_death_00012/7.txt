LOS ANGELES — Organizers say a two-day auction of more than 700 costumes, scripts, awards and memorabilia from the estate of film star John Wayne brought in $5.4 million.

Heritage Auctions said Friday that the auction included items such as Wayne’s last driver’s license, a holster and gun belt from the film “El Dorado” and an eye patch from the 1969 movie, “True Grit.”

The green wool beret Wayne wore in “The Green Berets,” went for $179,250 and a cowboy hat worn in “Big Jake” and “The Cowboys” fetched $119,500.

The items had been kept by Wayne’s family since his 1979 death from cancer.

A portion of the proceeds will be used by the John Wayne Cancer Foundation to help fund cancer research, treatment and education.
