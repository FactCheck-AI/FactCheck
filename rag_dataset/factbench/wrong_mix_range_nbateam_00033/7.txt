Shawn Marion scored a season-high 26 points as the Dallas Mavericks thrashed the Golden State Warriors 116-91 on Saturday. OJ Mayo added 19 for Dallas, who led by 27 points in the second quarter to quickly put an end to the contest.

Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki had 15 points as the Mavericks avenged two losses to the Warriors earlier in the season. Golden State's Stephen Curry had 18 points on eight-of-23 shooting but lacked support.

The Denver Nuggets' 111-103 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers put the team on its longest winning streak since the 2004-05 season. Danilo Gallinari scored 19 points and Kenneth Faried added 17 for the Nuggets. Kyrie Irving led Cleveland with 26 points, but was plagued by foul trouble. The Cavaliers' three-game winning streak was halted and they still haven't won four in a row since LeBron James left for Miami three years ago.

Isaiah Thomas scored 25 points and Marcus Thornton had 24 as the Sacramento Kings defeated the Utah Jazz 120-109. It was a boisterous crowd of 16,193 that was chanting "Sacramento!" just before tipoff in support of the Kings, who could be sold and move to Seattle next season. The Kings enjoyed the support, having come off a recent dismal road trip that contributed to a run of eight losses in nine games. Alec Burks had a career-high 24 points for the Jazz.

Charlie Villanueva hit a three-pointer with 9.7 seconds left, then Rodney Stuckey sealed the win with two free throws to give the Detroit Pistons a 105-100 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks. With the scores tied, the Pistons worked the ball to Villanueva, who got it at the top of the key and swished a three. On the Bucks' next possession, Jennings fired up a 31-foot three-point attempt with 3.2 seconds left. Stuckey's two free throws with 1.6 seconds remaining were the final margin.
