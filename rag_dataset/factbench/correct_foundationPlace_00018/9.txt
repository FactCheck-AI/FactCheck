Wipro Limited is an Indian multinational information technology (IT) services company headquartered in Bangalore. It was founded in 1945 as a consumer products company, but by the 1990s had largely shifted to computing and software technology, and is today one of India's largest IT companies, on par with Infosys and TCS.

A related company, Wipro Enterprises, was spun off in 2013 that owns several consumer products brands in both India and across the world, especially in the Philippines (Splash Corporation) and Malaysia (Wipro Unza).
