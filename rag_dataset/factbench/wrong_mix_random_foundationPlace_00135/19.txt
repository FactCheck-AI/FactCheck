Global Infrastructure Basel (GIB) Foundation is a Swiss foundation based in Basel working to promote sustainable and resilient infrastructure through sustainable infrastructure design and financing on a global scale. GIB has the vision that infrastructure – be it an energy plant, a transit infrastructure or a water utility – should not only deliver its service efficiently but also in a way that helps towards tackling the world’s largest sustainability challenges stemming from population growth, rapid urbanisation, social inequalities, excessive use of finite resources and carbon-intensive lifestyles.
