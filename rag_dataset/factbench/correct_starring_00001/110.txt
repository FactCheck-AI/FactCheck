One of the last films made by David Carradine, star of the Kill Bill movies and 1970s martial arts TV series Kung Fu, has been honoured at Raindance, London's annual festival of independent film-making.

My Suicide, David Lee Miller's "coming-of-age romantic dramedy" about a high-school student who plans to kill himself on camera for his final video class project, shared the prize for best international feature. It features Carradine, who died in June, as a poet and underground film-maker whose work inspires the boy.

The film shared its prize with Patxi Amezcua's Barcelona-set underworld thriller 25 Kilates.

Among the other awards presented on Sunday were the best UK feature prize, which went to Down Terrace, a comedy drama about a family of petty gangsters by British director Ben Wheatley, while best documentary went to director Tokachi Tsuchiya's A Normal Life Please, about challenging labour regulations in Japan.

Judges also handed Colin, the Cannes-acclaimed zombie film made for just Â£45 on a camcorder, the prize for best microbudget feature.
