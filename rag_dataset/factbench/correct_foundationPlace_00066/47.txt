Step-by-Step Application Process for International Students

Eligibility Check: Ensure you meet the program’s requirements. You must be in your penultimate year of study and available for full-time work from November 2024 to February 2025. Xero welcomes international students with the right to work full-time in the host country either upon graduation or who already possess this right.

Prepare Your Application: Gather all necessary documents, including your CV and any relevant work permits or visa documentation that proves your eligibility to work in the chosen country. Highlight your academic achievements, any previous work experience, and specifically mention your interest in Xero and the tech industry.

Online Assessments: Once your eligibility is confirmed, you’ll be invited to complete online assessments. These may include cognitive, behavioral, and technical tests (such as a HackerRank test for engineering roles) to gauge your skills and suitability for the program.

Video Interview: Successful candidates will then proceed to a pre-recorded video interview. This is your chance to shine and show the Xero team why you’re the perfect fit for their internship program.

Virtual Grad Day: The final stage of the application process is a half-day virtual event. Here, you’ll engage in various activities, learn more about Xero, and have the opportunity to ask questions about the internship and the company culture.
