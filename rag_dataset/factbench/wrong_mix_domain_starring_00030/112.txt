Actor Wilmer Valderrama is back for Season 2 of the El Rey Network's “From Dusk Till Dawn,” and joining him for a cameo is his girlfriend Demi Lovato!

“Extra's” Mario Lopez caught up with Wilmer at Universal Studios Hollywood to learn more.

Wilmer revealed that the new season of “From Dusk Till Dawn” will be darker. “It's a lot more twisted. It's a lot more dangerous… this is kind of an official sequel to the movie. Now, you get to really get to see where they all went.”

Demi joined him on the set in Austin, Texas to play a character that Robert Rodriguez created just for her. “She came to play with us, it was really cool. I can't tell you anything. It's very unpredictable how she comes about. It gets very unpredictable in the season and it's at a pivotal part of the show's story line. Its actually a very important character.”

Wilmer said working with her was great. “We're so busy all the time… so for her to spend more than a week, week-and-a-half there, was really great. Going to work together was hilarious. Getting up in the morning, going to work together, it was pretty funny… to share each other's talent on screen, to be able to have that as a memory, it's kind of fun.”

Off screen, the couple is in a good place. “I mean, we've been in each other's lives for many years. I was very blessed and fortunate. I was there at the right time and the right place to love her when she needed me… we've gotten through a lot of stuff, and the journey's been long and a personal one to both of us. The future is, you know, unseen and unpredictable.”

The future is perhaps “unseen and unpredictable,” but could it include a proposal? Demi has said that if he proposed to her she would say yes. Valderrama said with a laugh, “She's writing the future.” He continued, “I really think she's someone... that I hope… that it fits in our future. I mean, I'd be more than down. I love her so much.”
