The Miscellaneous letters and memoranda and Irish papers series are arranged by subject, based partly on an arrangement made while the papers were in the hands of the executors. Each group of papers is placed according to the date of the earliest document in it. Note that these are also letters in the miscellaneous correspondence (MSS. Asquith 9-18) relating in part to the subjects in the Miscellaneous letters and memoranda and Irish papers series.
