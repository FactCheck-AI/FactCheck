We haven’t set eyes on Rick Moranis on the big screen for a number of years but he could be about to come out of his own exile. The ‘Honey, I Shrunk The Kids’ actor is reportedly in talks to join the cast of its follow-up, ‘Shrunk’.

Moranis would return to the character of scientist Wayne Szalinski. He would be starring opposite Josh Gad who has been cast as his grown-up son, Nick who follows in his father’s footsteps by not only becoming a scientist but also accidentally shrinking his own children.

In the original 1989 film, Moranis plays Wayne Szalinski, a scientist and father who accidentally shrinks his teenage son and daughter, along with the two brothers from next door, to just a quarter of an inch in size. When they are thrown out with the trash, the four kids must travel through their backyard to return home while fending off insects, lawnmowers and other obstacles.

Josh Gad pitched the idea of the follow-up to Disney, who lapped up the chance for a bit of nostalgia.

David Hoberman and Todd Lieberman are producing through their Mandeville Films and Television banner, with Todd Rosenberg penning the script. The film’s original director Joe Johnston is also currently in talks to take the helm.

Disney has met with other directors but felt bringing Johnston back was a perfect fit for all involved.

Initially, Disney had toyed with the idea of reviving the franchise for its streaming service Disney + but after the initial excitement from the big-wigs at the company are now looking to release the film theatrically.
