Hey

I live in Canada & know very little about resources for genealogy in the USA.

I decided to try doing Shaquille O'Neal's genealogy.

So far I got this but without any dates so proof is needed.

Shaquille O'Neal born in Newark, New Jersey March 6 1972

Lucille O'Neal & Joseph/Joe Toney (unwed)

Odessa Chambers & Sirlester O'Neal wed possibly Dublin, Laurens, Georgia

Scillar Wright & Hilton O'Neal wed possibly in New Jersey or Georgia

George O'Neal wed Sarah ? likely in Laurens County, Georgia.

I found via much digging online Sarah could be a Dorsey or Dawson but that's ONLY a guess & I'm not good at guessing.

Anyone finding me dates or proof I'm on the right track just jump right in.

Like I said outside of asking Shaq or Lucille to name their ancestors I am stuck.

I should stick to Canadian genealogy.

I read online this line leads to the O'Neal Plantation in Laurens Georgia & freed slaves but again people can say anything online.

Thanks for any help.
