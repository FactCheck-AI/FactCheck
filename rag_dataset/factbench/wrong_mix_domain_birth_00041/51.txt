Born on March 6, 1972, Shaquille Rashaun O’ Neal came from Newark, New Jersey. He is considered as one of the most dominant players in NBA history. He retired from professional basketball in 2011, but remained as an on-screen league analyst. He helped his teams to win NBA championships and Olympic gold. During his early years, he studied at Cole High School and Louisiana State University.

In 1991, he was named as “College Player of the Year.” His first team in NBA was Orlando Magic. He finished in Top 10 in scoring, blocks, shooting and rebounding percentage. Since he is known to be a bad free-throw shooter, he focused on his slam dunks. He became “Player of the Week” during his first week on NBA. He also signed the biggest contract in NBA history for $120 million to Los Angeles Lakers.
