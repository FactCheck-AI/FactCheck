The former Japanese Prime Minister, Keizo Obuchi, has died in hospital in Tokyo, six weeks after suffering a stroke which left him in a coma.

He was sixty-two.

Mr Obuchi took office in July 1998, when the country was in a deep financial crisis.

In his first year, he won praise for pushing economic reforms through parliament.

However, a BBC correspondent says he tried to spend Japan out of recession, leaving the country with a huge national debt.

Mr Obuchi was known as "Mr Ordinary", and our correspondent says it was this common touch that set him apart from other Japanese politicians. Mr Obuchi also tried to use his informal touch to improve Japan?s profile overseas.

For example, he pitched the opening ball at a baseball game when he visited the United States in 1999. Our correspondent says it's thought his hectic work schedule may have contributed to his illness and death.
