The New Yorker, November 5, 1979 P. 43

Talk story about a young greengrocer, a Greek, who is thrilled that poet Odysseus Elytis has won the Nobel Prize for Literature. He is the second Greek Nobel Poet; George Seferis was the first. The young man believes that Yannis Ritsos will be the third. He quotes the other two, and Ritsos. From Seferis he recites: "Wherever I travel, Greece still wounds me."
