I started reading Wizard, by John Varley. Unfortunately, about 2 chapters in, I suddenly realized that it’s the second in a trilogy – the Gaea Trilogy. The first book is Titan, and the third is Demon.

I’ve set this aside for the moment, and am now reading The Name Of the Wind. I’ll get back to Gaea soon. ish.
