Biographical Information

Sir Anerood Jugnauth founded the Militant Socialist Movement (MSM) party in 1983. He was elected as the Prime Minister in 1982 for the first time, again in 1983, and for the third time from 1991 to 1995. His years as Prime Minister were marked with social tension, due to continuous hostility of the then-government towards the Muslim community . He was promoted to the rank of Knight by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II in 1980. He is also honoured with Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards for his continued support for Indias causes and concerns, and for strengthening Indias relationship with Mauritius. He has been a torch-bearer of democratic aspirations in Mauritius. He expressed his country's readiness to establish strong economic ties, particularly in creating technology-based projects with high economic feasibility. Jugnauth is credited with the legacy of Mauritius "economic miracle" of the 1980s - a set of liberal policies such as the creation of a duty-free trade zone and establishing Mauritius as a leader in textiles production - which allowed the island to develop into an economic powerhouse in the region. His regin was also marked with controversy and social tensions between various ethnics groups.

In 2003, he handed the leadership of his party to his son Pravind Jugnauth. He announced that "he had reached the end of this road." Anerood Jugnauth's announcement marked the end of a colourful chapter in Mauritian politics. In an island dominated by political families, the current Prime Minister and former leader of the opposition Dr Navin Ramgoolam is the son of the first post-colonial Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagar Ramgoolam.
