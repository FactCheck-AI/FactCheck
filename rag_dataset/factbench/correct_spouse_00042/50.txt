Byline: STEPHEN MOYES

THE distraught ex-lover of EastEnders star Steve McFadden hugs their baby daughter as she walks around a park in a daze yesterday.

Friends of Dr Rachel Sidwell, 38, said they are worried about her health after her break-up with Steve, 50, who plays Phil Mitchell. They revealed her weight has plummeted and she keeps bursting into tears as she struggles to cope with the stress of bringing up twomonth-old Amelie Tinkerbell alone.

One friend said: "Rachel's doing the best she can in the circumstances but she gave up her husband, children and a contented and fulfilling life to be with Steve.

"It was a case of love at first sight when she met Steve. But it all turned sour very quickly. Rachel is a different person now.

"She cries all day and feels lost and unloved. It's tragic to see her so sad."

Rachel left her surgeon husband and three children after meeting Steve on the school run last year.

They moved in together in Highgate, North London, and Rachel soon discovered she was pregnant.

But shortly after Amelie was born Rachel moved back in with her husband.
