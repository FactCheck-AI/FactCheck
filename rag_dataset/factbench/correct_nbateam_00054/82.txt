The Golden State Warriors have waived guard Shaun Livingston, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.

Livingston, 33, was a key reserve in each of the Warriors' five straight runs to the Finals, winning three championships in that span. Only $2 million of his $7.7 million for next season is guaranteed.

Per Wojnarowski, Livingston intends to continue his career.

His production dwindled in limited action this past season, when Livingston averaged 4.0 points in 64 games. He was originally drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick in 2004, but a gruesome leg injury cost him much of his explosiveness.

Livingston reinvented himself as the consummate team-first player who could run the offense and post up smaller guards.

He also spent time with the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Washington Wizards, Milwaukee Bucks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat before settling in with the Warriors.
