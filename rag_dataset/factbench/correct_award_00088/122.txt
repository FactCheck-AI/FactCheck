1928 Nobel Prize winner Sigrid Undset is the only Norwegian woman to have been awarded the prestigious prize for literature. Her medieval novels, which follow the lives of common people in the Middle ages in Norway, and her later works that deal with contemporary and social issues, were well received in the United States. Kristin Lavransdatter became a best seller, earning a position in the Book of the Month Club-a remarkable feat for a work that centers on a small country in the Middle Ages.

There is no biography in English on Sigrid Undset, which makes this annotated bibliography so important. In one chapter, Maman has created a guide to the autobiographical information in Undset's own works. Much of the literature which is included in the bibliography has never before been put together in this kind of format. American reviews of the author's books, grouped by style of novel, internet resources, dissertations, as well as recent studies in Norwegian, comprise this comprehensive look at one of Norway's most important authors. Ideal for English-speaking researchers.

As a reference work on Undset's writings prior to Nunnally's translations, Maman's bibliography can be highly recommended.

The author has clearly made the bibliography a labour of love, and it is fortunate for those of us in the academic community that she has done so.
