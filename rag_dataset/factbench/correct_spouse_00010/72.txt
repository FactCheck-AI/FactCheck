After a year-and-a-half secret marriage, actress Emmy Rossum and record company executive Justin Siegel have filed for a divorce.

The pair split back in August and after some digging, E! News uncovered the secret news that they were married. In an effort to hide the details of the union, they reportedly paid extra money to keep any notice of their vows from becoming part of the public record.

In the divorce petition filed by Siegel, the reason for the split was irreconcilable differences and showed a wedding date of February 17, 2008. Justin has asked the court to have Emmy pay his legal fees and spousal support.
