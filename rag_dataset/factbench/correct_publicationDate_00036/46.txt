Jewish Science Fiction and Fantasy? Yes! Wandering Stars is the landmark collection of Jewish science fiction and fantasy. The first of its kind, it is an established and enduring classic.

Wandering Stars is a showpiece of Jewish wit, culture, and lore, of the blend of humor and sadness, cynicism, and faith. In these pages you'll find superlative tales of fantasy and science fiction by masters. | Wandering Stars by Jack Dann, Hardcover | Indigo Chapters
