The Los Angeles Lakers continue to take steps towards next season. A few days ago the hiring of Darvin Ham as head coach became official. And, recently, an old colleague joined as an assistant, Shams Charania reported.

Rasheed Wallace, a four-time All-Star and NBA champion with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, will team up with Ham, with whom he previously shared a locker room.

Wallace was an assistant coach for the NCAA's Memphis Tigers, who were led by Penny Hardaway, another former NBA star. Wallace was close to joining the Los Angeles Lakers, according to the former Orlando Magic player.

His presence on the Lakers' bench will bring experience, closeness, and leadership to the team. Since the turn of the century, Wallace has been one of the best power forwards in the league.

He was selected with the fourth overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft by the Washington Bullets, and he went on to have a successful career with the Portland Trail Blazers and Atlanta Hawks before joining the Michigan franchise.

His character is closely related to his figure as a player in the NBA, in addition to being an outstanding player for his claw and good shot release.

A striking personality

With 41 technical fouls in a season, Wallace holds the record for most technical fouls received by a player. He's also the player with the most career wins, with 371.

Now, his arrival will benefit a team that did not make the playoffs this season. The Los Angeles Lakers lost in the play-in round and were unable to compete for the championship.
