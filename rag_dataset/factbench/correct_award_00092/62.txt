Biography: Gabriela Mistral, a pseudonym for Lucila Godoy y Alcayaga, became the first Latin American to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for her poetry in 1945.

Born into a humble background in rural Chile, she first rose to prominence in 1914 with her collection “Sonetos de la muerte” (“Sonnets of Death”) for which won she a literary prize. Desolación (“Desolation”), a collection of her early works was published in 1922. Other major volumes include Ternura (“Tenderness”) 1924, and Tala (“Destruction”) in 1938.
