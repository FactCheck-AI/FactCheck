Explore Pacific and Central Valley history, sponsored by the University Library.

The Digital Humanities Summer Fellowships bring together students and faculty from a variety of disciplines to create technology-enhanced, public-facing humanities projects. Spend five weeks in an intense and fast-paced but fun experience that will challenge you to develop new skills and collaborate across fields of study. This summer the fellowships consist of two separate projects related by the topic of forced Japanese American relocation and its impact on communities at Pacific and the Central Valley. Applicants are invited to select either offering.

The two projects will be conducted in person, full-time 40 hour work-weeks, and run concurrently during Summer Session III, from July 25 – August 26. All participants will have access to the library’s array of research and technology resources and integrated support from multiple faculty and subject area experts. All undergraduates from any major or program are eligible.
