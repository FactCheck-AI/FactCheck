Ann Crady Weiss is helping millions of families get better sleep with her company Hatch. Hatch launched in 2016 as a baby-product company, and today, one in three households with a baby has a Hatch Rest, which acts as a soothing sound machine and night light. The brand has since expanded to focus on helping people of all ages prioritize their sleep. Its Hatch Restore, a sleep device made with adults in mind, was even mentioned on Time’s 100 Best Inventions of 2020. But Hatch wasn’t Ann’s first entrepreneurial endeavor. In fact, she gained knowledge in the baby space with her first company, Maya’s Mom, an early social networking site for parents. Before that, Ann led as the director of new initiatives at Yahoo Autos and practiced as a corporate securities attorney.
