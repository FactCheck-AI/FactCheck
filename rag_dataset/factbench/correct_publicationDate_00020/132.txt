From the author of VOYAGES BY STARLIGHT and THE GREAT WHEEL. Sounds a bit like Blaylock meets Mieville. That means good. â€œIn a bleak and gritty England, in a fantastical Age of Industry, the wealth that comes from magic is both revered and reviled. Here, an ambitious young man is haunted by his childhood love - a woman determined to be a part of the world he despises.: Aether mines, magical and dangerous substances, the source of all power, dilapidated manors, magic, unexplained deaths, revolutionaries and other interesting concepts and features. #17936
