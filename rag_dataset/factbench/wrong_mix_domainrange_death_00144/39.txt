HOLLYWOOD, CA â€“ Bob Marley's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized, and it will cost $3,000 to repair it. The vandalism was discovered Monday, according to Ana Martinez of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.

The star appears to have been pounded on by something heavy like a sledgehammer, totally destroying it, Martinez said.

"This is considered vandalism to a State Historic Landmark," she said. "It will be repaired by the Hollywood Historic Trust and will cost nearly $3,000 to repair it."

Martinez tweeted a photo of the damaged star, along with the message: "Why would anyone do this to Bob Marley's star? Help me understand. The Walk of Fame is a State registered Historic landmark! Disrespectful."

The reggae artist died in 1981. He was posthumously awarded the star, located at 7080 Hollywood Blvd., in 2001.
