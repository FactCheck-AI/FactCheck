The New Orleans Hornets orchestrated a major trade with the Washington Wizards on Wednesday, sending Emeka Okafor and Trevor Ariza to Washington D.C. in exchange for Rashard Lewis and the No. 46 in the upcoming 2012 NBA Draft.

The move gives the Hornets even more cap space in what should be an eventful draft. They now own the No. 1, No. 10, No. 34 and No. 46 picks. The Wizards, in return, get some much-needed help for their front court. Okafor averaged just under 10 points and eight rebounds in 28.9 minutes per game last season. Ariza averaged 10.8 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists in 32.9 minutes per game.
