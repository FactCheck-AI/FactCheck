Ali Landry has revealed that she did not have sex with her husband Alejandro Monteverde until after they were married.

Landry, who has two children with Monteverde, explained that she was cautious because of her previous wedding to Mario Lopez.

Lopez and Landry married in 2004 but split two weeks later when Landry discovered that her new husband had cheated on her.

Speaking on The Wendy Williams Show, Landry said: "That was probably the most dramatic thing to happen to me in my life, and granted it was absolutely horrible. And now I have a great husband and children."

However, Landry - who said that she is "very grateful" for the experience now that she is married - explained that she was more careful when she entered her relationship with Monteverde.

"Because I think of the situation I was in before, I was just treading lightly and did not want to make any mistakes in this relationship," she said. "So we did not [have sex]. We abstained from having sex until we got married."
