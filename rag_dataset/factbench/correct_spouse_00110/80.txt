Length of marriage: 18 days

Baby-faced Saved by the Bell star Mario Lopez married model and actress Ali Landry in April 2004, but the marriage ended before the honeymoon could even begin. The couple annulled their union after only two weeks, when Landry discovered that Lopez had been unfaithful throughout their nearly six-year courtship. Both have since moved on and have children with their respective partners.
