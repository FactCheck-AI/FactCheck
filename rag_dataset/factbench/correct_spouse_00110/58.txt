Ali Landry trashed her marriage to ex-husband Mario Lopez in a new interview with Lacey Leone McLaughlin, claiming that the actor started regularly cheating on her just days after their wedding in a way she can only compare to that of a “Tiger Woods situation.”

According to Landry’s interview with McLaughlin on the newest episode of the latter’s podcast titled Unfolding Leadership, the 48-year-old model and former Miss USA opens up to the Hollywood executive coach about her marriage to Lopez, his serial cheating, and why there are reasons she is ultimately thankful she found out her former husband was cheating on her while they were still together.
