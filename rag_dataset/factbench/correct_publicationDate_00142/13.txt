Edward was a successful poet, playwright and novelist with an impressive political career, serving twice in Parliament and going on to the House of Lords as Baron Lytton. Edward’s novels are the source of phrases including ‘the great unwashed’; ‘pursuit of the almighty dollar’; ‘the pen is mightier than the sword’.

Unfortunately, his name lives on in The Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest for the worst beginning to a novel, inspired by Edward’s ‘Paul Clifford’ (1830): ‘It was a dark and stormy night’. Edward had an in-depth knowledge of the occult. One of his most popular excursions into the occult was ‘Vril, the Power of the Coming Race’ (1871) which contributed to the birth of the science fiction genre. The word ‘Vril’ came to be associated with ‘life-giving elixirs’. In 1886 John L Johnston was looking for a name for his ‘liquid life’ beef extract drink. He chose a blend of the words Bovine and Vril, and named the new beefy beverage ‘Bovril’.

Edward died at his Torquay home Argyll Hall on Warren Road, having lived there since 1867. Built in 1849, Argyll Hall became the Roseland Hotel and is now an apartment block called Marine Palms. The house occupies a prominent position here on Rock Walk and can be seen as you head towards the harbourside from the Paignton direction.
