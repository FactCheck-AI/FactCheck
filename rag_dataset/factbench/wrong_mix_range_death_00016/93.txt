Gun violence among rappers is nothing new. The latest shooting of Punjabi rapper-singer turned politician Sidhu Moose Wala is only a testimony to the fact that the hip-hop community at large has had a long history where artistes have been murdered in broad daylight.

The first-ever hip-hop artist to be murdered is believed to be Scott La Rock in 1987, who was a founding member of the East Coast hip-hop group Boogie Down Productions. Last year, at least 20 rappers were shot dead. Some of them were internationally acclaimed artistes.
