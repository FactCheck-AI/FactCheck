History[]

The first occupants of Palo Alto area were the native Ohlone. The expedition of Don Gaspar de Portol√° explored the area and camped at El Palo Alto (the tall stick) in 1769. The community of Mayfield was established near the site in 1853, starting with a roadhouse built by James Otterson on the route between San Francisco and San Jose. After a railroad connected Mayfield to San Francisco in 1863, industrialist Leland Stanford established Palo Alto Stock Farm nearby at San Francisquito Creek to breed racehorses. In 1885, Stanford established Stanford University in the memory of his son who died in the previous year. The university was opened to students in 1891. The town that formed by the university was first named University Park, and renamed to Palo Alto, which was incorporated in 1894. Palo Alto grew to be larger than Mayfield and annexed it in 1925.[3]

Hewlett-Packard (HP) was founded in 1939 by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and David Packard in a one-car garage in Palo Alto. The "HP Garage" is now designated an official California Historical Landmark and is marked with a plaque calling it the "Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'".[4] The Palo Alto Research Center was established in 1970 by Xerox and created many technologies that inspired the Apple Lisa and Macintosh.[5] As of 2014, Stanford University next to Palo Alto has the second most number of alumni working at Apple Inc.[6]
