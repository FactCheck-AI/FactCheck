Ananta Creative Group is a Princeton-based marketing and public relations collaboration among writers, visual artists, digital marketing specialists and social media experts. We have evolved over the past 10 years from a few friends working on side projects together to a full-service, well-respected marketing team specializing in logo design, brand messaging, content marketing, website design and digital marketing strategies.

Our location in the heart of Princeton, NJ, provides us with intellectual and creative inspiration every day. We love what we do. We have fun doing it. And we produce consistently excellent work with measurable results.
