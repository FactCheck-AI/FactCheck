Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan says the reason he has had unsuccessful movies in the past few years is because he has not been able to tell good stories through his movies.

He was last seen in Zero in 2018 and Jab Harry Met Sejal in 2017.

Both movies failed at the box office and were not able to impress the audience.

When asked about what he wants his legacy to be, Khan says he wants to pass the culture of immense hardwork with a lot of humour.

Meanwhile, Khan has not formally announced his next venture but if rumours are to be believed, he is working on a movie directed by Raj Kumar Hirani who has directed movies such as 3 Idiots and PK.
