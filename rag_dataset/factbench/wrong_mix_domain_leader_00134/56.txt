Dear Prime Minister's Office,

Under the Freedom of Information Act, I would like to request every letter exchanged between Harold Wilson and Levi Eshkol in May and June 1967. I know that an exchange of letters between them took place during that period, because a telegram from the US State Department to the US Embassy in the UK dated from May 21, 1967 (Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964â€“1968, Volume XIX, Arab-Israeli Crisis and War, 1967, Document 29) refers to it.

Yours faithfully,

Philippe Lemoine

Dear Prime Minister's Office,

Please pass this on to the person who conducts Freedom of Information reviews.

I am writing to request an internal review of Prime Minister's Office's handling of my FOI request 'Exchange of letters between Harold Wilson and Levi Eshkol during the May-June 1967 crisis'.

In your response to my request, you told me that the correspondence between Harold Wilson and Levi Eshkol I had asked was not held by the Prime Minister's Office and that I should check The National Archives instead. However, I had already searched for that information at The National Archives before filing a FOIA request with the Prime Minister's Office, but had been unable to locate it. Yet I know that Messrs. Wilson and Eshkol exchanged letters during that period, since that correspondence is mentioned explicitly in the US archives (see my initial request for the exact reference), so it has to exist somewhere.

A full history of my FOI request and all correspondence is available on the Internet at this address: https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/e...

Yours faithfully,

Philippe Lemoine
