the only tennis player in the open era to have won every Grand Slam singles title, to have won the Tennis Masters Cup, to have been part of the Davis Cup winning team, and to have won an Olympic gold medal

Andre Kirk Agassi was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, on April 29, 1970. His father was a member of the Iranian boxing team at the 1948 and 1952 Olympic Games before immigrating to the United States. He honed Andre's hand-eye coordination by hanging tennis balls above his crib, and gave him paddles and balloons when he was still in a high chair. When he was five years old Andre was already practicing with such pros as Jimmy Connors and Roscoe Tanner. At the age of 14, Andre was sent to Nick Bollettieri's Tennis Academy in Florida. He turned professional at the age of 16, and won his first top-level singles title in 1987, at Itaparica. He won six more tournaments in 1988, and, by December of that year, had accumulated more than $2 million in prize money -- the fastest rise through the professional ranks in tennis history.

By the time he ended his career, Agassi had become one of only five players in the world to have won all four Grand Slam singles events during his career. He is the only player in the open era to have won every Grand Slam singles title, to have won the Tennis Masters Cup, to have been part of the Davis Cup winning team (1990, 1992, and 1995), and to have won an Olympic gold medal. He is also the only male tennis player to have been ranked in the Top 10 in three different decades.
