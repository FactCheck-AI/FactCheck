Kenzaburo Oe, a Japanese writer whose brain-damaged son became a primary symbol in his novels about a nation haunted by World War II, won the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday.

Oe, 59, whose works have been strongly influenced by Western literature, invented a vivid, almost assaultive writing style, a far departure from traditional Japanese literary expression.Among his most important works was the 1967 novel "The Silent Cry," which deals with people's relationship in a world where "knowledge, passions, dreams, ambitions and attitudes merge into each other," the Swedish Academy said in its announcement.

Kenzaburo Oe (pronounced Ken-za-boo-roh OH-eh) is the second Japanese writer to win the Nobel literature prize. In 1968, the academy honored Yasunari Kawabata.

Oe said Thursday that he was heavily influenced by authors like the playwright and novelist Kobo Abe and novelist Masuji Ibuse, both of whom died last year.

"It was thanks to what these modern novelists have built up . . . that I was able to win while I was still alive," he said.

But the academy noted that his work has been strongly influenced by western writers, including Dante, Poe, Rabelais, Balzac, Eliot and even Sartre.

Oe came of age during the American occupation, and his works are haunted by Japan's defeat during World War II.

"The humiliation took a firm grip on him and has colored much of his work. He himself describes his writing as a way of exorcising demons," the academy

said. At first a leftwing critic of postwar Japan, he changed when his first son, Hikari, was born 31 years ago with brain damage. Oe's best-known novel was published a year later, in 1964.
