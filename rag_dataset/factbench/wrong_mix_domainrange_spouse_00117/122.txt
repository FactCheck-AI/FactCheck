The entertainment world is celebrating a strong version that points to the alleged marriage between TV celebrity Kourtney Kardashian and punk rock drummer Travis Barker.

Total discretion

According to information released by the site TMZ, after attending together the 64th edition of the Grammy Awards, the couple chose to go to a chapel located in Las Vegas, Nevada, where around 2 am hired an Elvis Presley impersonator to officiate the ceremony.

It was reported that both Kardashian, 42, and Barker, 46, did not allow any of the people working at the venue to take evidence of their presence and therefore restricted the use of cameras, video cameras and even cell phones, all with the aim that later any image could fall into the hands of the media.

However, the moment in which the couple swore "eternal" love to each other was recorded by the lens of their own photographer, who was expressly hired with the clause of handing over even the memory of his digital camera in order to have full control of the images.

Waiting for more surprises

Another point to note is that the couple left open the possibility of renewing their vows through other marriage rites that will take place later.

It is worth mentioning that Kourtney and Travis formalized their love relationship after almost a year of dating as friends and in October 2021 after taking a walk on the beach they chose to get engaged at the Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel, where the drummer paid to set up a space decorated with red roses and white candles that gave a romantic touch to the scene.

Although the "Keeping Up With the Kardashians" alum is already the mother of three children from her relationship with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, this is the first time she is getting married.

As for Travis, this is the third time he has walked down the aisle, having previously married Melissa Kennedy as well as Shanna Moakler, with whom he had two children.
