Topspin was conceived as a network-based âcontent engineâ, but when Krish Ramakrishnan joined as CEO he quickly pivoted the company towards an emerging need in scale-out server infrastructure: I/O virtualization. The company was one of the first to leverage VMwareâs early server virtualization technologies and became the clear leader in its nascent category. HP, IBM, Dell, NEC, NetApp and others all OEMâd the Topspin system. Cisco acquired Topspin in 2005. Krish has since gone on to found BlueJeans Network.
