I'll have to confess that I read Neuromancer only a couple of years ago, and at the time, didn't understand what all the fuss was about. It was a book about computers, written before computers were really a thing. The strange thing about William Gibson's fantastic novel is it's staying power and how it's positively brimming with fresh ideas in a genre gone stale by the early 1980s. Going back to re-read Gibson's works (especially in Burning Chrome), I'm shocked at how vibrant and raw his writing is.

Neuromancer is one of the more important books to enter the genre, and as it celebrates its third decade in print, it's an interesting one to go back and look upon and to understand just how revolutionary the title was at the time.

Go read 30 Years of William Gibson's Neuromancer over on Kirkus Reviews.
