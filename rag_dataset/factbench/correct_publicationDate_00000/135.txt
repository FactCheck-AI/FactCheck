"One of the classic presentations of the womb-city, metropolis as mother, which has haunted imaginations ever since... The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun are the best books Isaac Asimov ever wrote" (The Guardian). In 2004 The Caves of Steel was nominated for a retroactive Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954. A television adaptation was made by the BBC and shown in 1964: only a few short excerpts still exist. In 1989, the book was adapted by Bert Coules as a radio play for the BBC, with Ed Bishop as Elijah Baley and Sam Dastor as R. Daneel Olivaw.
