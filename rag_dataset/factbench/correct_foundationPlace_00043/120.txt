The University of Colorado Boulder and Oregon State University have entered the planning stage for a new industry-focused Pervasive Personalized Intelligence center. The center would allow for interdisciplinary and collaborative research on machine-learning based software systems and aid in long-term partnerships between startups, corporations, universities and government agencies. Industry members involved leverage affiliate investment, have direct access to students, and enjoy company savings thanks to low risk and accelerated research and development.

If created, center headquarters would be at Oregon State with a site at CU supporting research under the supervision of the U.S. National Science Foundation using the Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers model.

Interested industry partners and researchers are invited to join the group for a planning workshop in Portland on Oct. 11-12. For more information, visit www.ppicenter.org.
