The eldest son of the late entertainer Ray Charles filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit Tuesday against his father’s long-time manager, claiming the manager conspired to wrongfully deprive him of use of his father’s trademark.

Ray Charles Robinson, Jr., and RCR Productions, Inc., the company he said he co-owns with his sister, Raenee, filed the lawsuit this afternoon in U.S. District Court in downtown Los Angeles.

The lawsuit seeks $10 million in punitive damages for “financial injuries and severe emotional distress.” In it, Robinson claims that Charles’ manager Joe Adams wrongfully coerced him into signing his 40 percent ownership of RCR Productions over to him.

Adams, who managed Ray Charles for more than 40 years and is the trustee of Charles’ estate, did so knowing that Robinson had relapsed into drug problems following his father’s death at the age of 73 in June 2004, the lawsuit claims.

A phone call to Ray Charles Enterprises, of which Adams is the president, was not immediately returned.

RCR Productions is the rightful owner of the name and likeness of Ray Charles, according to the lawsuit. Adams’ goal was to enrich himself by taking control and ownership of the Ray Charles trademark away from Robinson as well as his sister, who owns a 40 percent interest in RCR Productions, the lawsuit said.

The remaining 20 percent belongs to the Robinson Foundation for Hearing Disorders, which was founded after Charles’ death, the lawsuit said.

Also named as defendants in the lawsuit are Adams’ company Joe Adams Productions, Inc., and Valerie Ervin, Charles’ executive assistant for the last 10 years of his life.

In addition to punitive damages, the lawsuit seeks attorneys’ fees and an injunction barring Adams and his co-defendants from using Ray Charles’ image or likeness in connection with the “marketing, distribution or advertising of any product.”
