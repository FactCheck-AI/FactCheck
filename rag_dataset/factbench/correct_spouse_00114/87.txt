Tori Spelling is engaged, just months after separating from her first husband. Actor Dean McDermott, who has been dating the former Beverly Hills 90210 star for several months, proposed on Christmas Eve in Toronto.

In October, Charlie Shanian filed for divorce from Spelling, a little more than a year after they married. McDermott filed for divorce from his wife of 12 years, Mary Jo Eustace, in September. They have one child.
