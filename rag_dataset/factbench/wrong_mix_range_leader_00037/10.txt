FACE MASK FREE MOVEMENT: National capitals around Europe have stepped up their unilateral moves to fight the coronavirus, including by imposing border checks and banning the export of medical gear. Those moves forced the European Commission to ring the alarm on Sunday and follow through with new measures today.

In a video message, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said “it is of utmost importance to keep our internal market going” and announced the Commission had adopted an “export authorization scheme for protective equipment.” The EU export ban would mean things like face masks “can only be exported to non-EU countries with the explicit authorization of the EU governments,” von der Leyen said, adding “national bans on selling protecting equipment to other member states are not good.”

The fine print: The Commission’s new “implementing act” is here — member countries still have to give it their final approval. Bottom line: The plan would allow EU governments to block sales to non-bloc countries but not to each other. The Commission seemed confident this will stop internal EU export bans.

Now read this: “From Beijing to Brussels, from Rome to Washington, London and beyond, politicians haven’t just failed to rise to the occasion, they’ve engaged in a dangerous game of parsing, obfuscation and reality-denial that has cost lives and delayed a resolute response,” writes Matthew Karnitschnig this morning. “After weeks of largely ignoring the unfolding crisis, leaders from France to Austria have been forced by a sudden explosion of cases to impose severe limits on their citizens. Just a week ago, France hosted the largest Smurf convention ever, drawing more than 3,500 visitors. On Saturday, the country’s prime minister announced the closure of all bars, restaurants and non-essential shops.”

CORONA TOUR D’EUROPE

🇩🇪 GERMANY IS THIS MORNING CLOSING ITS BORDERS with France, Austria, Luxembourg, Denmark and Switzerland (except for commuters and goods transporters). The government is also drafting a third version of its export ban on personal protective equipment, it said on Saturday, following EU threats to launch infringement procedures.

Making America Great Again (by buying German): German government officials on Sunday confirmed a Die Welt report that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration offered “large sums of money” to get exclusive access to a coronavirus vaccine being developed by German biopharmaceutical company CureVac. German officials will discuss the matter in crisis meetings today, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer told the Washington Post. Dietmar Hopp, CureVac’s top shareholder, said the company is not for sale, adding: “If we hopefully manage to find a vaccine, it should reach, protect and help people in the whole world.”

🇫🇷 FRANCE CLOSES BARS AND RESTAURANTS: French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said supermarkets, newsstands and pharmacies will be the only retailers allowed to remain open, while French officials told POLITICO’s Rym Momtaz and Elisa Braun that stricter coronavirus confinement measures are likely if people don’t respond to the government’s social distancing pleas.

Let them eat bread: Baguettes are essential so bakeries remain open for now, the Confédération Boulangerie Pâtisserie tweeted.

🇪🇸 SPAIN LOCKDOWN: Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez addressed the nation on Saturday evening to announce people could only leave their homes to buy groceries and pharmaceutical products, go to the bank or hospital, or to take care of dependents.

🇳🇱 DUTCH PM MARK RUTTE WILL GIVE A RARE NATIONAL ADDRESS this evening, Eline Schaart reports. Joop den Uyl delivered the last formal address by a Dutch PM during the oil crisis in 1973. The government also called on schools and childcare centers, bars, restaurants and sport clubs to close from today.

🇵🇹 PORTUGAL AND SPAIN TO PROPOSE NEW RULES TODAY to limit transit across their common border, Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa announced. He said that while trade and cross-border commuters will be allowed to pass, all others would have to justify their trips, and tourists will be turned away.

🇪🇪 ESTONIA IS INTRODUCING BORDER CONTROLS on Tuesday, the government said. Anyone entering the country from March 17 must spend two weeks self-quarantining.

🇨🇿 THE CZECH REPUBLIC has banned people from moving around except for work, shopping and some other limited activities until March 24.

🇸🇮 SLOVENIA will shut down its air traffic from Tuesday.

🇦🇹 AUSTRIA’S CHANCELLOR Sebastian Kurz announced major restrictions on movement in public places on Sunday, banning gatherings of more than five people and putting further limits on who can enter the country.

🇬🇧 THE UK GOVERNMENT, meanwhile, is increasingly under pressure for holding back on more hardline measures, as the number of people infected in Britain rose to over 1,300 on Sunday, with the death toll at 35. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced America had extended its European travel ban to the U.K. and Ireland, effective from this morning.

🇧🇪 CAN CORONAVIRUS CHANGE BELGIAN POLITICS? Belgian political parties met repeatedly over the weekend to discuss forming an emergency government to fight the health crisis. The caretaker government, headed by Prime Minister Sophie Wilmès, received emergency powers on Sunday to tackle coronavirus, and a number of parties agreed to support the administration as a minority government for up to six months. Ten parties, including the three in government, are expected to back the plan in parliament this week, Reuters reports.

Let them eat frites: Belgian Health Minister Maggie De Block announced that Belgian fritures will remain open. “We can’t all starve,” De Block said.

🇺🇸 MEANWHILE, IN THE US: Illinois, Ohio and California announced closures of bars and restaurants, New York state forced the closure of schools in New York City, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance Sunday night recommending the cancellation or postponement of events with 50 or more people throughout the U.S. for the next eight weeks. Our Stateside colleagues have the latest.

🇨🇳 CORONA CHARM OFFENSIVE — GEOPOLITICS OF A PANDEMIC: Beijing, meanwhile, claims it has its corona crisis under control, and is reaching out to other countries to offer help. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is shipping 500,000 masks and other medical gear to Liège, local public broadcaster VRT reported, and a plane loaded with Chinese medical staff and aid arrived in Italy over the weekend. According to Philippe Le Corre, senior researcher on China at the Harvard Kennedy School, Beijing’s aid efforts in Italy and across Europe are aimed at repairing its “very badly damaged” image abroad. But, Le Corre said, “The reality is that it’s going to be very difficult for China to restore its image as a country that helps the world.”

COULD CORONA BREAK THE EU? Dalibor Rohac from the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C. argues in an op-ed on POLITICO that the pandemic has created an economic shock on a scale that could exceed the 2008 financial crisis.

BUT NOW FOR SOME GOOD NEWS: Islamic terrorist group ISIS in its latest al-Naba newsletter advised members to “stay away from the land of the epidemic,” i.e. Europe, the Sunday Times reports.

LOCKED DOWN IN THE BUBBLE

NO PLACE LIKE THE HOME OFFICE: Life in Brussels’ Quartier Européen has ground to a halt, with EU institutions closed for all but the essential activities. As of this morning, European Commission officials “in non-critical functions” will work from home, while “critical” staff such as Cabinet officials will work in shifts in the Berlaymont. The European Parliament has postponed or canceled all committee meetings, while the Council canceled all but “essential meetings.” It’s like summer recess, but less fun.

There are fears the teleworking regime will strain the EU’s IT systems, in particular those of the 32,000 Commission staffers. A Commission spokesperson assured us things are under control, with IT systems scaled up and “sufficient capacity for all staff with corporate laptops.”

Cybersecurity experts are on high alert: Staffers working from home are more likely to use unprotected networks and devices for official tasks, and hackers are using the coronavirus to lure them into downloading malicious software and hand over access to online accounts. Exhibit A: Hackers are posing as World Health Organization and national health ministry officials.

PSA: The European Cybersecurity Agency ENISA sent some tips for Playbook readers working from home.

LITERATURE FOR A LOCKDOWN: From Boccaccio to Michael Crichton, Paola Tamma and Christian Oliver have some, er, feel-good classics to cheer you up.

IN OTHER NEWS

TURNOUT TANKS IN FRENCH ELECTIONS: The coronavirus pandemic pushed turnout to a record low in French local elections on Sunday, prompting opposition politicians to call on Emmanuel Macron to postpone the second round, scheduled for next Sunday. Full details here.

Paris results: Socialist Mayor Anne Hidalgo won 30.2 percent of the vote in her bid for reelection, ahead of conservative former Justice Minister Rachida Dati on 22 percent, according to an Ipsos/Sopra Steria estimate. Macron’s candidate, former Health Minister Agnès Buzyn, trailed in third place on 17.6 percent.

Winners and losers: The night was grim for Macron’s LREM party, which failed to make headway in major cities. And Marine Le Pen’s National Rally failed to increase its fortunes — there was no far-right wave this time, though the party is set to hold on to the cities it won in 2014. Rym Montaz, Elisa Braun and Laura Kayali have the takeaways.

BREXIT LATEST: Brussels is willing to establish a zero-tariff area for goods with the U.K. but it will impose fines on unfair competitive behavior, according to a draft text for a future relations agreement seen by POLITICO’s trade team. “The text — which came out Friday — crosses several of Britain’s red lines, meaning the talks will likely be tough,” our Trade colleagues report. “The 441-page document — read it here — drafted by the European Commission lays out for the first time in legal text what Brussels wants from the U.K. The EU wants to ‘establish a free trade area in trade in goods’ in which ‘customs duties on goods originating in the other party shall be prohibited.'” Read the full details in this morning’s POLITICO Pro Morning Trade.

Video killed the Brexit-negotiating star: The Brexit talks will no longer be conducted face-to-face because of coronavirus, and trade experts tell Emilio Casalicchio that setting out demands to an opponent on a screen is going to be a problem.

SPAIN’S ROYAL FLUSH: Spain’s royal household announced on Sunday that in order to “preserve the dignity” of the crown, King Felipe VI had renounced the inheritance he was set to receive from his father, emeritus King Juan Carlos I, and canceled the taxpayer-funded allowance allocated to the former monarch. The emeritus king is implicated in a tax evasion scandal in Switzerland, where prosecutors are investigating an €88 million offshore account he operated in the alpine country. According to the Tribune de Genève, Swiss authorities believe the cash came from kickbacks the then-monarch received for setting up business deals between Spanish companies and Saudi Arabia in 2008. King Felipe was implicated in the scandal on Saturday, when the Telegraph reported he was named as the beneficiary of a separate offshore account containing €65 million “gifted” to Juan Carlos I by Saudi Arabia.

ICYMI — ORBAN’S BACK: Romania’s parliament on Saturday backed a second government led by Ludovic Orban. Carmen Paun has more.

ALWAYS A BRIDESMAID, NEVER THE BRIDE: U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden committed Sunday to picking a woman for his vice president if he were to win the party’s nomination. John Harris writes that the former vice president is now bringing together the demographic and ideological blocs of the Democratic Party.

TECH CORNER

HERE FIRST — EUROPE’S INDUSTRY CHIEFS CALL FOR COMPENSATION TO RIP AND REPLACE HUAWEI: The European Round Table for Industry (ERT) is calling on governments that want to exclude Chinese vendors from their 5G networks to compensate for the losses incurred by its clients. More than 50 top executives of industrial giants including Daimler, BASF, Siemens, Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and others backed a new position paper stating that if governments ban Huawei and ZTE, “they should ensure that corresponding costs are compensated through adequate measures, including fiscal measures.”

Governments across the Continent are currently adopting measures for 5G security, following a January deal with EU experts to limit Europe’s reliance on “high-risk suppliers” (read: China’s Huawei and ZTE). But telecom operators have long complained such partial bans would impose high costs when they roll out 5G networks. Today’s joint call is the strongest public signal by industry yet for governments to not only talk about bans, but also cough up some cash.

PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW — BELGIAN DIGITAL MINISTER PHILIPPE DE BACKER: Playbook sat down with Philippe De Backer, Belgium’s caretaker minister of digital affairs, telecom policy and privacy, to talk 5G and AI.

On 5G in Brussels: Belgian regional governments are still deadlocked over the rollout of 5G mobile internet. One unresolved issue is that Brussels has longstanding, record-high restrictions on radiation levels, and local anti-antennae activists argue 5G poses serious health risks. “We don’t want to repeat what happened with 4G,” said De Backer, referring to the EU capital’s horrible mobile internet connection quality. He said the science is clear and there is no sense in holding off the rollout.

Asked if Brussels’ local politicians would agree, De Backer said: “I hope they’re realizing Europe is watching.” He added that a final deal should get a green light in Brussels, “unless of course you say we’ll roll out 5G across Belgium except in Brussels … If Flanders agrees, Wallonia agrees, German speakers agree, but Brussels doesn’t, we could have 5G everywhere except in Brussels.”

On AI: The EU should have pushed through a five-year ban on facial recognition, De Backer said. The Commission floated such a temporary ban on the controversial technology in a draft AI white paper in January, but cut it from the final version. “I was very disappointed that the Commission didn’t stick to such a ban,” De Backer said. “We have to go easy with this technology. It’s such a radical technology that requires you to thoroughly think about how to implement it in public spaces.”
