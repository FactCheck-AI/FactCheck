The Philadelphia 76ers are reportedly pursuing a trade for Cleveland Cavaliers sharpshooter Kyle Korver.

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer's Keith Pompey, the Sixers "have had discussions" with the Cavaliers about a trade centered around Korver and shooting guard Jerryd Bayless.

Citing a source briefed on the talks, the New York Times' Marc Stein reported a deal involving those two is "possible" but "far from certain."

Bayless, who is due $8.6 million next season, has been considered a prime buyout candidate since falling out of the Sixers rotation last season.

Given Bayless' declining value, it stands to reason the Sixers would have to add sweetener in the form of a young prospect or draft picks to complete a deal for a shooter of Korver's caliber.

Last season, the 37-year-old averaged 9.2 points per game and shot 43.6 percent from distance for a Cavaliers team that won a fourth straight Eastern Conference title.
