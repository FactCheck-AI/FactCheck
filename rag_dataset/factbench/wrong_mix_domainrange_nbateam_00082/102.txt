CHARLOTTE, N.C. AP — Shaquille O'Neal celebrated his 34th birthday with 35 points and accounted for all of Miami's scoring in overtime, leading the Heat over the Charlotte Bobcats 106-105 on Monday night.

O'Neal added 12 rebounds to lead the Heat to a season-high ninth consecutive victory. This one was done without leading scorer Dwyane Wade, who sat out with a sprained right wrist.

Jason Williams made three 3s in the final period, including one with 45 seconds to play to tie it at 98. But both teams missed opportunities to win it in regulation. Antoine Walker missed a jumper for Miami, and Primoz Brezec twice missed for Charlotte, including a shot at the final buzzer that didn't even hit the rim.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Mike Bibby scored 23 of his 29 points in the first half and Brad Miller added 21 points for Sacramento.

Bibby was 10-for-16 from the floor and Miller was 9-of-10 for the Kings, who put five players in double figures. Reserve Bonzi Wells had 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Ron Artest and Kenny Thomas each had 11 points. Bibby also dished off for 10 assists.

The 25-point loss was the most lopsided this season at home for the Nets, and the second time they couldn't stop Sacramento's offense. The Kings beat the Nets 114-105 on Nov. 23, the highest point total allowed by New Jersey all season.

Vince Carter led the Nets with 21 points but shot just 8-for-22 from the floor. Richard Jefferson had 18 points and 39-year-old Clifford Robinson added 13 off the bench for New Jersey. Jason Kidd had 10 points and 11 assists.

OKLAHOMA CITY — Boris Diaw had 20 points and 12 rebounds, and Phoenix overcame the loss of Steve Nash to beat New Orleans for its 11th straight win.

Nash, the reigning NBA MVP, sprained his right ankle and left the game with 2:54 remaining in the third quarter and the Suns down by four points. Leandro Barbosa replaced him and helped Phoenix extend the NBA's longest current winning streak.

The Hornets hit only one of 10 shots to start the final period and that allowed the Suns to take control. Barbosa ended the scoring with a layup. He had 10 of his 15 points in the fourth quarter.

Shawn Marion had 19 points and 16 rebounds for his 46th double-double, the most in the NBA. Raja Bell scored 17 points and Nash had 12 points and seven assists before leaving.

David West led New Orleans with 22 points and Paul added 14 points and 11 assists. Kirk Snyder scored all of his 13 points in the first half and Desmond Mason had 11, but only three after halftime.
