Ty Lawson scored a career playoff-high 27 points and fellow speedy point guard Raymond Felton hit four clutch free throws in the final 23 seconds to help Denver beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 104-101 on Monday night as the Nuggets avoided a first-round sweep. "This is the biggest game of my life," Lawson said. (WRAL Sports Fan)
