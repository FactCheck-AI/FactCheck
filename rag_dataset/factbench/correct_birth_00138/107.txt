Kofi Annan was Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1997 through 2006. He succeeded Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt in the post, and was followed by Ban Ki-moon of South Korea. Kofi Annan was a U.N. veteran who took his first job with the organization in 1962 and worked his way up through various posts, including Deputy Director to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (1980-83) and Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping (1995-96). Annan was the first Secretary-General chosen from the ranks of the U.N.'s staff. He was also the first black man to hold the post and the second African (after Boutros-Ghali). In 2001 Annan and the United Nations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their ongoing work in global peace and cooperation. Annan was elected for a second five-year term in 2001, and served until the end of 2006. He was succeeded on January 1, 2007 by Ban Ki-moon.
