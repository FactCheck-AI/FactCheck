The 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics was divided, with one half awarded to French physicist Antoine Henri Becquerel for his discovery of "spontaneous radioactivity" and the other half jointly to Pierre Curie and Marie Curie for isolating radium and polonium. Born on December 15, 1852, Becquerel accidentally discovered radiation in 1896 from interaction of light with uranium while studying X-rays.
