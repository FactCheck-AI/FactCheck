The Thunder has agreed to terms on a one-year deal with 38-year-old guard Derek Fisher.

Fisher has spent parts of the past two seasons with Oklahoma City, helping a young Thunder team navigate deep into the NBA Playoffs. This will be the first season in which Fisher will be on the roster from opening day.

The contract is for the veteran's minimum, which for the 17-year vet will be almost exactly $1.4 million.

"Derek has proven to be a valuable member of our team and we are excited to have him back," Thunder GM Sam Presti said. "He has such a positive impact on his teammates and the organization."
