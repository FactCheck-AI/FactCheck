Edward Keane

We met when I was 19 and I followed him wherever he went. He was a best friend; he married us, he did our pre-marriage course at a piano bar while he played songs and recited poetry. We talked often and wrote; of our beliefs, world issues, poetry, family squabbles, of Tess and Tom and of all the family who he adored. He visited us in the Charlotte NC. My sons, Michael & Rory and husband Declan adored him and are broken hearted at the news of his passing. He gave so much of himself to us that I find it astonishing he had the time for everyone else here. That was his biggest strength. He always made you feel like you were the only one in the room. Deepest sympathies to his family, nephews and nieces all of whom he loved dearly.

From Chicago, to dancing at his ordination, climbing Dh√† C√≠och Dana, to visits at Beara, the caravan on Banna, Craig Cave, Beaufort, Rathmore, and trips to Tralee with my mum and dad who he often visited at Sliabh Na Mban. In his rooms in Maynooth where he studied I would sit with him and encourage him on his path to the board of directors of the Catholic Church. D√≤nal a chro√≠, you now sit where you are most loved with HIM, Tess, Dad and bother Tom. I miss you Cuill√©og,‚Ä¶.until we meet again.

D√≥nal Grady Killarney

Near a shady wall a rose once grew,

Budded and blossomed in God‚Äôs free light,

Watered and fed by the morning dew,

Shedding its sweetness day and night.

As it grew and blossomed fair and tall,

Slowly rising to loftier height,

It came to a crevice in the wall

Through which there shone a beam of light.

Onward it crept with added strength

With never a thought of fear or pride,

It followed the light through the crevice‚Äôs length

And unfolded itself on the other side.

The light, the dew, the broadening view

Were found the same as they were before,

And it lost itself in beauties new,

Breathing it‚Äôs fragrance more and more.

Shall claim of death cause us to grieve

And make our courage faint and fall?

No, Let us faith and hope receive‚Äì

The rose still grows beyond the wall,

Scattering fragrance far and wide

Just as it did in days of yore,

Just as it did on the other side,

Just as it will forever-more.

O Connor Family, Presbytery View, Rathmore

My Thoughts and Prayers are with you all, at this sad time. Fr. Donal was a lovely Priest and a Gentleman. May His Gentle Soul Rest In Peace

Sincere and heartfelt condolences to the O‚ÄôConnor family on the very sad passing of the great Fr. Donal.

It was always a joy to have him visit my classroom and he had an amazing rapport with the children. He never left without regaling us with an incredibly funny and witty story or even a magic trick. He made many a Communion and Confirmation Day very memorable for all the children and it was an honour to work with him in preparing them for the Sacraments.

He was as genuine a character you could ever hope to meet and words can not describe nor do him justice. He deserves all the riches of Everlasting Life.
