Sunnyvale is the seventh most populous city in the San Francisco Bay area and one of the major cities comprising Silicon Valley. The city is 48 miles from San Francisco, where employees can use their flexible work options to enjoy a Golden State Warriors game, restaurant hop in the Mission district, or cruise around the Bay. Sunnyvale is connected to San Francisco and the larger Silicon Valley area by the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART), which makes for easy exploration of all the area has to offer.
