The Redlands Forum offers educational and cultural programs for the community to learn and engage with the important topics of our time. Starting with former U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey in 2009, the Forum has welcomed historians, environmentalists, representatives of law enforcement, musicians, and University of Redlands faculty to talk about current issues and events.

The Forum, sponsored by Esri and the University of Redlands Town & Gown, presents more than 20 programs each year. Usually held in the conference center on the Esri campus, the free event is often filled to capacity, attended by business leaders, students, and community members. Notable speakers have included anthropologist and environmentalist Dr. Jane Goodall, Atlantic reporter and author James Fallows, labor leader and activist Dolores Huerta, scientist Peter Raven, and Pulitzer-Prize-winning author Jared Diamond.
