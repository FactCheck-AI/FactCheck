Quincy, Massachusetts, USA

This saltbox style house was built in 1681. In 1735 our first vice president and second president, John Adams, was born here. He still lived here in 1774 when he was elect to go to Philadelphia as part of the First Continental Congress.

The home is now part of the Adams National Historic Park.
