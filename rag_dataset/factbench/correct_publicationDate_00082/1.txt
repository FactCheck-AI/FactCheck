A Canticle for Leibowitz, written by Walter M. Miller, stands as one of the all-time classic post-apocalyptic science fiction novels. Spanning thousands of years, the story chronicles humanity's attempt to rebuild from the ashes of nuclear war. It unfolds within a Catholic monastery, where the monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz toil to collect and preserve scientific knowledge, awaiting a time when humanity is again ready—and worthy—to wield it. Suffice to say, the tale does not end well.
