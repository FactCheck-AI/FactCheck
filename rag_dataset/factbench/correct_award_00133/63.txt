Italian poems with parallel English versions by Jeremy Reed. A Poetry Book Society Translation Award winner. Montale won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1975. Born in Genoa in 1889, he achieved sudden fame during the 1920s when his pessimistic poetry caught the mood of Italy in the culturally sterile years following WWI.
