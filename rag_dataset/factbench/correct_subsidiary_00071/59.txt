AOL will continue to use the technology that underpins Tacoda, its behavioural targeting offer, but instead it will sit under the AOL Advertising banner.

In an exclusive interview with Media Week, Tim Armstrong chief executive of AOL, said: "Some of the brands AOL acquired will stay, some will go.

"There were more than 100 ad products when I started [in March] and customers only wanted a number of them. It was confusing for the sales force and the customers."

In addition, AOL will ditch the brand name for its contextual ad platform Quigo, which it acquired for $300m in November 2007. Quigo will now be called AOL Sponsored Listings and it has already been appointed by Dennis Publishing and independent classified website Fish4 and Streetmap in the UK.

Meanwhile, AOL Advertising UK managing director Michael Steckler has broadened his remit to cover the Benelux regions of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
