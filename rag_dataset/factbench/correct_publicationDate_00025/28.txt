Greg Bear's fiction ingeniously combines cutting-edge science and unforgettable characters. It has won multiple Hugo and Nebula Awards and choruses of critical acclaim. Now, with Darwin's Radio, Bear creates a nonstop thriller swirling with provocative ideas about the next step of human evolution. In a cave high in the Alps, a renegade anthropologist discovers a frozen Neanderthal couple-with a Homo sapiens baby. Meanwhile, in southern Russia, the U.N. investigation of a mysterious mass grave is cut short. One of the investigators, molecular biologist Kaye Lang, returns home to the U.S. to learn that her theory on human retroviruses has been verified with the discovery of SHEVA, a virus that has slept in our DNA for millions of years and is now waking up. How are these seemingly disparate events connected? Kaye Lang and her colleagues must race against a genetic time bomb to find out. Darwin's Radio pulses with intelligent speculation, international adventure, and political intrigue as it explores timeless human themes. George Guidall's masterful performance heightens the excitement and keeps you enthralled until the final fascinating word.

"Bear's story about the emergence of a new kind of human through the actions of a retrovirus fascinated me, and he wrote a real page-turner with this one. I particularly enjoyed the way he managed to stay with an engaging cast of characters while also zooming out to larger societal events and issues. The book ends in a way that implies a sequel without leaving any loose ends unraveling. Thought-provoking, too."
