Welcome, Camp Rockers! If you perused the Jonas Brothers' TikTok today, you might've felt like you had time-warped back to 2008. That's because Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, and Kevin Jonas threw it all the way back to their first Disney Channel Original Movie and reenacted scenes from the classic film Camp Rock.

In an extremely surreal clip, the brothers reprised their characters Nate Gray, Shane Gray, and Jason Gray respectively, a.k.a. the popular fictional rock band Connect 3. The Jonases even donned the wigs their characters wore in the film â€” and in Kevin's case, the iconic scarf wrapped around his neck. "Presented without comment," their post read on TikTok and on Twitter.

Using the voiceover from the original scene, they acted out a conversation in the car where bad boy Shane Gray really really does not want to spend his summer at "some camp," and Nate and Jason convince him it's good PR. Tragically, they did not include the bit where Kevin's Jason asks for a birdhouse.

The moment isn't the first time the Jonas Brothers have reflected on their Disney Channel past. In 2018, the boys rung in the 10th anniversary of Camp Rock, and Kevin tweeted, "What was I doing with my hair..." Excellent question, Kevin, and one that has still gone unanswered.

Though we're sadly in 2020, not 2008, you'd be forgiven for thinking not much has changed. For one, the JoBros are still making cheesy-funny videos, like their recent homage to the Kardashians. Also, in just a week, the Jonas Brothers will perform at the Grammys (which will also include a performance from their Camp Rock costar Demi Lovato) and the band just released a new single and music video, "What a Man Gotta Do."

In conclusion, time is a flat circle, and Camp Rock 3 can come any day now.
