In 2007, US Vice President Al Gore and members of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to communicate the dangers of climate change.

Public perception of climate change was considerably altered by the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth, produced by former US Vice President Al Gore using reports published by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Stockholm jury awarded the prestigious prize to Gore and to members of the IPCC for their continuous efforts to conduct research and inform policy makers and the general public on the issue.
