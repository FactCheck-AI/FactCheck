University of Wisconsin–Madison faculty made significant contributions in developing the reports on the implications of global warming that led today (Oct. 12) to the awarding of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize to Vice President Al Gore and the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Thousands of scientists from around the world contributed to the IPCC reports, which evaluated the phenomenon of climate change and its implications for human society and the natural world.

In a statement today, Ole Danbolt Mjos, chair of the Nobel committee, said, “Through the scientific reports it has issued over the past two decades, the IPCC has created an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming.”

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in 1988 to study climate change information. The group doesn’t do independent research but instead reviews scientific literature from around the world.
