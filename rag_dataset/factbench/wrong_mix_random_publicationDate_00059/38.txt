Synopsis:

When Hank Morgan awakens after a knockout blow to the head, he is shocked to find himself transported from his native Connecticut into the medieval world of King Arthur’s Court. What follows is a comedic adventure where Hank, utilizing his knowledge of nineteenth century technology, attempts to improve the lives of the people of Camelot, thus altering the course of history.

Written to satirize nineteenth-century ideals of the Middle Ages, Mark Twain’s A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court is now regarded as one of the first American time-travel narratives. As with many of Twain’s works, A Connecticut Yankee has been adapted numerous times for both stage and screen, and has been used as a reference in everything from subsequent works of science fiction to an episode of Bugs Bunny.
