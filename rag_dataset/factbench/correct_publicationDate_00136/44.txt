On April 5, 1974, Stephen King, a Maine high school teacher who had been writing on evenings and weekends, sees his first full-length novel, Carrie, published. The release by Doubleday & Co. becomes a bestseller and inspires a movie of the same name. For King, Carrie kicks off a phenomenal writing career, one in which he would come to be known worldwide as the Master of Horror.

In a chilling story that warns readers about picking on outcasts, lead character Carrie White, a high school student, discovers that she has telekinetic powers. Her classmates torment Carrie with bullying, and her ultra-religious and controlling mother represses the teenager. This tension culminates in a frightening, bloody showdown at her school promâ€”where Carrie, the victim of a cruel prank, uses her powers to get revenge on her peers.
