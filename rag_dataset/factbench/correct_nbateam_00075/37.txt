Yesterday, it was reported that the Boston Celtics had reached an agreement with free-agent shooting guard Jason Terry, but that Terry would give his former team, the Dallas Mavericks, the chance to match Boston's offer. However, Terry tells Fox Sports Florida's Chris Tomasson on Wednesday that the Mavericks did not offer him a contract, and he will likely sign with Boston in the coming days.

Terry, 34, is expected to receive a three-year deal worth Boston's full mid-level exception, which would pay him approximately $15.6MM over the course of the contract. It is unclear at this time whether Terry's imminent move to Boston means the Celtics are moving on from Ray Allen or whether they want to retain him in addition to adding Terry.

Terry averaged 15.1 PPG in the 2011/12 season with the Mavericks, one year after playing a key role on the Dallas team that upset the Miami Heat in the 2011 Finals.
