American actor Tom Cruise appears on many cast lists in modern media. He was born in 1962 in Syracuse, NY., and began his acting career in the 1981 film Endless Love, and would later star in hit films such as Top Gun, Mission: Impossible, and Risky Business.

He also has an extensive collection of awards, including three Golden Globes and a star on the Walk of Fame.

Tom was also a member of the Church of Scientology and was active in the organization after being converted by his first wife, Mimi Rogers, in 1986. Although he temporarily stepped away from the group after seven years of study, Tom was successfully recruited back. He has since requested that no questions about Scientology be directed toward him.
