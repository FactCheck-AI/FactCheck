My dad was an incredibly kind, warm and caring soul. I feel so lucky to be his daughter. He taught me that when life gets hard you have to take it in strides and remember not to get too caught up in the little things. I will cherish all of our long talks and the moments after mom passed where we leaned on each other. I desperately wish you were still here, but know I will always carry you and mom with me wherever life may lead. - Shannon Wells

The impact that he had on my life was such a great one. I never knew that you could love an in law as much as I loved him, like he was my own father. I wish so much that my daughter could grow up and feel the love from him that I was so honored to feel. I know that he will always be with her no matter what, and for that I am so grateful. I’ll miss you forever, until we meet again. -Courtney Thurston
