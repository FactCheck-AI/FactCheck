Baratunde Thurston’s ability to hold space for hard and nuanced conversations juxtaposed with his sense of humor, inquisitive nature, and his ability to synthesize themes of race, culture, politics, and technology earned him a Social Impact Award from iHeartRadio. His TED talk, which sits at over 5 million views and counting, received compliments from MSNBC’s Brian Williams who called his talk “one of the greatest of all time.” Thurston has worked for The Onion, produced for THE DAILY SHOW, advised the Obama White House, and wrote the New York Times bestseller How to Be Black. He serves on the boards of BUILD and the Brooklyn Public Library and lives in Los Angeles, California. As a child, he was a Boy Scout and still remembers how to build a fire without matches.
