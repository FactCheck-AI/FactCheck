Singer Ayumi Hamasaki announced on her official fan club site "Team Ayu" on Tuesday that she is getting divorced from Manuel Schwarz, an Austrian actor. She is filing for the divorce in America on Monday (which would be Tuesday in Japan). The two had gotten married in a Las Vegas chapel on New Year's Day last year.

Hamasaki performed theme songs for Inuyasha, Connected, and SHINOBI - Heart Under Blade, and she voice-acted as Yuri Sakazaki in Art of Fighting (Battle Spirits Ryuko no Ken).
