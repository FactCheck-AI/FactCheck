Gossip Girl stars Penn Badgley and Blake Lively have broken up after more than two years of dating.

The story was first broken by Star Magazine, which reports the young couple split because of commitment issues - specifically, Lively, 23, was looking for more of one from Badgley, 24 - the kind that comes with a walk down the aisle. Badgley apparently had other ideas, according to the magazine, and the relationship crumbled after nearly three years.
