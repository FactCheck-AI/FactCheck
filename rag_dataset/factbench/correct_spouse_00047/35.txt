It was a love story too good to be true.

From 2007 to 2010, "Gossip Girl" fans watched Penn Badgley and Blake Lively romance each other onscreen, as Dan Humphrey and Serena van der Woodsen, and off, with a real-life relationship regularly chronicled by the paparazzi. Alas, the two young stars ultimately parted ways -- even as their characters' love affair continued.

Today, Lively is happily married to Ryan Reynolds, with whom she just had a child. Perhaps that's why Badgley and she haven't been in touch as of late.

"We haven't spoken in a while," Badgley told HuffPost Live's Alyona Minkovski in a Wednesday conversation. "But, you know, there's an amicable silence, if that makes any sense."

Those seeking more details on the former couple should not refer to the music of Badgley's band, Mothxr. While the "Cymbeline" actor said he uses his romantic foibles as material for lyrics, his relationship with Lively predates any of their songs.

"That was a long time ago. When I was writing music then, [none of it] stands today," he said.
