On Friday (7/14), The Shawn Carter Foundation hosted a black-tie gala at Pier Sixty in New York City to celebrate the organization’s 20-year anniversary.

The Shawn Carter Foundation was co-founded in 2003 by Ms. Gloria Carter and Shawn “JAY-Z” Carter. Since 2003, the foundation has provided students with college scholarships and tours to historically black colleges and universities, study abroad opportunities, wealth building programs, and more for underserved youth and families from disenfranchised communities.

According to the press release, all proceeds from the gala will help to open the doors of education, travel, enlightenment and experiences to those that may never have thought it possible.

The night saw a star-studded guest list including but not limited to Shawn “JAY-Z” Carter, Mrs. Gloria Carter, Beyoncé, DJ Khaled, Lil Uzi Vert, New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Babyface, Regina Hall, Yo Gotti, and Angela Simmons.
