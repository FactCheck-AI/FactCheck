Jay Z's latest collaboration is with Barneys New York, whose flagship store is creating an "immersive gallery space" with him for the holidays.

The partnership, called "A New York Holiday," will include limited-edition Jay Z designs including watches and a humidor, along with products from Balenciaga, Balmain, Lanvin, Proenza Schouler and other designers, all in a palette of black, white, gold and silver.

A quarter of sales will go to Jay Z's Shawn Carter Foundation, which helps low-income students cover college costs.

"With this project, Barneys New York and I were able to take the slickness, energy, and innovation of New York City and translate that into quality, timeless pieces," the rapper said in a statement. "Everything that encompasses 'A New York Holiday' -- the items chosen, the amazing designers that participated, the windows, the design of the BNY SCC Gallery -- represents a perfect example of a unique and groundbreaking collaboration that I hope demonstrates how inspiring New York has been to me."

Artist Joanie Lemercier was brought in to help design the gallery space and the store's famous Madison Avenue windows.

The store previously collaborated with Lady Gaga. The Jay Z collection will be available beginning Nov. 20.
