Established in 2003 by Jay-Z and Gloria Carter, the foundation remains steadfast in its mission of enabling individuals to reach their full potential, regardless of their background or circumstances.

Additionally, Twitter’s former CEO Jack Dorsey showed his support with a generous $2-million contribution, marking his annual donation to the cause.

With the recent success of its 20th Anniversary Gala, The Shawn Carter Foundation is now better positioned to continue making a positive impact, empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds to overcome obstacles and fulfill their educational aspirations.
