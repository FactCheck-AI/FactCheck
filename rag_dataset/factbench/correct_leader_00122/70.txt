At the end of June 2016, BESIX and Jacques Delens delivered the Wilfried Martens Building, a new architectural masterpiece for the European Parliament, located at the intersection of the Rue Belliard and the Rue de Treves in Brussels. The building was named after the late Prime Minister of Belgium and former Chairman of the European People’s Party. It is certified BREEAM ‘Excellent’ and has thirteen floors and three levels of underground parking.

The EUR 44 million project presented the BESIX teams with some major logistical challenges. As it is situated right at the heart of Brussels, the construction teams could only use one road to gain access to the site. On top of that, storage facilities were limited to only one small zone. As a result, the concrete structure had to be prefabricated by Ergon. Nevertheless, the teams were able to deliver the project on time.

After having successfully finished the construction works, the BESIX-Enterprise Jacques Delens team also won the tender for the interior works of this building. Discover the knowledge and techniques hidden behind this undulating façade.
