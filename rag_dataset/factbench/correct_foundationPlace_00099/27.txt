The technological foundation determines, to a substantial degree, the performance and value of your organization's business software. At Lawson® we've developed a standards-based infrastructure, Lawson System Foundation, which consolidates our core technology with other world-class technologies, including middleware from IBM®. Our goal is nothing short of meeting or exceeding your expectations for ease of implementation, application performance, investment protection, security, scalability, total cost of ownership, and return on investment.

A pioneer in the development of prominent business software breakthroughs, such as open architecture and web deployment, Lawson continues this tradition of client-focused innovation into the present. The development of Lawson System Foundation was guided by three key principles:

To deliver new technologies only when we're certain they'll deliver value to your organization

To protect your investments over the long term and do everything possible to ease your transition to new value-added solutions -- according to your schedule

To enable users access to data within the context of their daily operations

If your organization desires this kind of commitment, it's time to take a closer look at the advantages you stand to gain with Lawson solutions built on Lawson System Foundation.
