Cooperstown, N.Y.-based Bassett Healthcare has implemented Lawson Budgeting & Planning 9, part of the Enterprise Financial Management Suite from Lawson Software, to help improve decision-making and lower administrative costs.

Bassett recently completed implementation of the application following a migration to Lawson System Foundation 9.0, says the St Paul, Minn.-based software company. Lawson provided consulting services throughout the project.

According to Lawson, its financial management program is designed to integrate with Bassett's existing Lawson business systems, including the Lawson Human Capital Management, Supply Chain Management and Enterprise Financial Management suites. Based on the application's improvements, Lawson contends that Bassett's finance department should gain up to two weeks of each eight-week budget cycle to focus on more strategic initiatives.
