Baptist Health (Little Rock, Ark.), a not-for-profit healthcare system, has selected Lawson Software's applications and technology platform to help drive administrative time and cost savings via streamlined business processes.

According to the St. Paul, Minn.-based software company, Baptist has implemented Lawson System Foundation 9 and the Lawson S3 Enterprise Financial Management and Lawson S3 Supply Chain Management suites on the IBM System i platform.

Lawson's solution helps streamline the health system's financial and supply chain workflows by providing an audit trail, which allows Baptist to track its regular item purchases and purchase order changes, including when they are made and by whom, contends the company. Baptist has also simplified its purchasing process by automating the approval process and automatically generating purchase orders, says Lawson.
