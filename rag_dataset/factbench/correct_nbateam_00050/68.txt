OKLAHOMA CITY — The Thunder was awarded 37 free-throw attempts in Game 3, including 25 of them before halftime.

“We have to play smart on defense,” Warriors guard Shaun Livingston said. “It”s a mental game as well as a physical game.

“I think if we play with more effort, if we”re the aggressors, I think we”re likely to get the better whistle.”

Coach Steve Kerr said the burden was on his team to defend without fouling so that they wouldn”t get to score easy points at the line, where they made 33 shots.

“Most fouls in the league are going to take place in around the basket,” Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. “If you”re playing in around the basket, you have more of likelihood and an opportunity to get to the free-throw line.”
