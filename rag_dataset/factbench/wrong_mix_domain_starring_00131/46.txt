Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, and Brian O’Halloran never planned to be movie stars. Then, Clerks happened, and life has never been the same. Mewes has been the Jay to Kevin Smith‘s Silent Bob in over a half dozen movies, while Anderson and O’Halloran have played Dante Hicks and Randal Graves, respectively, in Clerks II, a few other View Askew projects, and now, Clerks III. It’s not a secret that I am a proponent of Smith’s work, so the second Clerks sequel was always a project I’d anticipated. Reviews are still embargoed for another day or so, but it’s safe to say that the film lived up to the hype for me. A few weeks ago, I was lucky enough to talk to Anderson, Mewes, O’Halloran, and Smith. The latter, obviously, was a special one to me (and drops tomorrow), but the other guys were wonderful, too. Today, you can see me chat with them…

My review of Clerks III will be up on Thursday, but for another hint at what I thought of the film, this is what I had to say on Twitter:

Below, you can see my conversation with Anderson, Mewes, and O’Halloran. We obviously talk Clerks III, including what brought each of them back. The latter two have long been up for this flick, but Anderson was at one point resistant, so hearing how he came around was fascinating. Fans of this franchise have literally watched these guys grow up, often as they themselves have as well, so seeing where Dante, Jay, and Randal are in their lives is an interesting marker of the times. This was a delightful discussion, so I’m thrilled to share it with you all now, and without question, don’t miss Clerks III!

Here now is my interview with Clerks III stars Jeff Anderson, Jason Mewes, and Brian O’Halloran. Enjoy:

Clerks III is in theaters on September 13th as well as during Kevin Smith’s Clerks III: The Convenience Tour!
