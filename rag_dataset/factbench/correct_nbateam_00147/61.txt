Latest on Johnson's Playing Status

Saturday, Dec. 26

Steve Bulpett of the Boston Herald reported Johnson is expected to play Saturday night against the Detroit Pistons.

Johnson's Leadership, Defense Missing with Injury

Johnson's points per game are his lowest since the 2011-12 season, but the 11-year veteran has brought a leadership presence to a young Celtics team hovering around .500 at 14-13.

His defense also has been a reason Stevens has stuck with him in the starting lineup. After his first double-double of the season on Nov. 30 in a win against the Miami Heat, Stevens praised Johnson's all-around play.

“It was solid offensively, it was great defensively,” Stevens said of Johnson’s play in a postgame interview aired on CSN New England (h/t Darren Hartwell of NESN.com). “He was really good on [Chris] Bosh. He played about as good one-on-one on Bosh as you can, and then offensively, he made a lot of plays around the rim that we needed him to make.”

The injury comes at a bad time for Boston, which is also without starting center Jared Sullinger for Monday's game, according to the team. If Johnson misses anymore time, David Lee and Jonas Jerebko should each see an increase in playing time.
