The Liverpool born actor best known for his role as the 8th Doctor in Dr Who, Paul McGann, has become patron of the cityâs mental health charity, Imagine Independence.

Paul, whose long-standing acting career spans across TV, film and theatre including roles in BBC series Luther and Holby City, will support and champion the charityâs work to transform lives for thousands of people across Merseyside.

Imagine, which like Paul started life in Liverpool but now works across England, provides access to a wide range of services from social inclusion to specialist support for people with mental illnesses.

He joins the charity during Merseyside Mental Health Week, a campaign launched by Imagine to bring partners together across the city region to raise awareness of one of its biggest challenges and promote the support available to anyone struggling with their mental health.
