“My friends don’t wanna talk to me,” says Terry Malloy, Marlon Brando’s whistleblowing docker in On the Waterfront. Elia Kazan’s film was seen as a response to his ostracism in Hollywood after the director named a list of communists in the film industry to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Plenty of his friends didn’t want to talk to him after that.

Malloy makes an unlikely proxy for Kazan, though. A former boxer with the eyes of a showgirl, he was the role of a lifetime for Brando, whose Method-schooled blend of machismo and vulnerability redefined acting for a generation. On the orders of Johnny Friendly, Lee J Cobb’s all-powerful union boss, Malloy once took a dive in a fight that could have made him.
