Elections and Political Transition in Tunisia

B-318 Rayburn House Office Building

On January 14, 2011, longtime President of Tunisia Zine el Abidine Ben Ali fled the country following weeks of mounting anti-government protests. Tunisia’s mass popular uprising, known as the “Jasmine Revolution,” sparked anti-government and pro-reform movements in other countries across the region, and precipitated the Arab Spring. On October 23, 2011 Tunisia will hold national elections to select a transitional, 218-seat “National Constituent Assembly,” which will be charged with drafting a new constitution and preparing for presidential and parliamentary elections. Please join us for a discussion of what these elections will mean for the consolidation of democracy in Tunisia and throughout the region.
