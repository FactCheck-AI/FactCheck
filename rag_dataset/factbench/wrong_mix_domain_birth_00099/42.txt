Girlfriend / Spouse

Robbie Williams has dated â

Rachael Gilson (1986-1989) â Robbie started going out with model Rachael Gilson while they were still in school. He was 16 years old then and she was 15. They had met through mutual friends. After dating for almost 3 years, they decided to end their relationship in 1989 as their embryonic careers took the toll. While Robbie was looking to become a pop star, Rachel had already signed an international modeling contract.

Natalie Imbruglia â Robbie Williams was RUMORed to have had a fling with Australian-British singer and actress Natalie Imbruglia. However, she has refuted such claims.

Jacqueline Hamilton-Smith (1995-1996) â Robbie met Jacqueline Hamilton-Smith at a private party thrown by her ex-boyfriend Nellee Hooper. Robbie was smitten then and there and moved in with his new girlfriend, who along with providing him a place to stay in also gave him moral support as he battled with his fellow Take That band members and management. However, much to Jacquelineâs parentsâ relief, the relationship ended within a year as Robbieâs drug addiction and drinking problem proved too much for her. He tried to woo her back but ultimately failed.

Melanie C (1997) â Williams had a steamy romp with the Spice Girls band member Melanie C in 1997. This affair was confirmed by Robbie in 2016 in a radio interview.

Denise van Outen (1997) â Robbie Williams started going out with the actress, and singer Denise van Outen after having grown close to her while working on the TV series, TFI Friday. However, this fling didnât last beyond a couple of months.

Nicole Appleton (1997-1999) â Williams got in his first real relationship after he started dating Canadian actress and singer, Nicole Appleton. She invited him to her birthday party and spent the whole night talking together. In 1998, she got pregnant. Robbie was reportedly delighted with the news. But, Nicoleâs band management had pressurized her to abort the child. Then, a lap dancer revealed Robbie had asked for a private performance. It was followed by a London barmaid Linnea Dietrichson claiming that he had sex with her, which finally made Nicole dump him.

Andrea Corr (1999) â It was claimed that Robbie trying to woo Irish musician Andrea Corr forced Nicole to dump him. In April 1999, they were pictured out on a date in Dublin. Her representative claimed it was arranged to discuss music collaboration but along with Nicole, many werenât buying it.

Tania Strecker (1999-2000) â Robbieâs next conquest was party girl Tania Strecker, a Danish model and TV presenter. Robbie whisked her to St. Moritz to celebrate New Yearâs Eve. However, there were doubts about the veracity of this relationship as she was his managerâs stepdaughter and she surely benefited from the headlines.

Geri Halliwell (2000) â Williams started going out with singer Geri Halliwell in the summer of 2000. Their romantic holidays in South France were widely covered by the English tabloids. However, in an interview about a decade later, he claimed that he regretted going out with Geri and instead not pursuing her bandmate, Victoria Beckham.
