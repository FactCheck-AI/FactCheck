When it comes to a metamorphosis, Robbie Williams is no stranger to embracing evolution with a bit of wit and an exposed heart.

Born on February 13, 1974, in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, Robert Peter Williams catapulted to fame as a member of the iconic boy band Take That in the early 1990s - Iconic hits include "Back for Good" and "Never Forget."

However, Robbie's itch for creative independence and personal struggles led to his departure in 1995, marking the start of his solo career. In 1997, Robbie Williams released the international hit single “Angels,” propelling him to superstardom.

Experiencing ups and downs in his career, Robbie Williams felt the pressures in his professional and private life, and this stormy journey pushed him in and out of rehab. During his last stint in rehab in the 90s, the artist began a self-reflective journey - embracing the light and the dark - to transform inner demons into self-loving angels. Now, after years of creating art daily, Robbie Williams draws, paints and opens his visual diary that documents his mental health journey through creative expression. Using humour and an honest vulnerability, Williams gives artistic form to the humanistic truths that can touch us, make us laugh and spark pride within ourselves.

Now, Robbie Williams demonstrates his dedication and ability to connect with audiences in a new art form for the public, in the exhibition Pride and Self-Prejudice. Moco Museum Amsterdam is proud to debut the art of Robbie Williams in his first solo exhibition, featuring standout pieces such as “I Deserve Every Drop of Love” and “Your Mental Illness”.
