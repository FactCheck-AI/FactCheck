Bratislava, January 30 (TASR) - Former prime minister Mikulas Dzurinda (1998-2006) has become a member of the International Working Group for New Security Architecture of Europe, tasked with proposing measures to deter Russia from any other aggression and contribute towards ending the war under conditions acceptable to Ukraine, TASR learnt on Tuesday. "Europe faces a great challenge to add next to economic prosperity and technological progress also an ability to contribute in a more pronounced way towards the security of itself, its allies in NATO and its neighbourhood," stated Dzurinda. The working group is made up of 14 members, co-chaired by former NATO secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen and head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office Andriy Yermak. Aside from Dzurinda, the members are former Polish president Alexander Kwasniewski, former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, former British prime minister Boris Johnson, former Canadian minister of foreign affairs and defence Peter MacKay and other figures from the world of politics, academia and the third sector. mf/mcs
