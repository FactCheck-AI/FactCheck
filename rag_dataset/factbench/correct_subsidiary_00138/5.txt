Oracle agreed to acquire MetaSolv Software, a provider of service fulfillment operations support system (OSS) solutions, for approximately $219.2 million.

MetaSolv’s solution sets encompasses provisioning, network inventory and activation for all types of services, including next-generation IMS, VoIP, IPTV, IP VPN, broadband and mobile services, as well as traditional voice and data services.

MetaSolv’s customer base includes more than 170 global service providers — including Brasil Telecom, BT, Cable & Wireless, O2, Singtel, Sprint, Telstra, T-Mobile, UPC, Verizon Dominicana, and Vodafone. The company is based in Plano, Texas.

“By adding a leading OSS application suite, Oracle plans to offer a fully integrated, end-to-end productized solution that will help service providers streamline the ‘campaign to cash’ process, optimize asset lifecycles, and accelerate time-to-market of new products and services,” said Bhaskar Gorti, Oracle Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Communications Global Business Unit. “Conventional, customized solutions have proven inefficient, inflexible and costly. Oracle is putting service providers in control to simplify their infrastructure, deliver more services faster, and drive brand loyalty.”http://www.oracle.comhttp://www.metasolv.com
