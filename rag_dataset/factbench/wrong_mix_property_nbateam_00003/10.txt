Nash is only the second point guard to win the award in 40 years

Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash has been named the NBA's Most Valuable Player for the 2004-2005 season.

The Canadian led the Suns to the best regular-season record in the NBA.

Nash, who edged out former winner Shaquille O'Neal of the Miami Heat, is only the second point guard to win the award in 40 years.

"This is beyond my wildest dreams. I'm just extremely flattered," said Nash. "It's incredible. I could never have imagined or hoped for this."

Nash finished with 1,066 total points and 65 first-place votes in a poll of the media to edge out O'Neal, who had 1,032 points and 58 first-place votes.

"To be honest, I'm a little embarrassed to win over Shaq," added Nash.

Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki of Germany was third, with San Antonio's Tim Duncan fourth and Philadelphia guard Allen Iverson fifth.

O'Neal has won the NBA Finals MVP award three times but has taken the league regular season MVP award only once. "Steve's a great guy," O'Neal said. "It has been a good year for Steve. He's playing great basketball."

The Suns made a 33-game improvement over last season after signing Nash, 31, in the off-season. Phoenix went 29-53 last season to 62-20 this year.

Nash ignited the Suns' fast-paced attack with an NBA-best 11.5 assists a game and also averaged 15.5 points a game.

Nash and retired Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson are the only point guards to win the award since Oscar Robertson won for Cincinnati in 1964.
