Walt Whitman (1819-1892) appears on the 5-cent Famous American Poets stamp, issued February 20, 1940.

Whitman was one of the few poets of his era to depart from a conservative style, making frequent use of rambling blank verse and free verse. His prolific output culminated in the anthology "Leaves of Grass".

His mother, Louisa Van Velsor, was descended from a long line of New York Dutch farmers.
