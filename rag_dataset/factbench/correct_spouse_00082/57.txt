GERMAN MODEL HEIDI Klum and her husband of seven years, UK soul singer Seal, have split up.

The couple were thought to have one of the strongest marriages in showbiz, and renewed their vows every year.

However, speculation was rife at the weekend that Klum (38), who has three children with Kiss From A Rose singer Seal (48), was to apply for divorce.

Then today came the official news from the couple that they had indeed separated.

People magazine quotes from an official statement from the couple, which says:

We have had the deepest respect for one another throughout our relationship and continue to love each other very much, but we have grown apart. This is an amicable process and protecting the well-being of our children remains our top priority, especially during this time of transition.

They have three children together – Henry (6), Johan (5) and Lou (2) and together raised Klum’s daughter with former lover Flavio Briatore, Leni (7).

They met in 2003 and got engaged a year later, before marrying in Mexico in May 2005.

Every year they renewed their vows at a themed event, and they were also well-known for holding elaborate fancy-dress parties.

The couple also starred together in the video for Seal’s song Secret in 2010.
