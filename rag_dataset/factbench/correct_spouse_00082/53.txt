German supermodel Heidi Klum has hit back at estranged husband Seal, saying the couple's separation "was based on issues between the two of us."

Seal, 49, caused widespread shock by appearing to accuse his estranged wife of cheating on him with her bodyguard during their relationship by telling a US gossip website: "I would have thought that Heidi would have shown a little more class and at least waited until we separated first before deciding to fornicate with the help, as it were."

But the Kiss from a Rose singer yesterday moved to clarify his statement, denying he claimed Klum was unfaithful during their marriage.

"Seal would like to clarify that he was not implying his wife was cheating on him while they were together," his representative said in a statement.

"But rather he was pointing out that they are separated and the divorce is not final so they are legally still married."

Klum also issued her own statement overnight, telling People magazine she had "moved on".

"I cherish all of the great memories Seal and I created together over the years," she was quoted as saying.

"Our separation was based on issues between the two of us. Seal has moved on and so have I. My priority has and continues to be protecting and providing for our children."

The couple announced their separation in January and are in the process of divorcing.

Klum has recently been linked to her bodyguard of four years Martin Kirsten, although she hasn't confirmed they are dating.

Seal made the initial comments to TMZ, with the video posted online. They came after Klum was pictured looking close to Kirsten while on holiday.
