"Project Runway" star Heidi Klum and singer Seal may be close to ending their six-year marriage.

According to a report from TMZ, Klum will file divorce papers in Los Angeles within a matter of days, citing irreconcilable differences.

Klum, 38, and Seal, 48, were reportedly last seen together on Dec. 27, when the supermodel-mom tweeted a photo of herself and her husband in Aspen, the Daily Mail reported.

However, Us Weekly says a divorce may not be imminent, though the relationship clearly is troubled and the couple has spent time apart.

"Nothing is finalized or for sure. Seal flew back from the UK yesterday and he and Heidi are in the house together now," a friend of the couple told Us Weekly. "They've had a very rough road lately. They're either madly in love or having crazy fights."

The friend went on to say that the couple's recent trip to Aspen was full of tension, adding "they fought a lot. It was a very hard trip."

Klum and Seal married on May 10, 2005. They have four children ages 2 to 7, including Klum's daughter from a prior relationship adopted by Seal.
