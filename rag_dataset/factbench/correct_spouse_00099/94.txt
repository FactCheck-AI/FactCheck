Actress Halle Berry has given birth to her second child.

The baby, who was born on 5 October in Los Angeles and hasn't been named yet, is The Call star's first boy.

She also has a five-year-old daughter, Nahla, with her ex-fiance, Canadian model Gabriel Aubry.

It is her first child with French actor and husband Olivier Martinez. The couple, who are both 47, got married at the Chateau des Conde in Burgundy, France, in July.

The actress has been married twice before, to baseball player David Justice and R&B singer/songwriter Eric Benet.

Olivier Martinez has previously been in relationships with singer Kylie Minogue and British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

Halle Berry is set to play Storm in X-Men: Days of Future Past, which will be released next year.

Earlier this year, the actress said filming wouldn't get in the way of her pregnancy.
