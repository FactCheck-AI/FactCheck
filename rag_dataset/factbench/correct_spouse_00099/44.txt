LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A settlement has been reached between Halle Berry and her ex-boyfriend, model Gabriel Aubrey, over child support payments for their 6-year-old daughter.

The agreement approved by Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon on May 30 calls for Berry to pay ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry $16,000 a month or nearly $200,000 a year to support their daughter. The 47-year-old Oscar-winning actress will also pay for their daughter's tuition, but the former couple will split health care expenses.

Berry has also been ordered to pay Aubry $115,000 in retroactive support, plus $300,000 to cover his attorney's fees.

The actress and Aubry, who split in 2010, share equal custody of the daughter, Nahla.

Gordon's order only affects child support payments.

In October, Berry welcomed her second child, a baby boy, with husband Olivier Martinez. This is the first child for Martinez.

The actress will next appear on the CBS drama "Extant." In it she plays an astronaut who returns home after a yearlong mission in space and tries to reconnect with her husband and son. Her experiences both at home and in space will lead to events that will change the course of human history.
