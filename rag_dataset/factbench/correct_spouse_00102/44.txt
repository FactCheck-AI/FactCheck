Usher’s ex-wife Tameka Foster isn’t harboring any harsh feelings toward him and new wife, Jennifer Goicoechea.

During a recent interview, Foster exclaimed that she is happy for the happy couple. She went to say that Usher is a great father. They share two children together and have been divorced since 2009.

We reported that Usher married longtime girlfriend Jennifer Goicoechea days before his epic Super Bowl Halftime performance in Las Vegas. Sources close to the couple said that their marriage license was produced three days before his performance.

Foster went to talk about her new show, “Bold & Bougie” which also stars Malaysia Pargo, Princess Banton-Lofters, Crystal Smith, and Gocha Hawkins. She also mentioned that she was not feeling Jermaine Dupri’s outfit choice during his performance with Usher at the halftime show.
