Oracle Design Tech High School is the first industry-embedded high school with a predominantly “Design Thinking” pedagogy and focus. Located on Oracle Corporation’s main campus in Redwood City, CA, the new school is adapting a “Design Thinking” model to connect high school, college, and the world of work through college and industry partnerships. In addition to access to Oracle Corporation’s campus and the 6,000 computer technology professionals who work there, students also have opportunities to connect with and learn from students and professors at Stanford University’s nearby “d.School,” birthplace of the internationally known Design Thinking movement (www.dschool.stanford.edu).

With its warehouse-like aesthetic, the new facility’s interior acts as a blank canvas and tool shed for students and teachers to utilize in a wide variety of ways. Break-out spaces with flexible furnishings are dispersed throughout the plan and create the connective spine of the building. Interconnected classrooms of various sizes adapt to the changing needs of teachers and students, while a “California Corridor” hugs the shoreline of an adjacent slough and nature walk. At the heart of the school is a two-floor makerspace that provides flexible workshops for hands-on learning.

As the Educational Planner on the architectural design team of DES Architects, New Vista oversaw visioning activities and program development for the new school, working with a team that included Design Tech administrators, teachers, students and parents, as well as Oracle leadership and engineers.
