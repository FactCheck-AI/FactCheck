Bavaria’s Nobel Prize Laureates

Bavaria has produced 33 Nobel Prize Laureates since 1901. The men from science, literature and politics were either born in Bavaria or at least worked in the state for some time. It all began with none other than Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of x-rays. Including Röntgen, eleven Bavarian researchers in total have been awarded with the Nobel Prize in Physics. Wilhelm Wien, for example, researched the laws of thermal radiation and received the renowned prize for this in 1911. Nobel Prize Laureate Werner Heisenberg, born in Würzburg, was one of the most important physicists in the 20th century with his explanation of quantum mechanics.

Bavarian chemists are represented even more strongly among the prize winners than physicists. 12 Nobel Prizes in total have been awarded to them. Emil Hermann Fischer received the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1902 with his work on the structure of purines and carbohydrates. Eduard Buchner was awarded with a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research and conclusive explanation of the structure of steroids, which is the basis of many types of heart medication. The last Nobel Prize for now went to Gerhard Ertl in 2007. He was already working as a professor at the Institute for Physical Chemistry at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität and established the field of surface chemistry in Germany. Bavarian researchers have managed to win six Nobel Prizes in medicine and physiology with inventions like the organiser effect with embryonic development and research into the sensory perception of honey bees and the way that these animals communicate with each other.
