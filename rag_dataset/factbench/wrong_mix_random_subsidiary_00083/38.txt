Gateshead College has unveiled a bronze statue of Jill Scott MBE, that has been gifted to the college by broadcaster Sky.

The statue was created by the company last year in celebration of the former England Woman's footballer joining its Sky Max hit sports-based comedy panel series, A League of Their Own, as Team Captain.

With over 160 England caps and 27 goals, the statue shows Jill with her arms outstretched, commemorating the heroic moment she celebrated the 2-1 England victory against Germany at Wembley.

Jill Scott MBE said: "It's an honour to see this statue find its home at Gateshead College, a place that played a pivotal role in shaping my journey. I hope it inspires current and future generations of students to pursue their dreams with passion and determination and to never give up."

Suzanne Dunn, Service Director for Education, Schools and Inclusion at Gateshead Council, said: "It's fantastic to see the statue of Jill Scott find its permanent home in Gateshead. Jill is an inspiration for children and young people across the region, and students at Gateshead College will now benefit from the daily reminder that they can achieve their most ambitious goals by following in Jill's footsteps."

David Alexander, Principal and Chief Executive of Gateshead College said: "We're all immensely proud of our former student Jill, she's a real inspiration to our students and it's fantastic that Sky has gifted her statue to the college."

Barbara Lee, Commissioning Editor, Sky UK, said: "We know how much Gateshead College means to Jill, and we know how much Jill means to the whole team, both on and off camera, at 'A League of Their Own'. We're delighted to gift the statue created in her honour to the College for its students to enjoy."

The statue will now reside at its new home at Gateshead College, where it hopefully will inspire the next generation of sporting talent.
