Following a recently settled, tumultuous legal battle with previous label Hidden Beach — which found her countersuing the label’s claim that she exited halfway through a six-album deal last year — singer/songwriter Jill Scott has signed a distribution deal with Warner Brothers Records.

Scott is currently in the studio working on her upcoming album, The Light of the Sun, which is slated for an early summer release. While details about the set are still under wraps, the Grammy Award-winning singer gave fans a sneak peek of what to expect when she performed a track from the project during her 20-city national arena tour with Maxwell last year.

Scott is also a published poet, actress and designer (an intimate apparel line with Ashley Stewart). Her most recent film and TV credits include Tyler Perry‘s Why Did I Get Married Too, HBO’s The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, Lifetime Movie Network’s Sins of the Mother and NBC’s Law & Order: SVU. She also penned “The Moments, The Minutes, The Hours,” a 2005 compilation of poems published by St. Martin ‘s Press that became a New York Times bestseller.
