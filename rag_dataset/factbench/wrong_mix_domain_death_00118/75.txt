TIMES SQUARE — It's a small world after all.

A sprawling miniature world inspired by "Gulliver's Travels," Jonathan Swift's fanciful tale of a traveler who ends up a giant in a shrunken island of Lilliput — where the inhabitants are 6 inches tall — will open to the public this week featuring tiny recreations of scenes from the Big Apple to the Middle East.

Gulliver’s Gate will offer “an interactive display representing regions of the world and famous landmarks, as well as moving trains, planes, wagons and people of the past and present” when it opens for previews at 216 W. 44th St. on Thursday, a release said.

The 49,000-square-foot landscape includes scenes from New York City, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, Russia and Asia.

Visitors will be able to create tiny versions of themselves using a full-body scanner and 3-D printer that they’ll either be able to take with them or leave behind to become part of the exhibit.

The exhibit’s CEO launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for the project back in 2014.

The concept was inspired in part by Jonathan Swift’s novel "Gulliver’s Travels," artistic director Tim Gilman-Sevcik said in a video posted in 2015.
