Ben Gordon's $55m (Â£33.6m) five-year deal with the NBA's Detroit Pistons, sealed within the first 24 hours of the league's signing window, raises the possibility of him representing Great Britain in this summer's European campaign.

The London-born Gordon, 26, committed to playing for Great Britain two years ago but has spent the last two summers locked in contract negotiations with the Chicago Bulls, his former club. After re-signing to one-year deals in those two years, Gordon, the Bulls' leading scorer of the past four seasons of his five-year stint in Chicago, used his free agency status to sign with Detroit and end his partnership with Chicago's other British international, Luol Deng.

Gordon's availability would bring a boost to Great Britain in what is a crucial summer period for Chris Finch's team. Deng, whose performances in the past two years have been a major factor in qualification, is likely to miss the nation's first appearance in a European Championship finals in 28 years due to a stress fracture of the leg.
