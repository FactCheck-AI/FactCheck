Luol Deng won the NBA Battle of Britons when his Chicago Bulls side beat Detroit Pistons 92-85.

Team GB star Deng scored 14 points against a Pistons side that included London-born Ben Gordon.

Gordon left the Bulls in the summer as a free agent and was booed as he scored 18 points in this, his first game back in Chicago.
