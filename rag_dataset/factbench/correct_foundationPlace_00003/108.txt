Rocky Mountain University of Health Professions (RMUoHP) signed a lease for office space at 1800 Novell Place in Provo, Utah, which was originally constructed in 2000 as the headquarters for Novell. With the addition of two new residential programs over the next two years, the University is expanding its current footprint by adding 170,082-square-feet to its existing long-term lease of Building 3 on the Timpanogos Tech Center campus.

The 15-year lease includes the eighth and seventh floors, and half of the sixth floor, with the other half of the sixth floor and half of the fifth floor being added in spring of 2024. The University is currently working through the design process to remodel the space with an anticipated occupancy date of December 2022.

As a university, RMUoHP appreciates the efforts of the CBRE team of brokers, especially Tab Cornelison, who represented RMUoHP, as well as the Timpanogos Tech Center. Furthermore, RMUoHP looks forward to joining Microfocus as a fellow tenant in the tower.
