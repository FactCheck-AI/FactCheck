Lou Reed at Cleveland Music Hall in 1972

Lou Reed, born on March 2, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, was a seminal figure in the development of rock music. He co-founded The Velvet Underground in 1964, a band that, despite limited commercial success during its time, became one of the most influential groups in rock history. Known for his distinctive voice, poetic lyrics, and willingness to tackle taboo subjects, Reed’s work with The Velvet Underground, including albums like “The Velvet Underground & Nico” (1967) and “White Light/White Heat” (1968), laid the groundwork for punk, glam, and alternative rock. By 1972, Reed had left The Velvet Underground and embarked on a solo career. His self-titled debut solo album was released in April 1972, featuring contributions from prominent musicians. Still, it was his second album, “Transformer,” produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, released in November 1972, that catapulted him to greater fame with hits like “Walk on the Wild Side” and “Perfect Day.”
