Play songs by Lou Reed on your Uke

Lou Reed (born March 2, 1942) is an American rock artist originally from Brooklyn, New York. Especially while a member of the The Velvet Underground in the 1960s, Reed broke new ground for the rock genre in several important dimensions, introducing more mature and intellectual themes to what was then considered a largely simplistic genre of music. Reed first found prominence as the guitarist and principal singer-songwriter of The Velvet Underground.
