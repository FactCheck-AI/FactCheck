The Centre national d’art et de culture Georges Pompidou (CNAC-GP) is an établissement public national à caractère administratif (EPA) responsible to the ministry of Culture. An EPA is a public body to which the government has delegated, in whole or in part, the design and execution of a public policy. Benefitting from legal personality and financial autonomy, it receives a government grant that is supplemented from its own resources (admission charges, partnerships, sponsorship etc.); it recruits its own staff.

On the Centre Pompidou’s board sit government representatives, parliamentarians, the mayor of Paris, and other suitably qualified individuals, together with staff representatives.

The Centre Pompidou has been chaired by Laurent Le Bon since 19 July 2021.
