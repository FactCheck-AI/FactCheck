Late legendary superstar Sivaji Ganesan has two sons one of whom is the veteran hero turned character actor Prabhu who is still busy with his acting career. Similarly Ramkumar, Sivaji's eldest son, has also acted in a few films including 'I', directed by Shankar in which he appeared as the main villain.

Akshay Saran, managing partner of Chennai-Mylapore-based Dhanapakyam Enterprises, has filed a check fraud case against Sivaji's son Ramkumar grandson Dushyant and his wife Abhirami in the Saidapet court. In his petition, he had business dealings with Eason Productions, a company run by Dushyant's wife. Then in 2019, two checks of Rs.15 lakh were given on behalf of Dushyant both of which allegedly bounced.

The petitioner also sought action against Ramkumar who had undertaken to pay the amount on behalf of his son and daughter in law but failed to do so. A bailable arrest warrant has been issued by the court against Ramkumar, Dushyanth and Abhirami and the next hearing has been posted on February 14th 2023.

Another case relating to the Sivaji Ganesan family is also causing sensation in Kollywood. Sivaji's daughters Shanthi and Rajvi filed a case against their brothers Ramkumar and Prabhu accusing them of cheating them of ancestral properties and jewels.
