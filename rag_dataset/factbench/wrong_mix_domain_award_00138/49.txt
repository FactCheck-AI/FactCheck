The 2005 Nobel peace prize has been awarded jointly to the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency and its director, Mohamed ElBaradei.

The citation says the IAEA's director is a "fearless advocate" of curbing nuclear arms and the importance of his agency's work "incalculable".

The nuclear watchdog's work to promote safe nuclear energy was also commended.

Mr ElBaradei said the award recognised that the spread of nuclear weapons was the world's worst security threat.

Speaking at IAEA headquarters in Vienna, the Egyptian-born diplomat said he had learnt of the decision at home from live TV.

He began a third term at the IAEA last month after the US withdrew complaints that he was being "soft" on Iran.

Congratulating the prize-winners, the White House said the award underlined the importance of stopping nuclear weapons proliferation.

Ole Danboly Mjopes, head of the prize committee, stressed the award was not intended as a "kick in the shin" of any nation or leader but as a boost to disarmament.

'Policeman and salesman'

IAEA inspectors have had to deal with major crises in Iraq, North Korea and Iran in recent years as well as investigating the nuclear black market led by Pakistani scientist AQ Khan.

That the world has achieved little in this respect makes active opposition to nuclear arms all the more important today

The BBC News website's Paul Reynolds notes that Mr ElBaradei, 63, makes his impact with expert analysis while remaining a fair judge.

But critics accuse the IAEA of failing to prove conclusively whether or not Iran's nuclear ambitions are peaceful, among other things.

And opponents of nuclear civilian energy condemn the agency's parallel commitment to civilian atomic power.

In the words of Greenpeace International, Mr ElBaradei is both "nuclear policeman and nuclear salesman".

This year's contest saw 199 names put forward - a record number.

In keeping with tradition, it will be awarded in the Norwegian capital while the other Nobel prizes - for excellence in physics, chemistry, medicine and literature - are awarded in Stockholm.
