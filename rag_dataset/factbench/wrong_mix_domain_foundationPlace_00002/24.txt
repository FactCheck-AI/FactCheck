Rogue Wave Software announced that it has acquired Klocwork, a provider of software development tools for creating secure code. Ottawa, Ontario-based Klocwork offers tools that analyze source code on the fly, simplify peer code reviews, and extend the life of complex software, the company says. The addition of the Klocwork tools to TotalView and the OLEX open source scanning solution complements and expands the Rogue Wave solutions for developers, Rogue Wave announced in a press release.

“Rogue Wave has consistently provided market-leading frameworks and tools used by developers to enable software everywhere,” said Brian Pierce, CEO of Rogue Wave. “With the addition of Klocwork, we greatly enhance our customers’ ability to create secure and reliable code, while expanding our offering from the enterprise to the embedded development market. Klocwork’s innovative team and technologies are an incredible addition to the Rogue Wave family.”

Klocwork Insight is a source code analysis tool that integrates into a developer’s personal workflow on the desktop. It alerts developers to potential security vulnerabilities or reliability issues in real-time, as they are typing. Combined with Klocwork Cahoots, a code review platform, developers have solutions to assist with application security, source code analysis, code review, reporting and metrics, code refactoring and code architecture.
