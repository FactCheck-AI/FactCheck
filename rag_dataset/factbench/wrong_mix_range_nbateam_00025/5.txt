Sometimes, it can be difficult for NBA players to empathize with the fans. After all, they are playing in a league where the pressure to perform and win can be so immense that they must keep their focus on the court and not on the stands. However, former Chicago Bulls star Carlos Boozer was able to get a good idea of what fans are like during a recent visit to the United Center, where he caught the game against the visiting Philadelphia 76ers.

Loyalty to the Bulls

Boozer watched the game with his former frontcourt partner, Joakim Noah, and he was amazed by just how passionate the fans around him were. Regardless of how awful Chicago was playing against the Sixers at the time, the fans still cheered the team on and tried to keep up their spirits. This really struck Boozer, who was moved by the loyalty of the fans.

"These fans, they make whatever they make and they spend half their check to come watch the Bulls play. And when I realized that, I'm like, 'Yo they go so hard for us.' They're like real fans here man."

Four seasons with the Bulls
