The writing was on the wall here for Carlos Boozer after the Chicago Bulls signed Pau Gasol to a three-year, $22 million contract. Boozer was set to make $16.8 million in 2014-2015, the final year of his contract. While Chicago wipes a huge contract off its salary cap for the upcoming season, Boozer will still get that large sum of money from the team.

There is expected to be a nice amount of interest for Boozer on the open market. Considering that heâ€™s already set to make $16.8 million in 2014-2015, it makes little sense for the big man to seek a long-term deal at this point.

The Miami Heat and Houston Rockets have both been linked to the former All-Star.

Boozer, a former second-round pick of the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 13.7 points and 8.3 rebounds per game for the Bulls last season. It was his least productive campaign since his rookie year back in 2002-2003.
