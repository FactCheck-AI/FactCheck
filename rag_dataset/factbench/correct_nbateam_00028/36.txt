Basketball Hall of Famer Ray Allen, who spent five seasons with the Boston Celtics, has a new job.

The 46-year-old Allen, who left the Green for the Miami Heat in 2012, will now take up high school coaching in south Florida. Allen was named as director of both boys and girls basketball at Gulliver Prep, a co-ed private school in Miami-Dade County, where he'll serve as varsity coach for the boys team.

Allen, who is a parent at the school, previously spent time as an assistant coach for the middle school program there.

The news comes on the same day that Allen's former teammate with the Celtics, Kevin Garnett, will have his No. 5 jersey retired by the franchise on March 13 after a game against the Dallas Mavericks.

Allen's No. 20 jersey remains conspicuously absent from the rafters at the TD Garden.

Gulliver Prep is yet to produce an NBA player, although 2015 WNBA Finals MVP Sylvia Fowles is an alumna of the school. Former NFL safety Sean Taylor also graduated from the school.

Boston Celtics

In five seasons with Boston, Allen helped the Celtics win an NBA Championship in 2008 and played in another finals in 2010. He made three All-Star teams, averaging 16.7 points per game for the C's before taking his talents to South Beach and winning another title there.
