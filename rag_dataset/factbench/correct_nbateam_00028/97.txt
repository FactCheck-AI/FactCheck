The Boston Celtics are the defending Eastern Conference champions. Miami, if you want that crown you are going to have to fight them for it.

Ray Allen -- who made it official yesterday inking his deal to stay a Celtic -- said he and his teammates are ready to show Miami what team basketball looks like (as reported by the Boston Herald).

Of course, when Boston first got Allen -- the same year they got Kevin Garnett also to pair with Paul Pierce and form “the big three” -- it was the year they won the NBA championship. And with all due respect to Boston, the combination of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh has more raw talent.

So how is this different?

We’ll see if the big egos in Miami are ready to do the same (they did sacrifice money, but that is different). If not, Boston will remain the better team.
