Some 10 years after Heath Ledger suddenly died, his ex Michelle Williams has found love again. In July, the Oscar-nominated actress married the singer and songwriter Phil Elverum in an under-the-radar ceremony.

Elverum can relate to Williams: He lost his first wife to pancreatic cancer in 2016, when his daughter was only 18 months old. Williams also has a daughter, Matilda, whom she shared with Ledger. Matilda is now 13, and was just 2 years old when her father died.

According to a source, it took Williams some time to find a suitable companion after the tragedy. "She and Phil are a perfect match,” the source told Us Weekly. “She kissed a lot of frogs to get where she is now, but she doesn’t regret it one bit." Another source said, "Everyone knows how Michelle struggled after Heath's death. She didn't want to date for a while. She concentrated on being a great mom to Matilda."
