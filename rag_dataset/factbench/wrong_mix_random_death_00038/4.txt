Former Argentine tennis star David Nalbandian - who reached the Wimbledon final in 2002 - has been accused of secretly filming his ex-girlfriend after they split.

Nalbandian, 41, was one of the sport's elite stars in the 2000s, rising to as high as world No 3 in March 2006.

He won 11 singles tournaments and along with his appearance in the Wimbledon final 21 years ago when he lost in straight sets to Lleyton Hewitt, Nalbandian also reached the semi-final at least once in the other three Grand Slams.

However, according to German outlet BILD, Nalbandian is now embroiled in a scandal with his former partner Araceli Torrado, 29.

The report claims the Argentine - who was in a relationship with Torrado between September 2022 to June 2023 - installed a camera in the apartment the couple lived in in Palermo, Italy, after their split to continue monitor her.

When Torrado's brother visited the flat, he reportedly noticed a bizarre glow behind an air shaft before removing the cover and finding the camera.

The camera was installed in Torrado's bedroom, leaving the model and influencer in shock.

'The horror was indescribable: He not only watched me, but could also see me naked!', the report claims she said in the indictment.

She had originally reported Nalbandian to police immediately, but a lack of evidence saw the charges dropped.

However, Torrado and her lawyers persisted and showed audio recordings and messages which allegedly led to Nalbandian admitting to filming her.

Argentine newspaper La Nacion report that in a voice message the former tennis star allegedly said: 'Do you want me to be honest? Yes, I set up the camera.

'But I couldnâ€™t see anything because there were internet problems.'

The report goes onto claim Nalbandian is now facing charges of stalking and sexual harassment, with the 41-year-old likely to be sued by his ex-partner if found guilty.
