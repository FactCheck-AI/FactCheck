First Tuesday co-founder Adam Gold has sold his Silicon Valley internet business, Obongo, to AOL Time Warner for an undisclosed sum.

Mr Gold, one of the architects of First Tuesday's Â£33m takeover by an Israeli venture capital group, is understood to have closed a sale of the Redwood, California-based firm in the past few weeks.

Obongo was set up to take the frustration out of entering your personal and financial details when buying from e-commerce sites, by doing it for you automatically.

Mr Gold started the business with John Hunt, founder of London-based internet consultancy Syzergy. The exact value of the cash deal is unknown, but the pair have been stressing to friends that it was not a fire sale.

Neither Obongo nor AOL was prepared to comment.

The duo moved to Silicon Valley in April 1999 with the aim of building a blue-chip start-up which would be backed by the region's biggest players.

Their breakthrough came when they attracted Sequoia, the venture capital firm behind Yahoo!, Cisco and Oracle, as a founding investor. Atlas Ventures also took a stake.

It is thought that Obongo started looking for a buyer when the flow of venture capital into start-ups dried up at the start of the year.

AOL is expected to offer Obongo's technology as an add-on service to its 30m subscribers.

The three other co-founders of First Tuesday have gone their separate ways since the networking group was sold. Nick Denton is president of online information business Moreover.com which, with backing from Reuters, is moving towards profitability.

Julie Meyer runs her own venture capital firm but it is unclear what investments it has made. John Browning is working for an internet firm co-ordinating networking events in London.
