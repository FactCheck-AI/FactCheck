Frank Lloyd Wright's Wisconsin: How America's Most Famous Architect Found Inspiration in His Home State Summary America’s most famous architect,

Frank Lloyd Wright, was born in 1867 in the rolling hills of Richland Center, Wisconsin, to a family of Unitarians. Even with world-class commissions like New York City’s Guggenheim Museum, his organic architecture remains rooted in Wisconsin’s landscape, from affordable-housing prototypes in Milwaukee to his summer home and architecture school in rural Spring Green. This comprehensive guide to Wright’s designs (and those of his protégés) that are open to the public—as well as insider historical information about sites now demolished, and those available for “drive-bys” only—is for the architecture or history fan looking for tours, overnight stays or creative inspiration.
