Acronis Cyber Foundation was created from the cyber cloud company, Acronis. At the Acronis Cyber Foundation, we believe knowledge should be available to all. Throughout the last 15 years, we have built schools in underserved communities around the world, including Guatemala, Nicaragua, Nepal, Tanzania, and more. This year, we are raising funds for a computer class in our Guatemalan school so children have the opportunity to learn technological skills. 100% of all funds raised go directly to building and supporting these schools. We work with Acronis partners around the world to fund schools and provide support long term.
