The Acronis Cyber Foundation Program is a corporate social responsibility project by IT company Acronis.

To implement our philanthropic initiatives, we work with a vast network of non-profit organizations and government institutions.

The dedication and hard work of like-minded Acronis employees, partners and friends makes the projects organizationally and financially possible.

Since the programâ€™s start in 2018, we have been strongly focused on education. We engaged in school construction (implemented in partnership

with the Groundbreaker), IT skills training (in collaboration with Yellow Ribbon Fund, IMDA and Integres) and other

educational and humanitarian aid initiatives for children and adults.

To mark our fifth anniversary in 2023, we are expanding our focus also to include environmental projects.
