The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Site in Hodgenville is a significant location that was established to honor the life and legacy of former President Abraham Lincoln. The site preserves two farms where Lincoln spent his formative years, providing visitors with a glimpse into the early life of one of America's most influential figures.

Symbolic Birthplace Cabin

The main attraction at the Sinking Spring farm, one of the two preserved sites, is a log cabin. This cabin symbolizes the one in which Lincoln was born, providing a tangible connection to the past. Although research has indicated that the cabin is likely not the original birthplace of Lincoln, it still serves as a powerful symbol of his humble beginnings.
