What could it be like inside the mind of an artificial intelligence that has just evolved consciousness? Our guest today has imagined just that.

David Gerrold has written some of the most widely-read and -viewed science fiction of the last 60 years, starting with classic Star Trek's Trouble with Tribbles episode and several other episodes of that and other Star Trek, Babylon 5, Twilight Zone, and other TV series, plus novels such as The Man Who Folded Himself, and series including the War Against the Chtorr and the Dingilliad, winning the Hugo and Nebula awards for the noval The Martian Child.

We focused on his novel When HARLIE Was One, about an AI that became conscious, which develops (more thoughtfully than most such stories) how the interaction with the humans around him changed HARLIE... and them.

All this plus our usual look at today's AI headlines.
