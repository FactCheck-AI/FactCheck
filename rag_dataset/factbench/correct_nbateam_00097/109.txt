America's fastest growing youth basketball initiative is making some big moves in 2012: in size, giving, and now in stature. Released late this evening, HSBCAMPS announced that Chicago Bulls standout point guard John Lucas III, has become the organizations latest NBA staff acquisition. Lucas becomes the second active National Basketball Association player to join HSB's expanding staff in the last five days. Joining the likes of New Orleans Hornets forward Carl Landry and former Houston Rockets forward Mike Harris, Lucas will team up with HSBCAMPS staff of collegiate and professional players and coaches to mentor, train, and educate an up and coming generation of aspiring young ball players.

A solid contributor on this years Chicago Bulls roster, Lucas embodies the HSB brand of Hard Work, Sacrifice, and Belief that anything is possible, overcoming the odds and his critics, landing himself some long awaited job security in the NBA. Following a decorated collegiate career at Oklahoma State, Lucas went undrafted in 2005, and has spent the last seven years bouncing between NBA, D-League, and International rosters before finally making his mark in Chicago in 2011.

"John Lucas embodies what our program and our message is all about," shared HSBCAMPS Director Carson Sofro. "He is living proof that with some hard work, perseverance, and dedication anything is possible and we are ecstatic to have him on our staff for 2012 and beyond."

Joining former Houston Rockets Forward Mike Harris and the rest of the HSBCAMPS staff, Lucas will be in attendance when HSBCAMPS dribbles into New Braunfels, Texas June 7, 2012.
