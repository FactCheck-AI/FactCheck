HOUSTON â€” Former Florida point guard Jai Lucas says he will transfer to Texas.

Lucas is the brother of former Oklahoma State guard John Lucas III and was recruited heavily by OSU and by Oklahoma.

He signed with Florida and started all 36 games as a freshman but decided after one exhibition game before this season that he would leave.

He told Houston television station KRIV on Sunday that he chose the Longhorns.

Lucas averaged 8.5 points at Florida last year and led the Gators in 3-point shooting and was named to the SEC all-freshman team.

Lucas will have to sit out a season before becoming eligible to play.
