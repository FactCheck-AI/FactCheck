Catalyst will host a talk to celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the award to Charles Glover Barkla of the 1917 Nobel Prize for Physics. The talk will be delivered by Peter Rowlands, Honorary Teaching Fellow of the Physics Department at the University of Liverpool.

A hundred years ago, Charles Barkla received the Nobel Prize on Physics for work completed almost exclusively in the Department of Physics in the University of Liverpool. He was a local man, born in Widnes and the star graduate of Oliver Lodge’s department at the University of Liverpool.

Barkla made at least three outstanding discoveries which are still significant in today’s research. Come and listen to the talk to find out more!

The talk will take place at 2.30pm on Thursday 2nd November at Catalyst Science Discovery Centre. Admission is free of charge, please book through Event Bright via the link below.
