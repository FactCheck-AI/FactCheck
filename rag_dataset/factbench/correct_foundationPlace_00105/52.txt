In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, New Jersey-based sneaker shop Sneaker Room has designed a special Nike Air Pegasus 83/30. Only 31 pairs of the hot pink runners were made and each one will be auctioned off. ALL proceeds from the project will go towards the research and treatment of breast cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

The Pegasus runners were designed through NIKEiD by Sneaker Room and were individually numbered. There's also a special packaging and hangtag that comes with each sneaker. The sizes available are 8 - 14.

To participate in the auction, you can e-mail bc.sneakerroom@gmail.com with your shoe size and monetary bid on the subject line. The starting bid is $500. You must also include your full name and phone number in the body of the e-mail. The status of the auction will be updated via Sneaker Room's website and Instagram. The auction closes on October 31 at 8 p.m. EST.
