In this thread you have to recommend one book only for everyone to read.

I recommend "The God Delusion" by Richard Dawkins.

ANYONE WHO RECOMMENDS MORE THAN ONE IS A TWIT! :twisted:

Chicks In Chainmail ... Esther Friesner

EDIT: It is ONE book

P.S. I Blissfully claim Twithood, and Chick-ness.

I assume you're talking about LOTR.

Were you carrying it when someone fired an arrow at you, which luckilly hit the book and the thickness of the book saved your life?

In a 'slings and arrows of outrageous (mis)fortune' kinda way yes. I had to go and live there for a long time a few years back

Was that made into a movie? We had to watch a movie called Whit in my Philosophy of Death class a few years back.

My recommendation (way too many I want to recommend): The Death of Ivan Ilych - Leo Tolstoy

Don't think so. Wouldn't have been much use in that class, I shouldn't think.

Garfield.

No, no I'm jus joking! Forget what I said, I didn't say anything...

I recommend "The Birthing House". Gives you the shivers, that book and it's full of scary moments and an incredible climax. (Gotta read more. What happens next? Gotta read MORE!) I'll give you the author's name, when I find the book again... If I find the book again.
