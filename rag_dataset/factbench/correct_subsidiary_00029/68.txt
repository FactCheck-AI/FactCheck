MADE TO WIN: The Nexx X.R3R motorcycle helmet was designed using technology transferred directly from the racetrack.

The X.R3R lightweight shell design not only reduces the air resistance but also optimizes the air mass flow for cooling the interior. A translucent race-style spoiler extension can be added to further improve stability at high speeds.

Featuring a 225ยบ horizontal field, an 85ยบ vertical visual field, the 2-dimensional shape visor, made of unbreakable PC Lexan, optical class I and anti-scratch and is prepared for the application of tear-offs.

Anti-vibration rubber visor plates designed to absorb and evenly distribute vibrations reduce noise levels and canceling the transmission of vibrations. A double visor lock system prevents unexpected sudden opening of the visor and can be easily opened while wearing gloves.

The X.R3R is designed for demanding conditions on the racetrack, while providing comfort, safety and performance.
