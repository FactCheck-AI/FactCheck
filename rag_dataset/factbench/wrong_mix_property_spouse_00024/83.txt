Return of the Living Dead II (1988) synopsis: “Curious kids unearth the barrels that previously helped revive the dead, which proves the second time's an undead charm.”

Starring: Thom Mathews, James Karen, Michael Kenworthy, and Suzanne Snyder

Director: Ken Wiederhorn

Sure it might be the lesser of the two Return of the Living Dead movies that Thom Mathews starred in but Zak and Corey have a lot of love for RotLD2, and we think it shows! It definitely showed during our exclusive interview with Freddy & Joey (and Tommy Jarvis in Friday the 13th 6) himself, Thom Mathews! You can listen now at patreon.com/podcastingafterdark!
