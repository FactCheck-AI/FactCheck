Respected Malaysian journalist Abdullah Ahmad, editor-in-chief of the New Straits Times, sang the praises of Malaysia's new Prime Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, to fund managers, bankers and analysts at a seminar in Hong Kong earlier this month. Yet only a week later the man credited with reviving the New Straits Times was sacked by Badawi for a column criticising the regime in Saudi Arabia.

In the only jarring note during Badawi's first month in office since taking over from Mahathir Mohamad, Abdullah was dismissed after complaints from the Saudi Arabian government.
