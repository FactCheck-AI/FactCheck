The cover illo of Arkham House's 1986 Dreams of Dark and Light is Max Ernst's La grande foret.

Joachim Boaz has a whole blog post on Max Ernst appearances on SF book covers that is worth

checking out--in the comments people talk about other modern fine artists whose work has

appeared on SF covers.
