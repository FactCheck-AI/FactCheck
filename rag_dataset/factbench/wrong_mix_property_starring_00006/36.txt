Beatrix "The Bride" Kiddo (codename: Black Mamba) is a fictional character, the protagonist of the two-part movie "Kill Bill" directed by Quentin Tarantino. She is portrayed by Uma Thurman. Kiddo was ranked by Empire magazine as 23rd of "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters" of all time, and "Entertainment Weekly" named her as one of "The 100 Greatest Characters of the Last 20 Years".

According to Uma Thurman, the character was created collaboratively during the filming of "Pulp Fiction", with Thurman providing the character's first name and Tarantino her last name. After the release of "Kill Bill: Volume 2", Tarantino commented that he "loves the Bride" and that he "killed himself to put her in a good place" at the end of the two-part film.

Tarantino has said he saved most of The Bride's nuanced character development for the second half: "As far as the first half is concerned, I didn't want to make her sympathetic. I wanted to make her scary." Thurman cited Clint Eastwood's performance in "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" as a central inspiration for her performance because, in her words, Eastwood "says almost nothing but somehow manages to portray a whole character."
