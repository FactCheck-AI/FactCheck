It's all leading up to the ultimate confrontation with Bill (David Carradine), The Bride's former master and the man who ordered her execution! As the acclaimed follow-up to the instant classic Volume 1â€”you know all about the unlimited action and humor, but until you've seen Kill Bill: Volume 2, you only know half the story!
