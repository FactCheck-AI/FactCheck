The legacy of a renowned poet will be celebrated at an annual event at Shakespeare's Birthplace.

Rabindranath Tagore, who was born in 1861, was the first non-European writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The event on 5 May will be filled with performances and a ceremony to remember the writer, who was so inspired by Shakespeare that he wrote a poem in his honour.

It will mark Tagore's 163rd birthday, which has been celebrated since a sculpture of the poet was unveiled nearly 30 years ago.

Tagore was best known for being a poet but he also wrote national anthems for India and Bangladesh as well as being an educator and painter.

His most famous works will be played at the event by Indian musicians in a "Truck Art" bus on Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.

Bollywood and Bengali singer and actress Rowshanara Moni will also perform pieces inspired by Tagore during the celebrations.

"All are invited to experience and engage with Tagoreâ€™s extraordinary work through the form of Indian classical music," Jennifer Shufflebotham from Shakespeare's Birthplace Trust said.
