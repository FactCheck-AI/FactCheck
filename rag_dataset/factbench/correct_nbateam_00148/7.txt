“Tony will forever be one of the Core Four responsible for the turnaround in the Memphis Grizzlies’ fortunes and our surge in popularity,” added general manager Chris Wallace. “There would never have been seven straight years of playoff appearances, the incredible electricity in FedExForum for home games, ‘Grit and Grind’ and ‘Believe Memphis’ without Tony Allen’s contributions to the team.”

Allen was selected by the Boston Celtics as the 25th pick overall in the 2004 NBA Draft. He played six seasons in Boston and was a member of the 2008 championship title squad. Allen also played in all 24 playoff games of the 2010 season in which the Celtics reached the NBA Finals.

After that year, he signed a three-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies. Following his departure, Allen voiced that he had felt “kind of overshadowed” by Paul Pierce and Ray Allen. The guard went on to play seven seasons in Memphis and earned NBA All-Defensive first team honors during three of those years.

“Tony became more than just one of the toughest defenders in the league,” Wallace said. “He became a true cult hero who was intertwined with the soul of Memphis like few athletes ever have in any city.”
