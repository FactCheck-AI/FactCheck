Kim Kardashian insists that everything’s hunky dory with her new husband now, but that wasn’t always the case.

On the heels of rumors that her marriage is falling apart, the E! reality star opened up to People magazine about her not-so-rosy first days as Kris Humphries’ wife.

“It’s not ideal because you’re newlyweds and you want privacy,” she said in an interview featured in the latest issue of People, talking about the living with her new husband and sister Kourtney Kardashian, her boyfriend Scott Disick and their son Mason while filming the second season of “Kourtney and Kim Take New York.” If three’s a crowd, five sounds like a nightmare.

Sister Khloe Kardashian admits the gang takes some getting used to.

“It’s a tough crowd,” she told People. “I think it’s just a lot of transition.”

But now that Kim’s headed back to Los Angeles, her mom, Kris Jenner, is confident that her daughter and son-in-law will find a more hospitable living arrangement. “They’ll figure it out as soon as they get back,” Jenner told People.
