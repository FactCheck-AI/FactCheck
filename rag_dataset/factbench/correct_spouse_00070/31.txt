Kris Jenner knows how to shut down an argument. In the latest peek at this weekend's Keeping Up With the Kardashianspremiere, Kris finds herself at the center of a fam dispute over Rob Kardashian. The only way out? Bringing up that one time Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries were a married couple for an admittedly brief period of time.

"You should not be paying for your son that is almost 30 years old to buy a house," Kim tells Kris. "Drop him," Khlo√© Kardashian adds in support. "Cut. The. Chord." That, of course, is enough to inspire Kris to turn up the heat. "You guys can judge me all day long," Kris tells the fam. "I came here to have a nice dinner. So just everybody relax. You all have to have somebody to blame and criticize instead of saying, 'What's the problem?'"
