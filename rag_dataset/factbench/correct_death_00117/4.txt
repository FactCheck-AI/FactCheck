This is the tomb of James Knox Polk, the 11th president of the United States, and his wife Sarah Childress Polk. He died in 1849, and was buried in this tomb in 1850. However, at the time, this was on his residence, Polk Place, but in 1909, was moved to the grounds of the Tennessee State Capitol hill. Polk Place was then torn down and the area became a YWCA. When the tomb was first built, old photos show the black description at the top with "10th" before the word "President."
