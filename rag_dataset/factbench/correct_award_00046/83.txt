Abstract

The Statue Within: An Autobiography is a seemingly candid reflection of the life and work of the French Nobel laureate, François Jacob. In 1965, he and his research partners (Jacques Monod & André Lwoff) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for their discoveries concerning genetic control of enzyme and virus synthesis. Nobel Prize recipients are required to provide an autobiographical statement, which can be found on their website (http://www.nobelprize.org). When comparing these two autobiographical works, one finds radical differences in structure and content. I examine here how Jacob approaches the following elements in each work: passage of time, his involvement in World War II, and his family.
