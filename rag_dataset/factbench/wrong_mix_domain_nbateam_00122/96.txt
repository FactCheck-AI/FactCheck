New York native Metta World Peace is throwing his own hat into the ring to be the next New York Knicks head coach.

Metta World Peace knows New York as well as anyone. On Tuesday, the New York Knicks fired David Fizdale. World Peace took to Twitter to lobby the New York Knicks for a chance at the head coaching gig.

He offered up some kind words for Fizdale before talking about his basketball exploits in New York City, and specifically when he was with St. John’s.

“First I want to give a shoutout to Coach Fiz,” World Peace said. “You deserve it, you put in work, you know what I mean? I watched you over the years.”

The former Knick didn’t waste much time before going into his pitch to Knicks brass.

“I heard the Knick job is open and I heard Mark Jackson might get it, which I’ll be happy about. You know, St. John’s, Queens, love the guy. But, you already know I’m from the block and I chose St. John’s for a reason, fighting for New York City. The same reason a lot of people chose St. John’s.”

World Peace continued to reminisce on his days as a young basketball player in NYC. Obviously, the artist formerly known as Ron Artest is probably not going to be a realistic candidate for head coach, but he mentions former Knick and St. John’s legend Mark Jackson.

Although Jackson has a checkered past as a head coach, he’s a New Yorker through and through. It’s way, way, way too early to know what direction the head coaching search will take, but it’s not too early to speculate about Jackson’s name being heavily linked to the gig.
