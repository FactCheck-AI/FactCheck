Metta World Peace isn’t unemployed anymore. And he isn’t headed to China to play for Yao Ming’s team.

World Peace agreed to a two-year deal with his hometown New York Knicks on Monday afternoon. The deal is reported to be worth $1.6 million per season, and it includes a second year player option. World Peace was amnestied by the Los Angeles Lakers last week, and he cleared waivers yesterday, which made him available to other teams in the league.

After he was amnestied, talks of World Peace retiring came up. There was also the tweet sent out by World Peace himself, saying that he would like to join former teammate Yao Ming’s professional team in China. But it appears World Peace couldn’t pass up the opportunity to play with his hometown franchise.

World Peace will look to inject some toughness and defensive tenacity into the Knicks lineup.
