NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- Metta World Peace hasn't even stepped onto the court at Madison Square Garden and he's already giving Knicks fans something to talk about.

The Knicks recently signed World Peace, and the speculation around NYC was that with a new city, there would be a new name change. Some thought that the 6-foot-7 forward would go back to Ron Artest now that he is back in his hometown.

The Queens native decided to go in a different route.

While he will not legally change his name, he will be deciding on a new nickname before the season starts.

"I'm not going to legally change my name until my career is over," World Peace said during a video interview with ClevverNews. "But we are going to do do a name change, but I can't tell you what it is."

The 33-year-old changed his name to Metta World Peace in 2011. Knicks fans will still see "World Peace" on the back of his jersey, but they will have the chance to supply the former Los Angeles Laker with his new nickname, as World Peace announced on Twitter on Friday:

The Knicks and World Peace agreed to a two-year contract on July 15.
