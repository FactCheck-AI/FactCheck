Birth and Parentage

Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington was born on 29 April 1769 at Mornington House, 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland. He was the son of Garrett Wellesley, 1st Earl of Mornington and the Hon Anne Hill-Trevor. He was baptised at St. Peter's Church, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland. [1]

Marriage and Family

He married the Hon Catherine Sarah Dorothea Pakenham, daughter of Edward Michael Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford, and Catherine Rowley, at St. George's Church, Dublin, County Dublin, Ireland. [2]The exact date is in dispute. FamilySearch gives marriage bond and license data as 1806. Wikipedia and other internet sites claim they married on 10 April of that year, probably quoting Citizen of the World' in The Military and Political Life of Arthur Wellesley. [3] However, on Wednesday 16 April 1806, the Belfast Commercial Chronicle reported that

Sir Arthur Wellesley will shortly set out for Ireland, where he will lead the Hon. Miss Pakenham, sister to the Earl Longford, to the hymeneal altar.[4]

The Annual Register of World Events reported that they married on (Sunday) 20 April. [5] The Bury and Norwich Post - on Wednesday 23 April 1806, stated that they had married on the previous Thursday (17 April). [6]The Staffordshire Advertiser on Saturday 26 April 1806 says they married on Thursday 24 April.[7]

Arthur Wellesley was an Anglo-Irish soldier and statesman. He rose to prominence during the Peninsular War and became a national hero in Britain after the Napoleonic Wars, during which he led the victorious Anglo-Allied forces at the Battle of Waterloo. He would later be elected Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on two separate occasions.[8]

In 1851, aged 81, widowed, he was living at Apsley House, St George's Hanover Square, London, United Kingdom. [9]

On Wednesday evening , the 10th November, at seven o'clock, the Remains of the late illustrious deceased were privately removed from Walmer Castle, in a Hearse drawn by four horses, attended by an escort of the Rifle Brigade, and followed by three Mourning Coaches, each drawn by four horses, in the first of which were the Marquess Douro (now Duke of Wellington ), Lord Arthur Hay, and the Captain of Walmer Castle ( John J. Watts, Esq .); in the second, Thomas Charles March, Esq., Chief Clerk of the Department of the Lord Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household; and in the third, Mr. Kendall and Mr. Collins, servants of the deceased: Minute Guns were fired from the ramparts of Walmer Castle whilst the Procession moved from thence to the Station at Deal. From the Station the Body, attended by the Marquess Douro and the other persons who had followed in the Mourning Coaches, was conveyed by Special Train to London, arriving there at twelve o'clock; and thence, being followed as before, the Body was conveyed under an escort of Life Guards to Chelsea Hospital, where, about three o'clock in the morning of Thursday the 11th, it was received by Norman Hilton Macdonald, Esq., Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Department, and by a Guard of Honour of the 2nd battalion of Grenadier Guards, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel the Honourable James Lindsey, and a similar Guard of Honour, furnished by the brigade of Foot Guards, mounted daily, until the Remains were removed.

Transcription:

"WELLESLEY, ARTHUR, first Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), field-marshal, was fourth son of Garrett Wellesley, first earl of Mornington[q.v.], by Anne, eldest daughter of Arthur Hill, viscount Dungannon. He was born in 1769, less than four months before Napoleon. There is some doubt about the exact date and place of his birth. His mother gave 1 May as his birthday, and he himself so kept it, but the nurse affirmed that he was born on 6 March at Dangan Castle, co. Meath. The registry of St. Peter's Church, Dublin, shows that he was christened there on 30 April 1769, and the May number of 'Exshaw's Gentlemaan's Magazine' has: 'April 29. The Countess of Mornington of a son.' The 'Dublin Gazette' of 2-4 May dates the event 'a few days ago , in Merrion Street.' On the whole the evidence points to 29 April, and to 24 Upper Merrion Street, Dublin (Notes and Queries, 4th ser. x. 443, 7th ser. xi 34: MURRAY, Wellington: the Date and Place of his Birth)."
