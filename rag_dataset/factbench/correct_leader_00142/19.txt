FOR a man who has just led his country off a constitutional cliff, Baburam Bhattarai, Nepal's Maoist prime minister, seems remarkably relaxed. Squeezing Banyan in for an interview in his Kathmandu office on June 9th, he is about to head off to grace a convocation at a medical college. So it is business as usual, despite the legal vacuum his government has inhabited since the term of a 600-member elected Constituent Assembly (CA), which also served as the parliament, expired at midnight on May 27th. So ended its abortive four-year effort to agree on a new constitution. As midnight neared, Mr Bhattarai called an election for a new CA, to be held in November. He was prime minister when the music stopped, so has remained in the post.
