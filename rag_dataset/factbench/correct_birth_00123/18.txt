Michael Jordan is a former professional basketball player from the United States, considered by many to be the greatest basketball players of all time. He was born Michael Jeffrey Jordan on February 17th, 1963 in Brooklyn, New York, to Deloris Peoples, a banking employee, and James R. Jordan, Sr., an equipment supervisor. Michael was the fourth child of five born to his parents, and has two older brothers, an older and a younger sister. He attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, North Carolina, where his family had relocated to when he was just a toddler. Although he played sports in school, he was actually turned down for the varsity basketball team in his sophomore year for being too short. A four inch growth spurt and training changed all that.
