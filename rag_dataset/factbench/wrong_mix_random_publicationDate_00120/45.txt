Kelly McGillis, who stole Tom Cruise's heart in Top Gun and Harrison Ford's in Witness, joined Melanie Leis in a civil union in New Jersey, RadarOnline.com has learned.

The ceremony took place Wednesday at the Collingswood Municipal Court.

The twice-divorced actress announced she was a lesbian just last year although it had long been known in show business circles.
