Delta Hospital holds a special place in the hearts of local philanthropists Steve and Susan Blake.

In the past six years, they have donated over $100,000 to the Delta Hospital Foundation, with their latest $75,000 gift completing the $7.5-million capital campaign to expand the hospital's diagnostic services department.

The Blakes' personal experience with the care at Delta Hospital has helped shape their giving. Steve's first wife, Elizabeth, passed away from cancer in 2009 at Delta Hospital. Steve felt she received first-rate care with staff making sure she was comfortable during her final days, and wanted to make a meaningful and lasting contribution to the hospital and community.

"We are so privileged to receive Steve and Susan's heartfelt gift to Delta Hospital," says Lisa Hoglund, individual giving manager for the hospital foundation. "The Blakes are such admirable members of our community, and care dearly for our hospital. Their generous donations show their commitment to exceptional healthcare for all those that live in Delta."

Until retirement, Steve was a teacher and secondary school vice-principal in Vancouver and Susan was chief physiotherapist at Burnaby Hospital. They have committed many hours to volunteering and both were volunteers with the RCMP, Steve as auxiliary constable for 24 years and Susan for eight. Susan

was also an executive member of Hip Hip Hooray, a charitable organization raising money for orthopedic patients. A number of charitable organizations have benefited from the Blakes' generosity as they have donated over $250,000 in the last six years to causes they are passionate about.

In particular, they are dedicated to supporting those who have suffered hardships beyond their control and organizations

that support children and animals. They have contributed to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, B.C. Professional Firefighters' Burn Fund, B.C. Children's Hospital, Cops for Cancer, Animal Advocates of B.C. and a number of others.
