Kill Bill v2 (2004) was the sequel to the enormously successful Kill Bill v1(2003) movie which also starred Uma Thurman as The Bride; David Carradine as Bill, Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, Lucy Liu as O'Ren-Ishii, Vivica Fox as Copperhead and Michael Madsen as Budd.

Though Kill Bill v1 seemed much more of a traditional swordplay, kung fu action film, Kill Bill v2 seems to combine the traditional swordplay movie with a spaghetti western film, and even a love story. The relationships between the central characters are more evident in this film than in its prequel.
