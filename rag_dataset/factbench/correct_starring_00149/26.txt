Directed by Tim Burton // Rated PG-13

A scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp) but dies before he can finish, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder) and attempts unsuccessfully to master basic human hygiene.
