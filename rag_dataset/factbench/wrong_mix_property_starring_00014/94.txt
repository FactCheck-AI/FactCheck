Love Actually is one of the most iconic Christmas films known to man - Rowan Atkinson's iconic cameo, Professor Snape in a rom-com and of course, THAT Hugh Grant dance scene.

Another iconic star who appeared in the Christmas romcom classic, alongside Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley and Colin Firth, was Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who was just 13 at the time. But what many fans don't realise is that he is Hugh Grant's cousin, reports the Telegraph.

Thomas has revealed how he told Hugh that they were related while on the set of Love Actually. He said: "He didn't know. I said, 'Apparently, you are my uncle or my cousin or something'. Then he kind of remembered my mum and uncle. So for the rest of the shoot, he went round saying, 'Hello cousin'. That felt quite cool."

The actor, now 32, has followed in the footsteps of his superstar relation, finding roles in Game of Thrones, The Queen’s Gambit and the Maze Runner franchise.

He told This Morning: "It's a strange life to lead as a young person, it was a life I loved, a life of adventure, and I kept somewhat grounded and relied on my friends and family. I'm still riding the wave."

Hugh Grant played the newly elected prime minister in Love Actually, a role famous for his dance scene around Number 10.

More recently, he was Guy Richie’s The Gentleman and played a number of iconic roles over the years in Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones’s Diary and Notting Hill.
