Oscar Emmanuel Peterson was a legendary Canadian composer and jazz pianist. Born in the neighbourhood of Little Burgundy in Montréal, Québec on August 1925, Oscar Peterson died of kidney failure on December 2007 in Mississauga, Ontario.

Oscar Peterson is considered to have been one of the greatest jazz pianists of all time, having played thousands of live concerts to audiences worldwide in a career lasting more than 60 years.

We found his headstone while visiting Saint Peter's Anglican Church Cemetery in Erindale (Mississauga) on a waymarking excursion around Toronto. It is located at the beginning of the cemetery, just behind the church.

His gravestone reads:

He lived and loved with joy and passion

Dedicated to God, music and excellence

Loving father

Cherished and devoted husband of
