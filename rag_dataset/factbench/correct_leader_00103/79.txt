Iraq’s Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari arrived in Morocco on Monday on an official visit that will last several days.

The foreign minister was received and met with top government officials in Morocco and key on the agenda was terrorism, a common enemy plaguing the two Arab nations.

“If the world had stopped terrorism in Syria at the beginning , there would be no terrorists in Iraq or even Libya. We must be cognizant of the fact that terrorism is affecting most nations in the world,” Minister Jaafari said.

He is also expected to meet the Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Ben Kieran and House Speaker Rachid Talbi Alami.

Jaafari will discuss bilateral relations between Baghdad and Rabat, as well as the prospects of joint cooperation .

The two countries hope to work on reactivating a joint committee created in 2012 by the business community in Morocco and Iraq.
