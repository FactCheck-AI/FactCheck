North of Okemah a few blocks on Woody Guthrie Blvd (which turns into N3770 Rd) is Highland Cemetery. The cemetery contains the graves for Woody Guthrie's family: his sister, Clara Edna (who was burned to death in 1918), and Woody's parents, Nora Belle and Charley Edward Guthrie.

Woody Guthrie also has a grave marker at Highland (even though he was cremated and his ashes spread at Coney Island). Guthrie's marker is engraved with the words "Bound For Glory," and a self-portrait cartoon drawn by him.
