Kidnapped relatives of former Miss USA Ali Landry have been found dead in Mexico, authorities said.

Juan Manuel Gómez Fernández and Juan Manuel Gómez Monteverde are the father and brother of Landry’s husband, acclaimed Mexican film director Alejandro Monteverde, according to CNN affiliate Televisa.

Monteverde and Landry, who represented Louisiana in the 1996 pageant, married in 2006 and they have three children.

The slain men were found Saturday in Veracruz, according to a statement from that state’s attorney general. They had been reported kidnapped on September 4. Initial investigations suggest that both men suffered head trauma, the statement said.

Landry declined through her representatives to comment.

Many months ago, the actress’ husband posted a picture on Instagram of him and his father.

“Celebrating in San Miguel de Allende, with my best friend, my life mentor, the wisest man I know; my father,” he wrote then.
