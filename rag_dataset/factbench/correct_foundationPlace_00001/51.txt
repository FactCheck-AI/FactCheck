What lessons can one take away from the success at Springline? Mainly that we view our relationships with tenants as true partnerships as opposed to just a landlord thinking about rents and projected revenue. In this day and age, where the market is soft, you need to be pushing the envelope on that dynamic in order to differentiate yourself. We wanted Springline to feel like being in a large resort without being at an actual resort. In order for that to work, the relationships between landlord, the residents, office tenants and restaurant partners has to be symbiotic.

Rather than a full-service restaurant, the idea is “something a little bit more irreverent, fun and informal,” Kuzia-Carmel said.
