Former Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon has tied the knot in a secret ceremony in Barbados.

The former Miss Northern Ireland wed William Corrie after eloping.

The 36-year-old told Hello! about her private nuptials at the exclusive Sandy Lane beach resort, which boasts A-listers like Rihanna and Oprah Winfrey as fans.

It is also the resort where golfer Tiger Woods got married in 2004.

She said: "I can't wait to get home and tell everyone. I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.

"We'll have a big party when we get home, I'm sure of that."

She added: "I want an excuse to wear my dress and feel the magic again."

Revealing her wedding details exclusively to Hello!, she disclosed her dress of choice was a beaded gown with a long train from wedding designer, Berta.

"When I saw Zoe arrive I thought, 'Wow!"'William said of seeing his bride in her dress.

She added: "What was so lovely was that every single conversation we had that day was with each other.

"It was really intimate and we had so much space to breathe and take in every special moment."
