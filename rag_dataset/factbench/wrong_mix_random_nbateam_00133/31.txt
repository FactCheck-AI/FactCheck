The former 'Blue Peter' presenter tied the knot with partner William Corrie - who she got engaged to last November - in Barbados last week and kept their plans so secret that even her parents didn't know about the nuptials.

She said: "I can't wait to get home and tell everyone. I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.

"They ran off to Bournemouth and didn't tell anyone and my sisters went to Mauritius and Antigua, so they will understand."

But the couple - who have been together for five years - will be celebrating with their loved ones when they return to Northern Ireland.

She added: "We'll have a big party when we get home, I'm sure of that. I want an excuse to wear my dress and feel the magic again."

Zoe admits she had felt "pressure" to have a big wedding back home but was too busy to plan anything elaborate, so opted to go abroad to the place where William had popped the question on his 30th birthday.

She said: "We explored various options and there are some beautiful castles and weddings we have been to.

"I was under a lot of pressure from friends to have a big wedding, but we couldn't decide and were so busy with work that we hardly had a chance to see each other, never mind find time to plan a wedding.

"It was William's suggestion to get married in Barbados and he had managed such a wonderful surprise engagement here that I thought, yes, that's perfect."

The 36-year-old presenter is now excited to set up home with William for the first time.

She told HELLO! magazine: "We have been together for five years but we are Christians so didn't believe in living together until we were married.

"This is the most exciting part for us. We kept saying to our minister back home that the wedding would be lovely but we were so excited to be married."
