Zoe Saldana and her husband Marco Perego left their baby twins at home to celebrate her mother's 59th birthday on Saturday night. The couple joined Zoe's family at Hakkasan restaurant in Beverly Hills on a rare appearance since they welcomed their twins in November.

The actress posted a picture of the celebrations on Instagram which showed her looking happy while Marco stands with his arms wrapped around her.

"Good times at my mom's 59th. Might as well be 69 at the drinking speed these old farts are headingâ€¦ I kid I kid @HakkasanBH", she wrote.

According to a source, the new parents appeared truly loved-up as they enjoyed their night out with Zoe's family.

"They were super sweet with one another," a source told Us Weekly. "[They were] holding hands under the table, and talking to the family members about their new babies."

Zoe and Marco welcomed their twin sons on 27 November. The 36-year-old kept fans guessing on the boys' names until January, when she revealed the names and thanked fans for their well-wishes, along with a picture of their baby bottles.
