Bill Murray and Kelis are seeing each other as per reports. The 72-year-old Ghostbusters actor is reportedly dating the 43-year-old Milkshake singer. Murray was seen last weekend at the Mighty Hoopla festival in London watching Kelis' performance. The couple even posed for a picture backstage, though they haven't publicly admitted their relationship. Additionally, they have apparently been becoming closer since connecting in the United States because they were reportedly seen at the same hotel in London.

Kelis was previously married to Nas, however their marriage ended in 2009.She claimed in 2018 that Nas had physically abused her during the course of their five-year marriage, but Nas has since refuted this. Mike Mora, Kelis' second husband, passed away in March 2022 from stomach cancer.

Bill Murray's first marriage lasted from 1981 to 1996 to Margaret Kelly, and his second, from 1997 to 2008, to Jennifer Butler. Butler died unexpectedly in 2021 at the age of 57.
