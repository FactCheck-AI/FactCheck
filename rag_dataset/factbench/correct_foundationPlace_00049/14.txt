Join the FSF's Copyright and Licensing Associate Donald Robertson for a member gathering on Friday, November 11th, in Seattle, Washington. We'll be providing appetizers (including vegan options), mingling, and talking about free softwareâ€“related issues. All ages are welcome and the restaurant is wheelchair accessible.
