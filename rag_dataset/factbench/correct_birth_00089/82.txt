Canada's biggest-selling rock star is saying thanks to the Eastern Ontario hospital where his life's journey began.

Bryan Adams had his name inscribed on a plaque at Kingston General Hospital, where he was born in November 1959. His family moved from Kingston when he was a toddler

Adams received the honour Thursday night before his concert at the K-Rock Centre. The rocker is lending support to the hospital's $2.5-million expansion.
