Isaac Bashe­vis Singer was a Pol­ish-born Jew­ish-Amer­i­can author not­ed for his short sto­ries. He was one of the lead­ing fig­ures in the Yid­dish lit­er­ary move­ment, receiv­ing numer­ous awards and hon­ors for his work. In 1978, Singer was award­ed the Nobel Prize in Lit­er­a­ture. A pro­lif­ic writer, the main theme of Singer’s works is the clash between tra­di­tion and renew­al-preser­va­tion ver­sus regen­er­a­tion-which serves as a back­drop to sto­ries delv­ing into the grip of human pas­sions that unleash the destruc­tive, yet also con­struc­tive, force of the emo­tions. Singer’s pro­found tal­ent allowed him to man­age these weighty top­ics with a light, often comedic, touch.
