Two years later, Fegan and the whole gang returned for the musical sequel "Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam" (Disney Channel, 2010), which found the reunited crew in direct competition with the well-funded snobs across the lake at Camp Star. Also that year, Fegan joined the regular cast of the hit family sitcom "Shake It Up!" (Disney Channel, 2010-13) as Ty Blue, the talented older brother of Rocky Blue (Zendaya), an aspiring dancer who, along with gal pal Ce Ce (Bella Thorne), chased fame and fortune on a popular Chicago dance-music program. The entrepreneurial Fegan also formed his own recording label, 3inaRo Entertainment, through which he co-wrote and produced his first EP I Am Ro Shon. In 2012, the young performer extended his exposure to an older demographic when he joined the cast of the 14th season of the reality competition "Dancing with the Stars" (ABC, 2005-), under the guidance of dance pro Chelsie Hightower.By Bryce Coleman
