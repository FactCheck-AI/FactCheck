CNCNETPDM AT THE ORACLE VALUE CHAIN SUMMIT | PRESENTATIONS

TOP

By Martin Wieland: At the Oracle Value Chain Summit in San Jose (CA) I presented CNCnetPDM as part of Oracle's 'Analytics Driven Manufacturing' concept explained by Stephen Slade (Senior Director, Manufacturing, Industry Solutions Marketing, Oracle).

In an expert panel together with Manish Modi (Vice President, Manufacturing and PLM, Development, Oracle), John Shimp (Director, Manufacturing, SUN Oracle) and Mark Wu, (GE Appliances) I could show how data from highly diverse shopfloor devices can be extracted, converted into compareable data packets and seamlessly be integrated with Oracle's Manufacturing Operations Center.
