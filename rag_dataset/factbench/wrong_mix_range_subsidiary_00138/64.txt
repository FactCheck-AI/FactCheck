In 1989, architect Bruce Taylor, AIA, founded Summit Design in Park City, Utah. Since, Summit Design has developed a reputation for creating unique architectural design solutions specific to the client and to the setting. Summit Design’s residential architecture ranges from luxury mountainside ski-in, ski-out designs to subsidized housing and small living communities. These designs seek to incorporate principles from the “Not-So-Big” housing movement, evident in the carefully planned functional and multi-use spaces scaled for the daily pleasures of life. The designs honor the site and conform to the cycles of nature in their passive solar orientation; attention to prevailing winds; window sizing and placement for views, privacy, light and air circulation; placement of outdoor living spaces; and landscaping for the benefit of framing views both of the residence and from the residence.
