New Delhi:

Milind Soman, who mostly shares pictures from his workout diaries, posted something different on Friday. The actor shared a photo of himself and his wife Ankita Konwar sleeping in what appears to be their balcony. Alongside his post, Milind also shared a note about "laziness." He wrote: "Laziness is a natural instinct. In pre-historic times when danger would be lurking constantly, we would need to conserve energy to be used only when necessary, say to hunt, gather food or flee. And even though we are supremely safe today, even outdoors, in the lap of nature, it is nice to give in sometimes!"

To all of you wonderful people out there, and to my sweetheart and best friend Ankita Konwar, run with me forever, thank you for your love. Happy Friendship Day!"
