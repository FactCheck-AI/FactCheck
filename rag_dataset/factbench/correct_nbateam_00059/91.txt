Los Angeles Lakers guard Steve Blake will be sidelined for at least three weeks after puncturing his left foot on a spike strip in a parking garage.

The Lakers announced Blake's injury Monday.

The veteran point guard will be held out of any impact exercises for about three weeks. Los Angeles opens training camp next Monday, Oct. 1, with its first preseason game Oct. 7.

Newly acquired centre Dwight Howard also won't be participating immediately in Lakers camp while recuperating from off-season back surgery.

Blake is expected to be Steve Nash's backup this season. Blake averaged 5.2 points and 3.3 assists last season for the Lakers in his second season with the club while primarily backing up Derek Fisher and Ramon Sessions.

Blake is heading into his 10th NBA season.
