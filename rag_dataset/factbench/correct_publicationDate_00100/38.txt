A Little Book about the Big Bang is a must for anyone interested in a clear account of how the universe grew up into the starry wonder we witness today. -- Paul Halpern, author of <i>Flashes of Creation: George Gamow, Fred Hoyle, and the Great Big Bang Debate</i> Modern cosmology tells the fascinating tale of the evolution of the universe. Tony Rothman is our thoughtful guide, always careful to distinguish established science from speculative theory as we explore the fundamental nature of the big bang. -- George Ellis, author of <i>How Can Physics Underlie the Mind?</i> Tony Rothman's book beautifully explores some of the biggest questions that humanity has pondered for centuries. A Little Book about the Big Bang highlights the cutting-edge work being done by cosmologists, who in recent decades have made extraordinary progress toward revealing the secrets of our universe. Read this book-you will be inspired. -- Neta Bahcall, Eugene Higgins Professor of Astrophysics, Princeton University A remarkably comprehensive account of modern cosmology. Rothman emphasizes what we confidently know about the big bang, but also provides insight into the important unanswered questions in the field, taking us to where the deep puzzles lie. -- Michael Strauss, coauthor of <i>A Brief Welcome to the Universe</i>
