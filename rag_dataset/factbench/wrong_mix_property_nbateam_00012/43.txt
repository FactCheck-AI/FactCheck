Just how good was Boston Celtics champion big man Kevin Garnett as a player? The recently inducted Hall of Famer won a title with the Celtics, the NBA’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 2004, and earned 15 All-Star nods, missing only two seasons between 1997 and 2013.

Add nine All-NBA teams and an All-Rookie second-team honor as only a sample of his accolades, and you might start to get a picture. But what does that tell us about how good a player he actually was? The subject of more than a few heated arguments in this vein, the host of the CLNS Media podcast “Basketball Time Machine” tackles this evergreen question.

Watch the video embedded below to see host Sean David’s take on how good of a player The Big Ticket was over the course of his career.
