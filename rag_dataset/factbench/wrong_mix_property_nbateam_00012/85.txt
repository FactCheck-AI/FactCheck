ESPN Boston, Chris Forsberg

Garnett earned 26 points with 2 first-place votes, 9 second-place votes, and 7 third-place votes. New York's Tyson Chandler won the award with 311 points (45 first-place votes), while Oklahoma City's Serge Ibaka finished second at 294 points (41 first-place votes). Orlando's Dwight Howard (186 points) and Miami's LeBron James (112 points) joined Garnett in rounding out the top 5.

Personally, I think Chandler definitely deserved the award but Kevin Garnett definitely deserved to be in the top five. Also, Avery Bradley earned two third place votes and finished 14th in voting. I have a feeling he will rise up that list if he keeps playing at the level he did this season over the next few years.

Garnett won the award in 2008, and 2012 was almost definitely his greatest season in Boston since.
