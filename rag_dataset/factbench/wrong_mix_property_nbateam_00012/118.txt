Now officially ensconced in basketball Valhalla, Boston Celtics champion center Kevin Garnett has rightfully been honored with the sports’ highest recognition, ahead of which he gave a speech for the ages to look back on his career as a player.

The former Celtic, Minnesota Timberwolf, and Brooklyn Net gave a wide-ranging induction speech that chose to focus on the many positives in his professional journey across three franchises and 21 seasons in the league. An NBA champion, league MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Olympic Gold medal winner among many other honors, The Big Ticket is part of a historically strong class inducted this weekend that includes Tim Duncan and Kobe Bryant.

Watch KG’s induction speech in full in the video embedded below; while it might not have taken place in the Hall itself in this pandemic-haunted year, Garnett’s achievements will forever be honored within it.
