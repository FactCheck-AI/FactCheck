Charlton Heston, who won the 1959 best actor Oscar as the chariot-racing “Ben-Hur” and portrayed Moses, Michelangelo, El Cid and other heroic figures in movie epics of the ’50s and ’60s, has died. He was 84.

The actor died Saturday night at his home in Beverly Hills, family spokesman Bill Powers said. He provided no further details.

Heston revealed in 2002 that he had symptoms consistent with Alzheimer’s disease.

With his large, muscular build, well-boned face and sonorous voice, Heston was an ideal star for panoramas depicting the religious and historical past. “I have a face that belongs in another century,” the actor, who liked to cite the historical figures he had portrayed, often remarked.

He served as president of the Screen Actors Guild and chairman of the American Film Institute and marched in the civil rights movement. Later, he campaigned for conservative candidates.

In June 1998, Heston was elected president of the National Rifle Association, and in 2003 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He lent his strong presence to some of the most acclaimed and successful midcentury films. “Ben-Hur” won 11 Academy Awards, tying with “Titanic” (1997) and “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (2003). Other hits included: “The Ten Commandments,” “El Cid,” “55 Days at Peking,” “Planet of the Apes” and “Earthquake.”
