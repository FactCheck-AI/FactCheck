After weeks of speculation, Chris Brown has confirmed the news that is sure to break your heart: He and Rihanna are no longer a couple. In an interview with the Kyle and Jackie O Show on Australia's 2day FM, he offers this really-tough-to-decipher explanation: "Yeah, Imma do it [that is, celebrate his birthday yesterday] solo, I mean at the end of the day Shawty [Rihanna] doing her own thang, she on the road ... it's always gonna be love ... I'm a grown man, just gotta fast forward."

And also: "I'm always gonna love that person. I can't be focused on wife-ing someone that young. I need to be the best Chris Brown I can be." Best we can figure, someone is too young to be getting married, we're just not sure who. Of course, this is the same radio station that disastrously prank-called Kate Middleton's hospital, so perhaps take this news with a grain of salt. Radar has audio. (More Chris Brown stories.)
