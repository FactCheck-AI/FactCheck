Cole Porter’s birthday is June 9 and to celebrate his life and legacyâ€”and bring in some tourist dollarsâ€”folks in his hometown are working to turn his birthhome into a museum and bed and breakfast.

The Cole Porter Festival takes place from Friday, June 9-Sunday, June 11, 2006, in Peru, Indiana. It is sponsored by the Miami County Historical Society.
