One of the most celebrated writers in American literature, William Faulkner became widely know upon his acceptance of the 1949 Nobel Prize in Literature, for which he became the only Mississippi-born Nobel winner. Awarded for "his powerful and artistically unique contribution to the modern American novel", Faulkner donated part of his Nobel money "to establish a fund to support and encourage new fiction writers", eventually resulting in the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction.
