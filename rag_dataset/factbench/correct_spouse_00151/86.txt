Former EastEnders star Jill Halfpenny has revealed that she is pregnant with her first child.

The actress, 32, who played Kate Mitchell in BBC One soap, is due to give birth in May.

Halfpenny's husband, actor Craig Conway, told the Daily Mail: "I can't wait to be a dad, I'm very much looking forward to the birth of our baby, it's such an exciting time.

"We haven't asked its sex because we'll be happy either way."

After leaving EastEnders, Halfpenny went on to star in Waterloo Road, and won series two of Strictly Come Dancing in 2004.
