Ahead of next Friday’s release of the big-screen adaptation of the Mean Girls musical, Reneé Rapp and Megan Thee Stallon have dropped the video for “Not My Fault,” their collaboration from the film’s soundtrack, out today.

The video features the rapper and actress/singer (in character as Regina George, the film’s antagonist) performing the track interspersed with footage from Mean Girls: The Musical, one of Rolling Stone’s 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2024.

Megan Thee Stallion first teased the collaboration back in December ahead of Rapp’s performance at TikTok’s live music event, In the Mix. “What’s up y’all? It’s Megan Thee Stallion, aka the Black Regina George, and I’m excited to introduce my girl to the stage,” the rapper announced in an Instagram video. “We have a new song coming out for Mean Girls. That’s right, give it up for the new fantastic plastic, Renee Rapp.”

The single arrived on December 15, a month before Mean Girls: The Musical’s January 12 release. “Not My Fault” is one of the new (or not from the Broadway musical) recordings to feature on the soundtrack; the single itself won’t be incorporated into the musical, serving as a bonus for the companion album.
