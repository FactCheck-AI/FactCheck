History[]

Adobe Systems was founded in Mountain View on December 19, 1982 and had its headquarters located on Charleston Road. However, Adobe co-founder Charles Geschke was kidnapped from the company parking lot on May 26, 1992 and held for ransom for 4 days before being freed by the FBI.[2] In a separate incident on September 5, 1992, Adobe engineer Laurie Houts was found murdered less than 2 miles from the company's offices. Adobe has since relocated to San Jose and the surrounding area in Mountain View is now home to the campus headquarters of Google.[3][4]
