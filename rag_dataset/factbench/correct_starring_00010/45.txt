Ah.. Christmastime. Time to sit down in front of the TV with a big box of Quality Street and put on the ultimate Christmas romcom that we love to hate. But as it turns out, the storyline we all despise the most was infuriating for one of the actors too.

Love Actually haters will (unfortunately) remember the scene where Harry (Alan Rickman) leaves his wife Karen (Emma Thompson) to buy a very expensive bit of jewellery for his true love interest and secretary Mia (Heike Makatsch).

Although he'd managed to buy the gift for Mia, Harry was left frustrated when shopping clerk Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) attempted to wrap his present with unnecessary items, wasting his precious time.

But Love Actually director Richard Curtis said Alan was just as annoyed during the scene as his character.

He said: “Rowan was just taking his time. So he would do 11-minute takes. [Rowan would say], ‘Let’s go back and do that. Let’s start again.’ And poor Alan was there all the time going, ‘Grr, ugh.’”

So there you go. Turns out it's not just exceptional acting from the Harry Potter legend, but genuine frustration.
