Personally, I don’t want a lot for Christmas, but there is, however, one thing I need… and that’s to watch Love Actually on my screen.

Richard Curtis’ beloved 2003 romantic comedy is a holiday favorite. Starring Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, Laura Linney, and Liam Neeson, this feverishly adored film centers on eight couples dealing with all the ups and downs of love during a frantic December in London, England.

Last year, Love Actually was on Peacock during the holiday season, but where can you stream this rewatchable Christmas movie in 2023? Is Love Actually on Netflix, Hulu, or Max? Decider’s got your back. Here’s everything you need to know.
