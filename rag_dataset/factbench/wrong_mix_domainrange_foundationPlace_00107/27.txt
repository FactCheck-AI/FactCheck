LimeWire, a former peer-to-peer file-sharing platform turned into an NFT marketplace, created a new retro game! The game brings back the memories of downloading music with cryptocurrency rewards.

The Transformation of LimeWire

Developed by Mark Gorton in 2000, LimeWire was mostly used for downloading and disseminating illegal content, especially music files. According to estimates, more than one-third of all PCs worldwide had LimeWire installed as of 2007.

U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood issued an injunction on October 26, 2010, directing LimeWire LLC to stop “the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or distribution functionality, and/or all functionality” of their program.

Currently, LimeWire is an NFT marketplace, and it has no connection with its former team or platform.

On April 13, a throwback music-downloading game with a Windows XP theme was released on Web3, bringing back the once-famous music-downloading platform that was extremely popular in the first few years of the 2000s. By providing cryptocurrency rewards, the game can additionally bring in a younger audience interested in cryptocurrencies.

LimeWire’s entry into the world of games could turn out to be a wise choice as the NFT market grows larger, as it tries to position itself as a top platform and membership site for the creation of content.

How To Play LimeWire’s Retro Game?

Firstly, players must enter their emails to play the game. They can select which songs from early 2000s they want to download from the simulation’s catalog within a set time window. Players receive 10 points for each download that doesn’t have a virus in it. People can access the game until May 15.

The most successful players will get cryptocurrency rewards in the form of LMWR tokens which will go on sale in the coming days.

The top 1,000 players will each receive “merch packages” and an overall amount of 150,000 LMWR, which shall be distributed among them in a hierarchical manner.
