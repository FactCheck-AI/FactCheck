The back-to-the-basket, banger-type big man is still en vogue in the NBA despite the league-wide acceptance of floor-spacing biggies. Zach Randolph is proof to that, as the Memphis Grizzlies power forward is generating a relatively high amount of attention for someone who's about to turn 36.

According to a tweet by NBA.com's David Aldridge, Randolph was scheduled to meet a number of teams Friday night, including the Sacramento Kings and the Los Angeles Clippers.

Randolph's prospect of landing a roster spot in Sacramento is an intriguing one, as he could reunite with old coach, Dave Joerger. Joerger guided the Grizzlies in most of Randolph's time with the team. Sacramento could use a veteran presence for their young squad from an experienced and still-productive big man like Randolph, who could help mitigate the impact of DeMarcus Cousins' loss from last season.

As for the Clippers, having Randolph should give the team a very formidable frontline that already features Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan. Randolph played 39 games for L.A. back in the 2008-2009 season.

At his age, Randolph is unlikely to sign an eight-figure a year contract, but he's going to have a significant role to whichever team he represents next.
