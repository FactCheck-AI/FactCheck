9:46pm:Â Also interested in Randolph are the Cavaliers, Aldridge tweets. They’ll speak over the phone on Saturday.

8:14pm: Veteran big man Zach Randolph will meet with a host of teams in Los Angeles tonight, David Aldridge of TNT tweets. The Kings, Thunder and Clippers are all said to have an interest in the forward.

After a 2016/17 campaign in which he starred off the bench, Randolph’s role with MemphisÂ appears to be dwindling. At the beginning of last season, his eighth with the Grizzlies, the club opted to start JaMychal Green ahead of him.

Still, despite the move to the bench, the soon-to-be 36-year-old remained productive, posting Â Per 36 numbers of 20.7 points and 12.1 rebounds.

The veteran forward will have a number of options available, depending on how he plans to play out the twilight of his career. While the Grizzlies would almost certainly welcome him back in a small role at a reasonable price, he could also be coveted as a mentor for teams with young big men or as a valuable reserve piece for a contender.
