Former NBA All-Star Zach Randolph is heading to the BIG3.

The 38-year-old reached an agreement to play for the Trilogy and serve as team captain, the league announced.

The Trilogy will also be led by first-year head coach and former NBA veteran Stephen Jackson.

Randolph last played in the NBA during the 2017-18 season with the Sacramento Kings.

The power forward averaged 16.6 points and 9.1 rebounds across 17 campaigns in the Association with the Kings, Memphis Grizzlies, Portland Trail Blazers, New York Knicks, and Los Angeles Clippers.

His imposing physical presence and low-post dominance played an instrumental role in shaping the "Grit and Grind" era of the Grizzlies during the 2010s.
