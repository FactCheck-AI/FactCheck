Altovise Davis passed away on Saturday (14Mar09) at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after suffering a stroke.

Davis worked during the 1960s as a chorus-line dancer in various musical shows both in London and New York theatres.

She met Davis Jr. in 1967 while they were both working on Golden Boy on Broadway, and they wed in May 1970.

In the 1970s and 1980s Davis made several guest appearances in major U.S. TV series such as Charlie's Angels and CHiPs.

The couple adopted a son, Manny, and remained together until the Sammy Davis Jr. died of throat cancer in 1990 at the age of 64.

After his death, his wife was left to sort through his multi-million dollar tax debt and oversee his troubled estate. Last year (08), she sued two former business partners in federal court, claiming they tricked her into signing away the rights to the estate. The suit is pending.

Davis is survived by her son.
