A second person has died after a crash on the A16 between Peterborough and Crowland last month.

The driver of a silver Ford Fiesta, 33-year-old Andrew Jackson, was involved in a collision with a silver Kia Sorento at about 18:10 GMT on Friday, 24 November.

Mr Jackson, of Manwick Road in Felixstowe, Suffolk, was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for treatment but died on Saturday.

The passenger in the Sorento, 79-year-old Eleanor Joy Williamson of Silkstone Common near Barnsley, south Yorkshire, was pronounced dead at the scene.

She left behind a husband of 57 years, three children and six grandchildren, her family said at the time.

A 79-year-old woman from the Spalding area of Lincolnshire, who was driving the Sorento, suffered serious injuries and remains in a critical condition at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Anyone with information about the collision has been asked to contact Cambridgeshire Police.
