Five years ago, in Luke Ridnour’s final season in Seattle, he played with future hall of famer Kevin Durant. While a reunion with Durant is unlikely, Ridnour could soon call another expected hall of famer a teammate: New York Knick Carmelo Anthony. The Knicks are one of several teams with interest in the Minnesota Timberwolves guard, according to a league source.

Long-time NBA reporter Chris Sheridan is reporting the Wolves are expected to move guard Luke Ridnour. Utah likes Ridnour, according to a source. But a separate source said the Jazz are not willing to deal guards Alec Burks and Raja Bell for Ridnour. In fact, Burks is off-limits in the discussions involving Ridnour. The most logical scenario involves Utah sacrificing the worse of its two first-round picks in the June draft — the Jazz also owns Golden State’s selection — and Bell for Ridnour. Bell has an expiring contract. The Wolves don’t appear to be involved in any blockbuster trade talks.

Luke Ridnour is being shopped by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and a league source told SheridanHoops.com “there is a good chance” the 10th-year point guard will be dealt before the Feb. 21 trade deadline. With Ricky Rubio back from an injury that wiped out the first half of his season, the T-Wolves have a glut at the position with J.J. Berea also under contract (for this season plus two more). Ridnour has a reasonable contract ($4 million this season, $4.3 million next season) and is a steady playmaker who has spent the majority of his career with bad teams, having appeared in the playoffs just twice.
