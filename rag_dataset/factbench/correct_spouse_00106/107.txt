When she was not filming One Tree Hill in Wilmington, North Carolina, Lenz lived in Battle Ground, Washington with her husband Michael Galeotti - whom she married in December 2005.

In February 2011, Lenz announced the arrival of their daughter, Maria Rose Galeotti, and a year later made the unexpected announcement that she would be divorcing her husband. Lenz released the following statement, "you'll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me "Bethany Joy Lenz" again. I'm sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce. We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time."
