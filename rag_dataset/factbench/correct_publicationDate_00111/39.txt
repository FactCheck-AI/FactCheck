About the book:

The Glass Bead Game is an ultra-aesthetic game which is played by the scholars, creamed off in childhood and nurtured in elite schools, in the kingdom of Castillia.

The Master of the Glass Bead Game, Joseph Knecht, holds the most exalted office in Castillia. He personifies the detachment, serenity and aesthetic vision which rewards a life dedicated to perfection of the intellect.

But can, indeed should, man live isolated from hunger, family, children, women, in a perfect world where passions are tamed by meditation, where academic discipline and order are paramount?

This is Hermann Hesse’s great novel. It is a major contribution to contemporary philosophic literature and has a powerful vision of universality, the inner unity of man’s cultural ideals, and his search for personal perfection and social responsibility.

The cover, designed by Germano Facetti, shows a detail from ‘Constructiv-impressiv, 1927’ by Paul Klee.
