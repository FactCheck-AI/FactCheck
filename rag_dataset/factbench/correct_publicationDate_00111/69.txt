A well-known book by the German-born Swiss writer Hermann Hesse ‘The Glass Bead G ame’ has inspired innovator Martins Jansons to come up with Bead Game which is now getting more popular as it tries to bring together the digital world without losing the charm of playing a physical board game.

The novel that inspired modern game is final work by German author Hermann Hesse. Book was published in Switzerland in 1943 after being rejected for publication in Germany due to author’s anti-Fascist views. In 1946 author won the Nobel Prize for Literature.
