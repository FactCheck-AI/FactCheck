With Isight… …the development period was reduced to two days. “ Isight took us down a path we had not foreseen and gave us the confidence to keep an open mind about design. If we hadn’t been using the software, the most effective cone geometry would have never been considered.” Jeff Williams Project Engineer, Baker Hughes
