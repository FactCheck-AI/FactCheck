Mirnyi is a man to watch out for at Flushing Meadows - and not just because he is known as "The Beast".

Ranked number one in the world in doubles, Mirnyi has the kind of attacking game that can prove highly effective on hard courts.

At 6ft 5in, it is little wonder he possesses a huge serve, but the 26-year-old from Minsk can back it up with good volleys and impressive athleticism.

And it all came together 12 months ago when he made it through to the last eight at the US Open, beating Roger Federer before going down to Andre Agassi.

Mirnyi collected his first title in February of this year, beating Federer again in the semi-finals of the Rotterdam Indoor event.

Quarter-final appearances in Washington and Montreal, where he beat Lleyton Hewitt, suggest he is coming to New York in good form.
