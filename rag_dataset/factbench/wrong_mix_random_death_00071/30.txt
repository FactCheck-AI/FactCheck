GALLERY: John Lennon and Yoko Ono Through the Years

John Lennon and Yoko Ono were married on March 20, 1969.

The couple’s nuptials famously took place in Gibraltar. They followed them up with their infamous “Bed-In For Peace” honeymoon. The “Bed-In” honeymoon was in the Presidential Suite of Amsterdam’s Hilton Hotel and lasted a week. Both events were immortalized in The Beatles track “The Ballad of John and Yoko.”

Despite his murder in 1980, the marriage of Lennon and Ono remains one of rock’s most timeless couples and love stories. Few couples had their bond, and fewer have had it since. In honor of their wedding anniversary, scroll through the gallery below of classic images of Lennon and Ono through the years, including photos from their wedding and honeymoon.
