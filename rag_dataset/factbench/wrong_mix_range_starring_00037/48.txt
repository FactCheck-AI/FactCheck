Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John have apparently been persuaded to help turn the amplifier up to 11.

Rob Reiner has revealed that he has recruited the two legendary, and real, British musicians to star in a sequel of his much-loved 1984 satire, This is Spinal Tap.

The original film, starring Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer as members of the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap, has become one of the most cherished productions in both Britain and the United States.

It regularly appears in lists of top 100 films and 20 years ago was deemed “culturally, historically and aesthetically significant” by the Library of Congress.
