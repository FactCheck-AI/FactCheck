The Camp Rockers have returned, and no one's more excited than Mitchie (Demi Lovato) and love-interest Shane (Joe Jonas), who are looking forward to a summer of making music and having fun with their friends. But when big-money, state-of-the-art Camp Star opens across the lake, it lures away many instructors and campers - putting the future of Camp Rock in jeopardy. Mitchie emerges as a leader determined to save the camp and challenges Camp Star to a Final Jam - an end-of-summer performance duel. May the best camp win!
