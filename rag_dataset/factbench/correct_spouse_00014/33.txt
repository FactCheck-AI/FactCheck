This weekend was a legendary one for random celebrity weddings.

Perhaps the most random of ’em all: Krista Allen and Mams Taylor!

George Clooney’s beautiful ex-girlfriend, an actress with dozens of notable credits from soaps to movies to borderline soft porn, and the British rapper made it official.

MEET MISTA: Mams and Krista are married!

Mams, who gossip readers may also remember as the guy who cold cocked Jesse Metcalfe for moving in on his girl back in the day, confirmed it on Facebook.

“10.10.10 was a beautiful day I will remember forever! My wife and I got married in a ceremony with just her mom and son (step son-Jake) and my nephew!”

“So HAPPY and GRATEFUL! Bigger celebration to follow!”
