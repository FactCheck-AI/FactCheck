Since 1987, the California State Archives has been the repository for the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) invesitgation files of the assassination of Senator Robert F. Kennedy. An agreement between the Secretary of State and the City of Los Angeles transferred the investigation records (including documents, photographs, audio tapes, videotapes, and evidence items collected by the LAPD) in the possession of the City to the State Archives. This transfer occurred under the authority of Government Code 12226, which states:

With the consent of the Secretary of State, the governing body of a county or city may by order or resolution direct the transfer to the Secretary of State for inclusion in the State archives, of official items it deems have historic interest or value, and which are in the custody of any officer of the county or city.

The Guide to the Los Angeles Police Department Records of the Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Investigation (PDF) provides detail about the contents of the collection.

Guides to this collection can also be found on the Online Archive of California.
