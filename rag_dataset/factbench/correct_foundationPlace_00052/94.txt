As the world enters into the second year of living with the COVID-19, half of the global student population is still affected by full or partial school closures. It has created the most severe global education disruption in history. At the peak of the crisis, UNESCO data showed that over 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries were affected.

As a result, educational institutes had to hastily turn to e-learning, where teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. It become a catalyst for governments worldwide to transform their education system into online teaching.

Even before COVID-19, there has been high adoption of education technology, with global edtech investments reaching US$18.66 billion in 2019 and the overall market for online education forecasted to reach US$350 billion by 2025. Due to the pandemic, there has been a significant surge in the use of innovative technological solutions powered by artificial intelligence providing improved opportunities for student interaction and collaboration, support interactive digital classrooms and easily adopted by students and educators alike.

Prioritising education recovery is crucial to order to build more resilient and inclusive education systems whilst at the same time avoiding a generational catastrophe. School closures also threaten progress made towards gender equality, and also cut access to vital services for protection, nutrition, health and well-being.

This Programme will explore:

Lessons learnt, risks facing education and how technology has impacted the global education market.

New trends, opportunities and challenges for policymakers, educational institutions and other stakeholders to harness technology to improve and transform education system.

The need to counter existing learning gaps as well as inequalities and the risk of increased dropout.

Partnerships between educational institutions, technology and media organisations.
