Donna Summer died of lung cancer but her condition was "not related to smoking," according to a statement released by her publicist today.

"Although she lost her battle to lung cancer at the age of 63, it was not related to smoking," the statement said. "Ms. Summer was a non-smoker. Obviously, numerous factors can be attributed to the cause of cancer in general, but any details regarding the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of Ms. Summer's case remain between her family and team of doctors."
