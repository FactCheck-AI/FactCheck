NEW YORK — Donna Summer’s funeral will be a private one for family and close friends.

Publicist Brian Edwards said in a statement Friday that Summer’s family is overwhelmed and appreciates the outreach from fans and friends, but that her funeral services will remain private.

He didn’t provide details on when and where services would be held.

Summer died Thursday morning of lung cancer at age 63 in Naples, Fla. Edwards also said that the singer did not smoke.

Summer earned the title of Queen of Disco after releasing a string of dance hits in the 1970s, including “I Feel Love,” “Love to Love You Baby” and “Last Dance.”
