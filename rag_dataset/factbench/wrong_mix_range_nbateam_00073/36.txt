Mike Dunleavy Jr., a former 15-year NBA player who began his career with the Warriors from 2002 to ’07, will be the team’s next general manager, according to a report by ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski.

After retiring as a player in 2017, Dunleavy joined the Golden State franchise as a scout in 2018, and has been climbing up the front office ranks, and was promoted to vice president of basketball operations in 2021.
