A classic of Polish literature, an honorary academician of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, Henryk Sienkiewicz was a brilliant historical novelist. Like Hugo, Dumas, Tolstoy, he was able to describe the great events of past eras, paying attention to the personality of the person who created these events. In 1905, Sienkiewicz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature with the wording "For outstanding services in the field of the epic." “Kamo come” is his most famous novel, the action of which develops over the last four years of the reign of Nero (64 - 68 AD), during the formation of Christianity and the first acts of the apostles. Against the backdrop of historical events that forever changed the face of Western civilization, Sienkiewicz tells the tragic love story of a Roman aristocrat for a Christian persecuted by the authorities.

For the first time in Russia, the novel Kamo Gryadeshi comes out with drawings by the remarkable Czech artist Ventseslav Cerny.
