"The Gabo Foundation, an institution created by recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, Gabriel García Márquez, announces the 50 nominees for the twelfth edition of the Gabo Prize. The main award for journalistic works in Spanish and Portuguese recognizes the best references of quality, rigor and contribution to the strengthening of democracy and a free and better informed citizenry.

This selection of nominees came from a process in which the 2,170 works nominated in the five categories of the contest -- Audio, Coverage, Photography, Image and Text -- were evaluated by an independent jury made up of 77 internationally-renowned journalists, photographers and writers, coming from all corners of Latin America."
