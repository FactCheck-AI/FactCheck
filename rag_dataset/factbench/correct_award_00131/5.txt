Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez will have part of a street in downtown Winnipeg named after him for a few years.

A block of Graham Avenue from Smith to Donald streets will bear the honorary name Gabriel Garcia Marquez Way for a period of two to five years.

Considered one of the most popular Spanish-language writers of his generation, Garcia Marquez was best known for his works of fiction, which include the novels One Hundred Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera.

He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982, with organizers hailing "his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts."
