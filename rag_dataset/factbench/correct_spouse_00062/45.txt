Shanna Moakler has revealed “never” meeting his ex Travis Barker's wife Kourtney Kardashian and their seven-month-old baby boy Rocky.

Travis Barker, 48, with whom Moakler shares two children, tied the knot with Kardashian, 45, back in 2022.

However, Moakler revealed that despite the fact that she hasn’t met the reality star or the baby boy yet, her kids “love” their father’s other family.

“They said that he's beautiful, and yeah, they're all happy. They're good. So that's all I care about.”

She also made clear that she has never exhibited negative feelings for her ex or his new wife over their relationship with her children.

“I think people think I was angry,” she added. “But I'm not angry. It wasn't anger. I think I get maybe frustrated, but I'm also from the East Coast and I swear a lot and I can be very direct sometimes.”

“And I think some people take that as anger where I'm just very real where I'm like, ‘F*** the family.’ I don't have to f***** like the family. And it's like, there's people that don't like it.”

Moakler was married to Barker from 2004 to 2008 and welcomed son Landon, 20, and daughter Alabama, 18, with her ex. She also has a daughter Atiana De La Hoya, 25, with ex Oscar De La Hoya.
