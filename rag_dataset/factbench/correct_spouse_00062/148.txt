Rita Ora's new boyfriend Travis Barker reportedly still lives with his ex-wife despite their on/off relationship coming to an end a few years ago.

The Blink-182 drummer has a "toxic on-off relationship" with former spouse Shanna Moakler, whom he has 11-year-old son Landon and daughter Alabama, nine, and still resides at their Â£2 million marital home in Los Angeles with her.

A source told The Sun newspaper: "Travis and Shanna still live together and still care about each other immensely. She's been seeing other men but Travis can't let her go."

Friends of the former couple believe the 39-year-old rocker - who recently gushed about the X Factor judge - may be "using" Rita, 24, whom he started dating last month, to make the former Playboy model jealous.

The insider explained: "Pals think Travis is using Rita to get under Shanna's skin and make her jealous. He will always love Shanna. They get into cycles of declaring their undying love but somehow it always ends up badly."

The source added: "He's told friends he thinks they'll end up together even though they've divorced, reunited and split on more than one occasion."

The turbulent couple got hitched in 2004 but split and filed for divorce just two years later.

However, the separation was short-lived as they rekindled their romance a few months later, until things ended again in 2007 and their divorce was finalised in February 2008.

The pair attempted to reunite in January 2009 but their relationship came crashing down once again three months later, amid reports they'd been arrested following a fight.

Meanwhile, Rita and Travis have been "inseparable" since they met and hit it off at the Power 106 All-Star Game in Los Angeles, California two weeks ago, and the RIP hitmaker has reportedly even been introduced to his children.
