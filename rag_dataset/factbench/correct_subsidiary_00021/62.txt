Database giant Informix has announced plans to split its business into two separate companies over the next year as poor financial results have led the firm to issue a profits warning for its third quarter results.

The first of the new companies, Informix Software, will focus on the company's traditional stronghold of database software, and will continue to account for 85 per cent of future business. The second company, to be named later this year, will focus on databases for web publishing, ecommerce and business intelligence. This subsidiary will also support databases from rival groups IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and Sybase. Both companies will initially be wholly owned Informix subsidiaries, but there are plans to turn both into independent, publicly traded firms. Informix has forecasted a third quarter profit loss of between five and eight cents per share for the period ending 30 September 2000. Excluding restructuring costs, the company is expected to break even in the fourth quarter of 2000 and return to profitability in the first quarter of 2001. The news underlines the ongoing problems faced by former database giants that held a seemingly unassailable position in the market during the 1990s.
