The Connection Manager is a utility that can monitor the workload and status of database servers in high-availability clusters, Enterprise Replication domains, grids, and server sets.

Connection Managers can control failover for high-availability clusters, direct client connection requests to appropriate database servers, act as proxy servers to handle client/server communication, and prioritize connections between application servers and the primary server of a high-availability cluster.

For more information, see Connection management through the Connection Manager.
