Friends,

I have some very exciting news to share with you today. I am very pleased to announce that IBM and HCL are entering a strategic partnership to jointly develop and market the IBM Informix family of products.

We are building on a history of collaboration between the two companies. The new partnership combines IBM’s large Informix customer base and global sales force with HCL’s leadership in the IT services sector – accelerating the investments, evolution and adoption of Informix as a leading database – and further address the needs of an embedded database.

Effective May 1, 2017, HCL will take over development and support of the Informix product family. Product strategy, marketing and sales efforts continue to be led by IBM with HCL participating and expanding routes to market. Experience for customers remains unchanged. Existing customer agreements, first point of contact, new licenses or extensions to existing entitlements continue to be through IBM.

Let me close by expressing again my personal excitement about this new partnership as it will lead to new innovations, more delighted clients and more opportunities for our employees and partners.
