How much of travel is rubbernecking at places where people died? (Hello: Gettysburg, Tower of London, Ford’s Theatre…) Seattle’s own death site is Viretta Park, a 1.8-acre patch in Madrona. Kurt Cobain lived next door, hung out on these benches, and committed suicide a few dozen feet away.

The A.V. Club’s Pop Pilgrims travel series paid a visit to what’s known—even on Google Maps—as Kurt Cobain Park. Thousands visit every year to remember the grunge god and leave graffiti on the park benches, annoying the neighbors. The A.V. Club’s take:

Are you a bad person for wanting to see where Kurt Cobain died? And not just died, but violently took his own life after a long, sad battle with depression and drug addiction? Short answer: No. Longer answer: No, as long as you don’t trespass or misbehave.

Kurt only lived in the fancy mansion for a few months before taking a trip to rehab, then returning and shooting himself there in 1994. Kurt apparently slept in the closet while he lived at 171 Lake Washington Blvd East next door, uncomfortable with his new deluxe life.
