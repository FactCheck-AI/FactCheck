From the critically acclaimed team that created New York’s Free Shakespeare in the Park’s production of Merry Wives (as seen in HBO documentary Reopening Night)! Berkeley Rep presents the world premiere of an exuberant new musical by award-winning playwright Jocelyn Bioh (School Girls; Or, The African Mean Girls Play) and composer Michael Thurber, conceived by director Saheem Ali.

A mysterious singer arrives at Moto Moto, a steamy Afro-jazz club in Mombasa, Kenya. She casts an entrancing spell on everyone, including a young man who has returned home from studying in America. Will the big plans for his life — stepping into a political legacy and marrying his fiancée — be upended?

Inspired by the myth of Marimba, the Goddess who created beautiful songs from her heartbreak, this is a rousing tale of romance, the supernatural, and the quest towards one’s truest self.

Produced by special arrangement with No Guarantees and Mara Isaacs.

Reviews

“Berkeley Rep’s Goddess is well on its way to the heavens.

Goddess finds fulfillment and riches from the fact that love happens at all — that it can make us unselfish, even for one fateful moment.

Amber Iman can throw her blue moon voice so that it seems to have a center of gravity outside her body.

The cast members, under the direction of Saheem Ali, who also first conceived of the show, gush talent.

The most stunning achievement of the world premiere is that in promising a goddess of music, it delivers.”

“Joyful...a uniquely entertaining creation of musical magic and dancing dynamics.

It’s hard to know who to praise first: Michael Thurber’s sensational African, Jazz, and R&B music and lyrics, choreographer Darrell Grand Moultrie’s fusion of hip hop, modern, African, and street dance, or the troupe of singers and dancers who make the music and dance come alive.

Goddess succeeds in delighting its audience.... Don’t wait too long to get tickets.”
