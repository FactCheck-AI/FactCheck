Curtis Mayfield, one of America's most influential singer-songwriters, died Sunday in a Georgia hospital.

Mayfield had a string of hits with the Impressions in the 1960s, including People Get Ready, Gypsy Woman, Talking About My Baby and Keep On Pushing.

Later, as a solo artist, Mayfield won a Grammy Award for the soundtrack Superfly.

Earlier this year he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, but was too ill to attend the ceremony.

No details are available on the cause of his death. He had been paralyzed since 1990, after equipment toppled on him during a concert.

He was 57.
