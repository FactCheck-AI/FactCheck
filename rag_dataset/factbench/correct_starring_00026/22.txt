THE WILD ONE

Starring Marlon Brando

(1953, Laslo Benedek) “What’re you rebelling against?” “Whaddya got?” In an image that launched a million posters, biker Marlon Brando and his gang zoom into Wrightsville (get it?) and shake things up good – but there’s Lee Marvin’s off-the-wall rival leader to contend with. DCP. Approx. 79 mins.
