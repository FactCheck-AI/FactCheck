On the Waterfront

108 mins | Rated PG | Crime

Directed by Elia Kazan | Starring Rod Steiger, Eva Marie Saint, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, Marlon Brando

(Elia Kazan, 1954, 108 min) Earning eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director (Elia Kazan), Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Supporting Actress (Eva Marie Saint), On the Waterfront features some of cinema’s great performances. Also nominated for Best Supporting Actor were Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden, and Rod Steiger. If that weren’t enough, the film features a completely original (not from other source material) Oscar Nominated score by Leonard Bernstein. Unlike the lead protagonist, Terry Malloy, an ex-boxer whose career is cut short by the mob, On the Waterfront was a contender and even better, a winner.
