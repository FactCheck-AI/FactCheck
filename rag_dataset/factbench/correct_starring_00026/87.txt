Synopsis

Best Picture winner about a longshoreman and washed-up boxer, who "coulda been a contendah," struggling under the constant "pier" pressure of the organized-crime syndicate that controls the docks on which he works. The film won eight Oscars, including Actor (Marlon Brando), Supporting Actress (Eva Marie Saint) and Director (Elia Kazan). In an Oscar oddity, Lee J. Cobb, Karl Malden and Rod Steiger were all nominated for Supporting Actor, which went to Edmond O'Brien ("The Barefoot Contessa").
