Liam Neeson will star in Mongoose, a cross-country car chase thriller that was acquired by Amazon Prime Video for a reported $20M at the Cannes Market. Neeson, who is currently in production on Naked Gun, will play Ryan “Fang” Flanagan in Moongoose, a war hero accused of a crime he didn't commit.

With nothing left to lose, Neeson's character leads the police on a cross-country car chase that attracts huge attention after being televised live. Flanagan, the former Taken star's character, wins the admiration of the public, and the military veteran is helped in his evasion of the police by his former Special Forces Army comrades.

In Mongoose, Neeson will work once again with Code Entertainment, who produced the Ice Road movies.
