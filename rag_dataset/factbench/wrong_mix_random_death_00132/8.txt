<strong>The</strong> <strong>Doctrinal</strong> <strong>Views</strong> <strong>of</strong> DR KURT ALAND, Textual Critic by A. Hembd, MACS Reformation International <strong>The</strong>ological Seminary A consultant to the <strong>Society</strong> <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Kurt</strong> <strong>Aland</strong> is perhaps the most renowned Biblical textual critic <strong>of</strong> the 20th century. Born in Berlin in 1915, he died in Münster/Westphalia in 1994. <strong>The</strong> most famous modern English versions <strong>of</strong> the New Testament—the Revised Standard Version, the New American Standard Version, the New International Version, and the English Standard Version—are all grounded on, and, for the most part, translated from, <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Aland</strong>’s work. <strong>The</strong>se translations utilise as their principal text (with its critical apparatus and alternate readings) the United <strong>Bible</strong> Societies version <strong>of</strong> the Greek New Testament, a version over which <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Aland</strong> was a principal editor. Indeed, the UBS version third edition (1983) is virtually the same as <strong>Aland</strong>’s own twenty-sixth edition <strong>of</strong> the Nestle-<strong>Aland</strong> text: such was his influence over the UBS text. 1 <strong>The</strong> Nestle-<strong>Aland</strong> Greek 26th edition and the UBS 1966 and 1983 Greek texts differ widely from the common Received Text which was used by all the great translations <strong>of</strong> the Reformation, including the Authorised Version in the English language (also known in some parts <strong>of</strong> the world as the ‘King James Version’). Thus, the versions translated from this new ‘critical’ text differ significantly from our Authorised Version as well. At present, the NIV and the ESV are sweeping evangelical churches in the United States and Britain. Thus, modern churchgoers are being pr<strong>of</strong>oundly influenced by <strong>Aland</strong>’s Greek Text, and so also by his peculiar views <strong>of</strong> the text. This is because the very verses that modern churchgoers are reading in their <strong>Bible</strong>s reflect the theological and textual views <strong>of</strong> <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Aland</strong>, which underlie his choices for readings and variant readings for every verse in the original Greek, from which these new versions are translated. However, very few churchgoers even know the name <strong>of</strong> <strong>Dr</strong> <strong>Kurt</strong> <strong>Aland</strong>. Many ministers do—the Nestle-<strong>Aland</strong> text is the one that they buy when in theological seminary (as is required for students
