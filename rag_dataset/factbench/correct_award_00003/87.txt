Iranian democracy activist Shirin Ebadi, the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize, said Wednesday her award would inspire other women in the Islamic world to seek their rights and denounced leaders in the region who use religion as a pretext for dictatorship.

Ebadi, Iran’s first female judge, appeared at the award ceremony without the headscarf that Iran requires women to wear in public, in what many viewed as a silent expression of her battle for freedom.

The Oslo ceremony came as the 10 other Nobel winners in 2003, including six Americans, were in Stockholm, Sweden, receiving the awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics. Afterward, the laureates were to attend the traditional Nobel banquet with the Swedish royal family and a host of dignitaries including former Vice President Al Gore.

An audience of hundreds, including members of the Norwegian royal family, rose to give Ebadi a standing ovation after she was given the coveted Nobel gold medal and diploma.

Selection as 'inspiration'

The award “inspires me and millions of Iranians and nationals of Islamic states with the hope that our efforts, endeavors and struggles toward the realization of human rights and the establishment of democracy ... enjoy the support, backing and solidarity of international civil society,” Ebadi said in a speech after receiving the $1.4 million award.

“Undoubtedly, my selection will be an inspiration to the masses of women striving to realize their rights, not only in Iran but throughout the region,” she said, speaking in Farsi.
