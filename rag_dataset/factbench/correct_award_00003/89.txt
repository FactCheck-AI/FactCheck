Shirin Ebadi was the first recipient of the

Presidential Medal for Global and Visionary Leadership

Shirin Ebadi stood up to conservative clerics while pioneering efforts to improve women's and children's rights in Iran. Her refusal to be silenced and willingness to address sensitive political issues have earned her international acclaim and, in 2003, the Nobel Peace Prize. She is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize.
