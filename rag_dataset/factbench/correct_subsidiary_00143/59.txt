Sleepycat was acquired by Oracle in 2006. The product continues to be available under the original open source license and continues to be enhanced. You can find the source code on Oracle's web site here in both .zip and .tar formats. The distribution includes the full source code.

Just FYI: Oracle has many open source products. Source code is freely available for all of them.

Disclaimer: I'm the Product Manager for Berkeley DB and have been working with the product for over 7 years, so I'm a little biased. :-)
