The Atlanta Hawks and Boston Celtics are the first known teams to secure face-to-face recruiting meetings with free-agent big man Dwight Howard, according to league sources.

Sources told ESPN that Howard, 30, is likely to meet with as many as five teams in free agency, with a return to the Houston Rockets widely seen as unlikely after Howard declined his $23.2 million player option for next season.

Teams can officially begin negotiating with free agents at 12:01 a.m. ET Friday. Howard will hold meetings in Atlanta on Friday, then in Las Vegas on Saturday, according to a league source.

The Miami Heat, sources said, have not yet booked a meeting with Howard in free agency, but could emerge as a more serious Howard suitor after registering preliminary interest in him.

ESPN reported earlier Tuesday that the Hawks, while still trying to convince Kevin Durant to grant a face-to-face sitdown, have been weighing a run at Howard to pair him with Al Horford in their frontcourt. Howard, a three-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year, is a native of Atlanta.

Horford is also a free agent this summer and will receive considerable outside interest.

Before Howard opted for free agency by declining his 2016-17 option, ESPN's Calvin Watkins reported that some members of the Rockets' organization were lobbying Howard to stay.
