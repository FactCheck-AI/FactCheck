Atlanta Hawks big man Dwight Howard has been out since Dec. 19 because of back tightness. He will be out of the lineup again on Friday against the Denver Nuggets, per Chris Vivlamore of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Despite an impressive career, physical ailments are nothing new for Howard. He suffered a quad injury earlier in the season, and he has dealt with back injuries throughout his NBA tenure. He even underwent season-ending back surgery in 2012.

When healthy, Howard is a primary piece in Atlanta's frontcourt rotation. In his first season with the team, he is averaging 14.2 points, 13.0 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game as a double-double threat and the primary anchor for the Hawks' interior defense on a nightly basis.

While he still struggles at the free-throw line (52.4 percent), Howard has made 63.2 percent of his field-goal attempts this season, which would be the highest mark of his career if he maintained it.

The 31-year-old is no longer in his prime, but he is an eight-time All-Star, three-time Defensive Player of the Year and five-time member of the NBA All-Defensive team, not to mention that he is one reason the Hawks are battling for early positioning in the postseason race.

Atlanta still has Paul Millsap to carry much of the scoring and rebounding load in the frontcourt while Howard is out, and Mike Muscala is averaging a career-high 21.6 minutes this season as someone who figures to see more action.

Elsewhere, Tiago Splitter is a playoff-tested veteran, but the Hawks announced he is out for Monday's game as well.

While back tightness doesn't seem like too pressing of a matter on the surface, Howard's injury history means Atlanta will likely use plenty of caution before he returns to the floor, especially this early in the season.
