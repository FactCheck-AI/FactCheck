After a long troubling season with the Houston Rockets and reported locker room tension with teammate James Harden, Dwight Howard is moving on to the Atlanta Hawks. The big man has reportedly signed a 3-year, $70.5M deal with the Hawks according to The Vertical's Shams Charania.

Dwight, who is an Atlanta native, will be returning home with a fresh start in mind. The once dominant All-Star has had some lackluster seasons after leaving the Orlando Magic and will now have to prove himself once again to a new team.
