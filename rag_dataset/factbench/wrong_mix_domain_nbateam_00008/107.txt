Atlanta Hawks center Dwight Howards got into an altercation with a Los Angeles Lakers fan after Sunday night's game.

The incident was caught on camera and posted online by TMZ Sports.

In the video, Howard is seen walking under a Staples Center tunnel following the 109–94 loss to Lakers. A fan called Howard a "b----" causing Howard to turn around and confront the fan.

Howard, who had 19 points and nine rebounds in the game, had to be restrained from going after the fan, after saying "come back [to the tunnel] and say it."

Howard spent one season with the Los Angeles Lakers after being traded there from the Orlando Magic before the 2012 season.

After the Lakers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Spurs, Howard decided to leave the team via free agency and sign with the Houston Rockets.
