The reality TV marriage curse has struck again. Christopher Knight and Adrianne Curry have split, RadarOnline.com has confirmed.

The pair announced their separation on their fifth wedding anniversary.

"Actor Christopher Knight and his wife, model and television star Adrianne Curry have announced today on their fifth wedding anniversary that they are separating," the couple's rep Phil Viardo told Hollyscoop breaking the story.

Viardo added that the marriage had been a tough road from the start, and in fact, Adrianne had revealed in 2007 that they were already in counseling.

"People who knew them were aware they were having problems, but were shocked by the split announcement," a source tells RadarOnline.com exclusively. "They had dinner together just last week!"

Knight, still best known as one of the stars of The Brady Bunch, met Curry, the first winner of America's Next Top Model, when they both appeared in the VH1 show, The Surreal Life. After their wedding, they went on to star in their own reality series, My Fair Brady.
