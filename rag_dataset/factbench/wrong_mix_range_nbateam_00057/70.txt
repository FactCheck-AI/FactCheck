Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams has hired Steve Blake and Randy Ayers as his assistants.

Per basketball reporter Peter Vecsey, Williams has hired Blake, who spent 13 years in the NBA as a player. The 38-year-old played with eight different teams before hanging up his jersey for good in 2016.

Meanwhile, the 63-year-old Ayers has had several assistant coaching stints with the Philadelphia 76ers, Orlando Magic, Washington Wizards, and the New Orleans Pelicans. He is a seasoned voice Monty Williams is counting on.

After his playing career, Blake was hired as a coaching intern in 2017. In an old interview, Blake shared that he felt that he could always handle the job of a coach. Per Jason Quick of NBC Sports:

“As a player, I felt like I knew the game well and could do it, but I would only want to have this role that I have,’’ Blake said after the Blazers’ first practice. “As much as I would love to be a full-time coach, I’m just not ready for that commitment, with my kids being so young and having just finished playing.’’

These are interesting developments for the Suns organization. Landing Monty Williams was a great milestone in itself. He is well regarded as a coach by peers and analysts alike. It would be interesting to see what moves will the Suns make this offseason.
