The Johnny Mercer Statue

On the west side of Ellis Square is a small sculpture of the famed Savannahian himself, Johnny Mercer. This bronze statue was actually sculpted by one of our own artist, Susie Chisholm.

Mercer was born in Savannah in 1909 and his body was returned here after his death in 1976. He was buried in Bonaventure Cemetery, where his grave has proved to be a tourist attraction.

Moon River and Baby It's Cold Outside are two well known songs of his.

Johnny Mercer is to Savannah what James Brown is to Augusta and what Little Richard and the Allman Brothers are to Macon.

He is one of the biggest names to come out of the city. Everybody knows a Mercer song. Revered is one way to describe him here.
