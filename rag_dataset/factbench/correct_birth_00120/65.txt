SAVANNAH, GA (WTOC) - Johnny Mercer may be gone, but his legend lives on in many ways. Come November 2009, you can visit Johnny Mercer in Ellis Square.

Wednesday, Savannah City Council approved the placement of a monument of Johnny Mercer to be located on the western edge of Ellis Square.

The life-size bronze statue of Johnny Mercer leaning against a fire hydrant and reading a newspaper is under construction. The design is based on a famous photograph of the world-renowned songwriter, who was born in Savannah and made significant contributions to the music industry.
