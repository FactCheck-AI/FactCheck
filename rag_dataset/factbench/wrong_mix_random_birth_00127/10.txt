Sam Stosur’s serve has contributed to significant fundraising efforts for the USANA True Health Foundation.

Stosur, along with the seven other USANA brand ambassadors competing on the WTA tour, raised $10 for every ace she served at WTA Premier-level events in 2015, which the WTA then donated to the Foundation as part of the Aces for Humanity initiative.

USANA True Health Foundation aims to provide the most critical human necessities to those suffering or in need.

“The WTA is proud to contribute $25,000 toward the USANA True Health Foundation,” said WTA CEO Steve Simon.

“Our entrusted partnership with USANA spans nearly 10 years and we are pleased to have the opportunity to provide support to this deserving Foundation which helps those in need.”

Stosur was one of the most prolific servers this season, finishing with 282 aces – the fourth most on tour behind Serena Williams, Karolina Pliskova and Madison Keys.
