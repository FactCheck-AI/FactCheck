A group called Discovery Partners has sued MetaSolv Software to stop Oracle's planned $219 million acquisition of the smaller business software maker, MetaSolv said on Tuesday.

MetaSolv, which makes products for the communications and media industries, said in a regulatory filing that Discovery Partners filed a class action petition charging that the company's directors breached their fiduciary duties to shareholders by agreeing to the merger.

The lawsuit, filed in the district court of Collin County, Texas, on October 23, also alleged that the proxy statement distributed to MetaSolv stockholders in connection with the deal contained insufficient or misleading information.

The lawsuit seeks to block the acquisition as well as monetary damages, MetaSolv said. Discovery Partners could not be reached and an Oracle spokeswoman declined to comment.

Oracle announced the MetaSolv takeover in October and said the deal would likely close in late 2006 or early 2007. The acquisition comes as Oracle has spent some $20 billion over the past three years buying up software rivals to better challenge market leader SAP of Germany.
