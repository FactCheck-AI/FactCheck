The struggling Celtics hosted the Charlotte Bobcats on November 25, 2005. Prior to the game, sophomore center Al Jefferson gave a young fan a pair of his shoes. The game itself was a narrow 90-89 Celtics victory at home, which snapped a two-game losing streak. Jefferson came off the bench to add seven points and four rebounds.
