SAP - Founder and History

On April 1, 1972, five former IBM employees –Dietmar Hopp, Hasso Plattner, Claus Wellenreuther, Klaus Tschira, and Hans-Werner Hector –started the company SystemAnalyse Programmentwicklung(System Analysis and Program Development), with a vision of creating a standard application software for real-time business processing. SAP stands for Systems Applications and Products in Data Processing.

Their idea was to create standard enterprise software that integrated all business processes and enabled data processing in real time. SAP's founders and employees worked closely with customers –often sitting side-by-side with employees in customers’ offices to learn their business needs and processes. By 1975, they had built applications for financial accounting (RF), invoice verification, and inventory management (RM). Some of their early customers were the nylon factory belonging to ICI in Östringen, Germany, Knoll, Burda, Linde, and Schott.

The blend of real-time data processing, standardization, and integration were the basis for SAP’s transformation from a small German company into a global leader in business software.
