Queen of All Media Kris Aquino and basketball player James Yap were wed on July 10, 2005 — 13 years ago today! — and in honor of the occasion, Kris turned her attention to the best part of their union.

"13 years ago today we made a commitment BUT fate took us in different directions. Yet together we produced 1 of my 2 greatest achievements aka BIMB... i sincerely wish you & your growing family peace & lasting happiness," the famed host wrote on Instagram.

Meanwhile, the text on the image she posted promoted optimism, too.

"She is at a place in her life where peace is her priority and negativity cannot exist," the post read.

Kris recently engaged James in a public social media spat after James lamented not being able to be there more for their son Bimby, especially on his birthday.

Kris accused James of hypocrisy, noting that James had the chance to be close to his son yet he failed to take it.
