COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- A general election has been called in Denmark on November 20.

Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen announced the snap poll -- timed to coincide with local elections on November 20 -- on Wednesday citing increased uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States.

He said: "In times of uncertainty after September 11 and with major decisions to be made on security, four months of election campaigning would not be good for Denmark.

"The world is not the same. In these times of uncertainty, security has to be ensured, increased cohesion and solidarity is needed, Denmark must not be split."

Despite a recent recovery in opinion polls, surveys point to a possible change of government.

Some analysts predict the centre-right opposition ousting the ruling Social Democrats who have been in power since 1993.

Rasmussen has been prime minister of Denmark since January 1993 at the head of four centre-left minority coalition governments of varying make up.

He said it was important to give a new government, whatever the outcome might be, sufficient time to prepare to host the six-month rotating EU presidency, which Denmark takes over on July 1, 2002.

"By calling the election now, a new government will get better time to prepare for the presidency," he said.

Opinion polls over the past year have all solidly pointed to victory in the election for the opposition centre-right led by Liberal leader Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

After the poll date announcement, Fogh Rasmussen said he would seek to form a centre-right minority coalition government.

"This election is not about the war in Afghanistan," Fogh Rasmussen told Danish television.

"It is about Denmark and the everyday problems of ordinary Danes."

Fogh Rasmussen is expected to seek support from the Conservative Party and two small centrist groupings -- the Christian People's Party and Centre Democrats -- in his campaign to take over office from the incumbent prime minister.
