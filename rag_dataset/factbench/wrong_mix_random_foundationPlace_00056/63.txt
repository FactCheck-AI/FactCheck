Merry Christmas ya filthy animal!

"Home Alone" is a cherished favorite at any time of the year but watching it in December as the holiday season rolls in is a merry treat.

First released in 1990, the Christmas comedy was directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John Hughes. The first film in the "Home Alone" franchise features Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard and Catherine O'Hara in lead roles.

The film is centered around Kevin McCallister, a naughty 8-year-old, who is accidentally left behind at home in Chicago, as his family flies to Paris for the Christmas holidays. While Kevin loves having the house to himself, he soon finds himself defending his house from a pair of determined burglars.
