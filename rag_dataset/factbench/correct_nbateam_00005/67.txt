On Friday afternoon, the Minnesota Timberwolves officially completed the proposed three-team deal with the New Orleans Hornets and Phoenix Suns that had been reported on July 25.

The deal will see the Twolves sending Wesley Johnson and a first-round pick to the Suns, so that the Hornets can send guard Jerome Dyson and the contract of retiring center Brad Miller to Minnesota.

This will then free up Minnesota's salary cap situation so that the team can complete the signing of free agent forward Andrei Kirilenko to a reported two-year, $20 million contract.
