Jason Terry agreed to terms on a three-year contract with the Boston Celtics, according to a report from Yahoo! Sports.

The veteran shooting guard averaged 15.1 points and 3.6 assists and 1.2 steals in 31:41 minutes per game with the Celtics last season. He shot 43 per cent from the field and 37.8 per cent from the three point line.

The Celtics are expected to use their entire $5 million mid-level exception to sign Terry, according to various reports.

It is unclear if the Celtics still plan to pursue Ray Allen after reaching terms with the 34-year-old Terry. Boston has already reportedly reached a three-year deal with veteran power forward Kevin Garnett.

The 2009 Sixth Man of the Year award winner won a championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2010-11.

The Atlanta Hawks originally selected Terry with the 10th overall section in the 1999 NBA Draft.

The deal cannot become official until July 11.
