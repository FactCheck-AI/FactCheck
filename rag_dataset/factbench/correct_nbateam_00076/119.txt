The Boston Celtics signed veteran guard Jason Terry Wednesday.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it was reported to be a three-year deal worth $15.6 million.

Terry has spent the last eight seasons with the Dallas Mavericks, averaging 15.1 points, 3.6 assists and 2.4 rebounds while shooting 37.8 percent from three-point range through 63 games (one start) last year.

"Jason is one of the best sixth men in the NBA and his versatility in the backcourt is a great addition to our roster," Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge said.

The 2009 Sixth Man of the Year has career averages of 16.1 points, 4.7 assists and 2.7 rebounds through 1,022 games, including 626 starts, with Atlanta and Dallas.

Terry has connected on 44.8 percent of his shots from the floor over his 13- year career while also shooting 38 percent from beyond the arc.
