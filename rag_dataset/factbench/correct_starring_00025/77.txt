Did anybody watch last night? Or was I the lone HSM Nerd. Any comments? What did you think of it?

I noticed that they had a better grasp on continuity this time around. HSM1 was filled with errors. Also in my personal opinion I thought this was much better choreographed. Here is the IMDB link http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0810900/

Well, they are all people associated with Disney. Zac Efron was in Hairspray though. So you might have heard of him from that.

I wasn't thinking many people here would be familiar with Disney Original Movies, but I decided to put it up anyways. Cause' you never know. There might be another High School Musical fan somewhere on the boards. haha
