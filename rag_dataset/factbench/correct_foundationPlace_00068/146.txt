To Support Equitable Growth and Belonging for BIPOC

Communities in Brooklyn

The Social Justice Fund is driven by a $50 million commitment made by the Joe and Clara Tsai Foundation to work toward Racial Justice and Economic Mobility in Brooklyn over the coming ten years. We work on social justice initiatives and make community investments in Brooklyn's BIPOC--especially black--community. The Fund seeks to address systemic injustice and the root causes behind racial gaps in education, health and wealth.

“It’s our role as philanthropists to promote fairness and equity in the most trying times, and when good investments help people to overcome challenges and get back on solid ground, that’s philanthropy in its purest form. I applaud my friend Clara Wu Tsai for her vision and leadership, and know that Gregg Bishop’s deep commitment to the people of New York City will be instrumental in providing stability for those who need it most.”

Darren Walker, President of the Ford Foundation.
