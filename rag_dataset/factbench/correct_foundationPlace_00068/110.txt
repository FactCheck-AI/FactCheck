Since 1995, the Buddy Walk® has been the premier advocacy event for Down syndrome in the United States. It is also the world’s most widely recognized public awareness program for the Down syndrome community. The flagship New York City Buddy Walk® attracts participants from coast to coast each year.

Walk day kicks off on September 7 in Times Square and on Facebook Live with the annual Times Square Video Presentation from 9:30-10:30 am ET. Then, meet us in Central Park from 11-3 for our NYC Buddy Walk and celebration. Bus tickets are available between the two locations. Whether you join us in person or from home, it will be a wonderful day for the community.
