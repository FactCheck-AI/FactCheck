Many celebrities often post photos of their children on their social media pages and attend events like movie premieres with them, but other famous names only share the occasional snap of their offspring.

Hollywood stars such as Home Alone actor Macaulay Culkin, Indiana Jones star Harrison Ford, Gossip Girlâs Blake Lively and Bond girl Halle Berry are known for being private with their family photos.

And some celebs like Mila Kunis and her husband Ashton Kutcher prefer to keep their kids' identities entirely hidden.

"We don't share any photos of our kids publicly because we actually feel like being public is a personal choice," said Kutcher said on the Thrive Global Podcast, adding: "My wife and I have chosen a career where weâre in the public light, but my kids have not."
