AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok is to quit as party leader and not run for a third term in office.

Kok, prime minister since 1994, made his decision public at a news conference on Wednesday where he also endorsed Labour parliamentary party chief Ad Melkert as his chosen successor.

The former trade unionist -- who became Labour party leader in 1986 -- has headed a three-way coalition during seven years of unprecedented Dutch economic growth.

Kok has been a key supporter of the 'Third Way' - the political philosophy of mixing the free market with social policies.

He has also been tipped as a possible successor to Romano Prodi as European Commission president, although Kok has made no statements of his intentions after quitting front-line Dutch policies.

Kok's trade unionist credentials ensured support from traditional party voters, while his defence of business interests won supporters in the VVD -- the second biggest party in his ruling coalition.

Melkert, 45, is a career politician said to be intelligent but lacking Kok's charm with ordinary voters, the Reuters news agency reported, and he has regularly trailed the prime minister in popularity opinion polls.

He has previously urged that more government money should be spent on health and education and has attacked what he perceives as the finance ministry's excessive influence in policy making.
