International Crisis Group is deeply saddened to learn of the passing of the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands Wim Kok, who served as a Crisis Group Trustee from April 2003 to June 2018. Wim died on 20 October 2018, aged 80.

Wim served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002. He began his long and distinguished career as a trade unionist and was elected to the Dutch parliament’s lower house in 1986 as a member of the Labour Party.

Wim joined Crisis Group’s Board at a time of heightened international uncertainty, shortly after the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. His extensive experience at the highest levels of government helped steer the organisation through troubling times.

“Wim was one of the Netherlands’ greatest politicians and a true guardian of Crisis Group’s mission to prevent deadly conflict”, said Crisis Group’s President & CEO Robert Malley. “Throughout his many years on the Board of Trustees, his sage advice, unique political insights and guidance greatly enriched our work”.

Wim Kok is survived by his wife and three children, to whom Crisis Group extends its sincere condolences.
