Introduction

E

leven years ago today Jake Norwood and team were wrapping up development of their revolutionary RPG, The Riddle of Steel. The following March the game was released at GAMA -- and the first print run sold out. A second printing soon followed and it is this version of the game that most players remember so fondly. The fact that we’re still talking about a game that was released nearly eleven years ago, a game that hasn’t had any official material published for it in the last five years, a game that still has an active community behind it, is testament to the originality of Jake’s game. What attracted gamers to it all those years ago still holds true today -- player-driven story and detailed, realistic combat mechanics producing a true Narrativist-Simulationist hybrid that appeals to players and referees alike. About two and a half years ago the trosfans community broached the subject of a successor game in earnest. Over the years many had asked whether a new version of TRoS could be produced, one that addressed the incon

sistencies prevalent in the first edition. Issues over ownership and copyright ruled out that option and so the idea of a successor game was introduced. Ninety threads and nearly two thousand posts later every aspect of TRoS has been picked apart and alternatives suggested. Upon this maelstrom of ideas order needed to be imposed. The greater pool of concepts needed to be gleaned, the numbers winnowed, until a coherent whole was formed. Who better to do this than two of the communities’ most active contributors? Phil and Michael had a clear vision for an RPG that worked seamlessly within the classic genre of Sword and Sorcery fiction. Today, with Blade of the Iron Throne they have produced a successor to TRoS that has none of the anomalies, none of the inconsistencies, none of the gaps -- yet retains a clear link to TRoS through player-driven story and demanding, realistic combat scenes. If Conan were to pick up a role-playing game, he’d choose this one. Ian Plumb – December 2012

A battered, gut-weary handful of hunted men – ruthless, half-wild outlaws hounded by killers as remorseless as themselves. Shivering in their dirt and blood-caked bandages, they rode on in grim determination, thoughts numb to pain and fear – although both phantoms rode beside them – intent on nothing more than the deadly necessity of flight. Flight from the hired bounty killers who followed almost on the sound of their hoofbeats. They were well mounted; their gear was chosen from the plunder of uncounted raids. But now their horses stumbled with fatigue, their gear was worn and travel-stained, their weapons notched and dulled from hard fighting. They were the last. The last on this side of Hell of those who had ridden behind Kane, as feared and daring an outlaw pack as had ever roamed the Myceum Mountains. No more would they set upon travellers along the lonely mountain passes, pillage merchants’ camps, terrorize isolated settlements. Never again would they sweep down from the dark-pined slopes and lay waste to villages on the coastal plains, then dart back into the secret fastness of the mountains where the Combine’s cavalry dared not venture. Their comrades were dead, fed ravens in a forgotten valley countless twisted miles behind their bent shoulders. Their leader, whose infamous cunning and deadly sword at last had failed them, was dying in his saddle. They were all dead men. And night was upon them.

What is a Role-playing Game?

ole-playing is about being creative and having fun. It involves getting together with friends to write a story, perhaps joining around a campfire or a dining room table to spin some tall tales. Role-playing games (RPGs) are stories in which you create one of the main characters and the story around that character. The rest of the players create stories around their own characters. The “referee” (or more simply “ref”) brings those stories together. The referee can be thought of as the “director” of the story. In most RPGs, the referee will - with input from you, if you desire to give any - describe a world or setting. You and your friends will play the protagonist and characters in this world, guiding your characters through the story that you and your friends create. Each player plays a different character, and each character interacts with each of the other characters. Role-playing, in this sense, is very much play-acting in the mind. You imagine what the referee describes. Then you imagine your character’s response to that situation, and describe that to the ref and the other players. They, in turn, each do the same with their characters. In most games – board games, card games, and dice games – there is a clearly defined way to win and a clearly defined way to lose. Typically, winning is the goal of the game. In role-playing games, the concepts of “winning” and “losing” do not exist. Your goal as a player

is to help create a story and to have fun. You may give your character other goals, but the success of your character does not determine any sense of “winning” or “losing.” Like life, it’s not so much whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. That’s all well and good, you say, but what actually goes on? What do these “characters” do? Most of the time, characters are involved in adventures; adventures of the type that are immortalized in adventure movies and serial novels. In one game, the characters might be a group of secret agents trying to save the world from nuclear destruction. In another, you might play a rebel force trying to overthrow an evil star-spanning empire. You might play a group of warriors in eleventh century Europe, or King Arthur’s knights, or Superman, or Batman, or an original character of your own creation - in any world you choose. Like all games and many RPGs, Blade of the Iron Throne involves elements of chance, skill, and strategy. These three elements are tightly related.

What kind of RPG is Blade of the Iron Throne? Blade of the Iron Throne (hereafter Blade) is an amalgamation of a number of different game system mechanics, a blend of new and old school gaming sensibilities. It is also very much a game grounded in tales of Sword & Sorcery (S&S) fiction. S&S is a sub-genre of fantasy fiction, taking its name from the sword-slinging adventurers, who generally make up the genre’s protagonists, and the sorcery-using characters, who are often the villains and/ or antagonists. Common to S&S stories is the mindset of the main character. The S&S hero is always a man of action. He may be very intelligent and given to brooding and pondering (e.g. Kull of Valusia), but when a situation requires a response, he does not hesitate or procrastinate endlessly. He acts. In S&S stories the world is an intrinsically harsh and tragic place; people’s lives are ruined or even terminated left and right. Just to survive, much less prosper, in this harsh world, the protagonist has to display a fair degree of harshness himself. However, a defining characteristic of S&S is that even

16 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

a quite wicked S&S hero has an unofficial and informal code; one that does not allow him to cross the line and treat unfairly friends and companions, people he has shared danger with, and even respected enemies. Indeed some he treats with consideration and kindness. The most vicious S&S hero adheres to this code; it separates him from the villains. An S&S villain will cross the line - that’s what makes him a villain. (See Chapter Seven – S&S Gaming, for more information on running a S&S campaign using Blade.)

Basic Rules - Checks I. Dice Types Used Most of the time in old-style gaming, you don’t use a rule; you make a ruling. The players can describe any action without needing to look at a character sheet to see if they “can” do it. The referee, in turn, uses common sense to decide what happens or rolls a die only if he thinks there’s some random element involved. When needed, Blade uses two types of dice during play, 12-sided dice (D12) and six-sided dice (D6). These may be easily purchased online or at your local game store. References throughout this book refer to 12-sided dice unless otherwise noted.

II. The Major Checks In Blade, Checks are made by rolling an appropriate number of dice for the Attribute or Skill level being tested against a fixed Target Number (TN) of seven (7). The number of successes needed for both Attribute and Skill Checks are drawn from Table 1.0.

** If the applicable dice pool is more than three times the required number of successes, no roll is needed, instead the character is considered to have achieved the amount of successes required.

Only dice rolled that meet or exceed TN7 are successes. With the exception of Proficiency and Mystery Checks, all Checks are made vs. TN7 unless modified by Assets.

Quality of Success may also denote an action’s degree of success as indicated in Table 1.1:

resent tasks attempted with one’s natural, in-

born ability, one’s talent, with abilities one has picked up along the way without formal training. 2. Skill Checks are tests made with a dice pool derived from a Skill level. Skills reflect a character’s aptitude in a trained, acquired pursuit. The degree of capability a character can attain through training is limited by his talent for it. Thus when using a Skill, a character’s Skill dice pool may never be as high or higher than twice the value of the Attribute that would be most applicable for the task attempted. For example, Cunning 3 means that you can use no more than 5 dice from the Lock Picking Skill in any situation, if Cunning would be the most appropriate Attribute Checked for the situation. Conversely, characters unskilled in a particular discipline work at a strong disadvantage compared to their skilled counterparts. They may attempt the Check by using the most closely corresponding Attribute instead of the Skill, but require twice as many successes as somebody knowing the Skill would. Example: Otho wants to accomplish a task requiring the Animal Ken Skill, but is untrained in it. He has a HT of 6 and therefore may use it for the Check instead. If someone skilled in Animal Ken would normally need 2 successes to succeed at a specific Animal Ken Check, Otho would instead need 4. Attribute and Skill values range from 1-8, with one Skill and one Attribute at level 9 al-

lowed per PC or NPC. While no two PCs may have a score of 9 in the same Attribute or Skill, NPCs are not bound by this stricture and thus may have the same Skill or Attribute at level 9 that his PC counterpart enjoys. However, for each Attribute or Skill there may only be a single NPC per campaign who has this Attribute or Skill at level 9. If this NPC dies or otherwise leaves the campaign, he may not be replaced by another NPC with a score of 9 in that Attribute or Skill for the rest of the campaign. Skill Check Challenge Levels should always frame the task in terms of how hard it is for someone who does it all the time. They are invariably vs. TN 7, unless modified by an Asset. Example: Having gained admission to the radja’s dinner ball, Otho prowls the halls in search for his intended pickpocket victim. The ref advises that the society vultures are unusually acerbic tonight and that Otho will have to bluff his way through several social encounters before locating the victim. He declares drawing no attention whatsoever to him a Challenging (two successes needed) feat of Etiquette. Skill levels are generally rated as per Table 1.2.

make the task harder to achieve for one than

the other party, he is advised not to call for an Opposed Check, but for a straightforward but difficult Attribute or Skill Check instead. If an Opposed Check matches one character against several characters at the same time, a single roll is made for every character, with the solitary character comparing his result with every opponent’s result. For example, if a thief tries to sneak past two soldiers standing guard, one roll is made for the thief and one for every soldier, and the thief’s result compared separately to both results, for two Qualities of Success. Example: Otho makes his move at the ball and invites a rich old dowager (and her beautiful diamond necklace!) to dance. As they swirl about the dance floor he directs her to a

somewhat unobserved spot and deftly attempts to remove the necklace. An Opposed Check with two antagonists to Otho is now called for: The guard closest to the pair makes a Check of his Sagacity 4 Attribute, testing his powers of observation. The dowager makes a Check of her Sagacity 3 Attribute, to determine if she is aware of the necklace being removed. Otho will make a single Check of his Skill of Pick Pockets 6 against both. Otho needs to tie the guard’s result to pocket the necklace unobserved by the guard (the status quo being that the guard notices nothing special), but he needs to trump the dowager’s successes to filch the necklace (the status quo being that she has it). Otho achieves an unlucky 1 successes, the guard an average 2 successes, and the dowager a somewhat lucky 2 successes. While the guard would have noticed nothing out of the ordinary, the dowager feels Otho’s groping fingers and raises a ruckus, leaving Otho to bluff his way out of a tight spot. 5. Timed Checks can be made of any of the previously mentioned Checks. These rolls are made when the time in which a lengthy task is accomplished is of importance, such as when pursuing research,

21 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

crafting an item, or searching the wilderness for the outlaws’ encampment. Each Timed Check requires a number of successes that must be achieved over the course of any amount of rolls. Each roll usually represents the passage of a fixed amount of time. With Opposed Timed Checks, the numbers of successes from each component Check are not usually subtracted from each other, but every party totals their successes. As soon as one party achieves the required number of successes, it achieves its goal. This number of successes may or may not be equal. The former would for example be the case in a race, the latter in a pursuit. Example 1: Otho, having been cheated out of some swag from a robbery, is pursuing three fellow thieves through the White Knuckle Mountains. As both parties are traversing the trackless wilderness on foot, the ref determines that this is an Opposed Check matching Otho’s Survival Skill against the fugitives’ single worst Survival Skill (staying together, they are travelling at the speed of the slowest among them). He advises that Otho will need a Quality of Success of 12 against the fugitive’s QoS of 8 to catch up with them

22 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

before they reach, cross, and destroy the sole rope bridge across Raven’s Gorge. Example 2: As the stars are rapidly moving into the constellation presaging the return of the demon lord Yslsl, Braddeyas the sorcerer is attempting to make sense of a coded passage in the Tome of Du’Karrn that is thought to instruct about Yslsl’s weakness. The referee informs him that he has to achieve a Quality of Success of 20 on his Decipher Skill Check, with every Check taking an entire day, and the stars moving in constellation in seven days. Complications: In Blade, any Unopposed Check that fails to meet its required number of successes by more than 1 or any Opposed Check made with 5 or more dice and failing to achieve even a single QoS success is what amounts to a botch or bad fumble. However, instead of penalties, catastrophes or comedic moments of embarrassment inappropriate to individuals as formidable as the PCs, such results create “Complications”. While Drama use (see the section on Drama under Passion Attributes in the Training chapter) may add specific elements to a story that are of interest to the player, Complications are a way for the referee to add their own plot twists to the tale. They signify something untoward happening to the PC, some newly arising difficulty, or a stroke of luck for his opponents. Complications should be introduced quickly by the referee, certainly no later than by the following scene, and should have an at least

tenuous connection with the task that was badly failed. Example: Otho, abducting the radja’s daughter for ransom, battles past a number of guards, and after failing badly twice during the raid,

finally manages to slip away with his prize slung over his shoulder. BANG! The ref decides to have both his Complications kick in immediately:

1. Basic Attributes, or just Attributes, are the character’s inherent physical, spiritual, and social capabilities and govern, among other things, how he is perceived by others, how strong, fast, healthy, knowledgeable, and smart he is, and how well developed his instincts and social intelligence are. The six Basic Attributes are: Brawn – (BN) is a measure of your muscle, your vitality, or your frame. It indicates how much damage you do unaided, and how easily you resist punishment, disease, and poison. Daring – (DG) is a measure of your courage and ability to take decisive action. It affects how well

Sagacity – (SY) is a measure of your mental agility. It indicates how logical, intuitive, and smart you are. It affects situations that require reasoning, sharpness of the senses, as well as any judgment relating to them. Cunning – (CG) is a measure of your raw instincts, agility, reaction time and balance. It affects how skilled you are with actions like lock picking, pick pocketing, hiding, and sneaking.

2. Passion Attributes - All characters possess four Passion Attributes, or for short, Passions, each having a maximum value of five points. In addition, each character has a special fixed Passion Attribute known as “Drama”. Quite simply, Passion Attributes give your character the will, drive, and determination to accomplish and succeed when the going gets tough.

Now, how do they work? If your character is involved in a situation where he is struggling to defend, protect, further, or foster a PA, that PA gives its numerical value as extra dice added to the roll. For Attribute or Skill Checks,

Suddenly do you wish you were a bit stronger, or maybe a bit more nimble of mind? Then spend the points mid game, and it is so. See Chapter Two Characters, and Chapter Three - Training, for more on choosing and using Passion Attributes. 3. Combined Attributes are derived directly from the Basic Attributes. These are:

Reflex is the combination of Daring and Cunning, which determines how quickly a character may physically react to external stimulus. Aim, extracted from Sagacity and Cunning, quantifies one’s natural ability to hit a target over distances. Knockdown, derived from Brawn and Daring, is a measure of how solid and balanced one remains after taking a blow. Knockout is a measure of how hard it is to knock a character unconscious, based on Brawn and Tenacity. Move, derived from Brawn, Cunning, and Daring, is a measure of how much distance one can cover on foot in a hurry. Sorcerous characters have a sixth Combined Attribute governing the use of sorcery, Power.

The chamberlain faced the big man. He drew a scroll from his toga, unrolled it, scanned it briefly, then looked up. “Are you Fafhrd the northern barbarian and brawler?” The big man considered that for a bit, then said, “And if I am –?” The chamberlain turned towards the small man. He once more consulted his parchment. “And are you – your pardon, but it’s written here – that mongrel and long-suspected burglar, cutpurse, swindler, and assassin, the Gray Mouser?” The small man fluffed his gray cape and said, “If it’s any business of yours – well, he and I might be connected in some way.” As if those vaguest answers settled everything, the chamberlain rolled up his parchment with a snap and tucked it inside in his toga. “Then my master wishes to see you. There is a service you can render him, to your own considerable profit.” The Gray Mouser inquired, “If the all-powerful Glipkerio Kistomerces has need of us, why did he allow us to be assaulted and for all he might know slain by that company of hooligans who but now fled this place?” The chamberlain answered, “If you were the sort of men to allow yourselves to be murdered by such a mob, then you would not be the right men to handle the assignment, or fulfill the commission, which my master has in mind.” Fritz Leiber, “The Swords of Lankhmar”

Characters in Blade are painted in broad strokes by their Talents. These Talents, primarily Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies, are used by the player as a metric of their character’s strengths and weaknesses. Players can and should consult the wide body of Sword & Sorcery literature available for their inspiration. Joining in with their referee and fellow players they can then exchange ideas and work on creating character histories (and Passions) that will work in harmony with the rest of the group’s goals and story direction. This is where the Talent table now comes into play. Our particular Blade Talent Table is comprised of six Talents. While the described categories of Attributes, Skills, and Proficiencies form the heart of the entries on the Blade Talent Table, there are many more possibilities that should be pondered. Much of the choices concerning the remaining three Talents will be based on both the setting, and the needs and expectations of the gaming group involved. For example, one should be concerned with the question of if

there is to be sorcery in the setting. If so, to what degree? Will racial choices other than human be offered to players? These and many other questions once answered will give a referee his compass points when building his own Talent Table. Having by now gotten a sense of the character that they wish to build stories around, players then translate these ideas to Blade by selecting Talent levels based on their importance to the player’s vision of their character. Will the character be a man of fierce fighting ability? Or, perhaps a deft thief prowling the rooftops of fantastic cities! Whatever the player decides will be the prime focus of his character warrants a priority “A” or “B” pick. Next come aspects of the character that should still demonstrate competence or training. These will likely merit a “C” or “D” pick. And last comes those picks that the player has determined are not of major concern to his Blade experience, the “E” and “F” picks. For our included sample setting we’ve created a Talent table as an example. Using this table as a guideline, arrange the listed categories into priorities A-F (A being the highest priority, F the lowest, least important aspect of your character).

33 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

Each of these categories, and the results of placing them in various Priorities, is now explained in detail. 1. Sorcery The lands of the Sword & Sorcery campaign, though dominated by skillful swordsmen, are still yet haunted by powerful sorcerers wielding their dark magic. The Sorcery Priority governs the relation of your character to the occult mysteries of the supernatural, whether your character is steeped in them, just a regular guy, or victimized by those dark forces. If you plan on playing a non-sorcerer character then select either “Mundane” as your Priority D (the Average priority), or “Cursed” as your Priority E. Selecting “Doomed” as your Priority F also gives you a character without sorcerous powers, but shouldn’t be done lightly; the character is not likely to survive this choice. If you want to play any type of wielder of arcane powers, chose Sorcery as your Priority A, B, or C, but choose carefully as the sorcerous Mysteries to which those Picks give your character access are all he will ever be able to learn; no sorcerer can ever learn more Mysteries than those allowed by his initial Sorcery Pick.

34 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

Once you have made your choice, create a background that fits your concept, discussing your choice with your fellow players and the ref. This gives others the chance to riff off your inspiration and create character origins that will work well with your own. A) A Mysteriarch is one of the greatest masters of the arcane alive. He can know all Mysteries, both Lesser and Greater, and he starts out the game with knowledge of a single Arcane Secret. He receives one free point in the Occultism Skill and one free Proficiency point to spend on Mysteries, but may not put more Proficiency points into Greater than into Lesser Mysteries. B) Sorcerer denotes somebody deeply steeped and well versed in arcane knowledge. He can know either all six Lesser Mysteries, or three Lesser and one Greater Mystery. He receives one free point in the Occultism Skill. Should he opt for a Greater Mystery, it may be of no greater value than his highest Lesser Mystery. C) Dabbler encompasses hedge wizards, witch doctors, sages of secret lore, some of the more devoted cultists of unwholesome deities and other serious meddlers in the occult. Such characters may know up to two Lesser Mysteries and may also have the Occultism Skill. Enslavement and Witchfire may not both be chosen. D) Mundane denotes the common man. He has heard whispers of sorcery but has most likely never encountered it, has no affinity for it, and most certainly doesn’t know any.

E) Cursed denotes a person not only unskilled in the arcane, but also somehow particularly vulnerable to harmful sorcery. When he checks to resist sorcerous harm or influence, he does so at a +2 TN penalty. F) Doomed is a person not only devastatingly open to harmful sorcery, but actually victimized by it. He resists sorcery as per the E Pick, Cursed, and on top of this has already contracted some kind of terrible supernatural doom or weird. This doom hanging over him is geared toward a specific, utterly ruinous fate, expressing itself in mechanical terms as the equivalent of a Curse Rating 6 (See the Cursing Mystery), which can be lifted by neither faith or sorcery. This doom need not be geared toward PC death, but if it isn’t it needs to be geared to the utter destruction of all the PC holds dear and wants to achieve. Whatever the doom may be, it must run its course, undoing the PC in some nasty fashion. Alternatively, it might be remotely possible to lift by means of an impossible quest. Such a quest should take up more than five game sessions devoted solely to it,

37 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

These points you may assign as you will, with but two cautions: All players must nominate one of their attributes as their “Focus.” No other attribute may exceed the point value of the “Focus” during the process of character creation. In addition, no character should start with any Attribute at the unique level of 9. This level should be reserved for development during play with others. Our example of character creation provides some thoughts on the process of assignment of points to Basic Attributes. Next, work with your fellow players and ref to create your four Passion Attributes and fill them in on your character sheet. Beginning Passion Attribute Points are the same for each beginning character: 7 points to be distributed between the four open Attributes and the fixed Drama Attribute. Any given Passion Attribute may be as low as zero or as high as five. Combined Attributes are calculated by combining two or more existing attributes. These should be calculated once all Basic and Passion Attributes are finalized. All numbers equal to or greater than .50 are rounded up.

Reflex = (Cunning + Daring)/2 Aim = (Sagacity + Cunning)/2 Knockdown = (Brawn + Daring)/2 Knockout = (Brawn + Tenacity)/2 Move = (Brawn + Cunning + Daring)/3 4. Skills Next, assign all available Skill points to those Skills you desire for your character. Again, available points are determined by the Priority level selected, and no character should begin initial play with any Skill at level 9. Pay close attention for any Sorcery, Cultural, or Asset modifiers to your Skills that you may be entitled to, and once each Skill has been chosen; write those Skills down on your sheet. For a complete listing and description of Skills, see Chapter Three: Training. 5. Proficiencies Proficiencies refer to weapons training. Each selected Melee Proficiency or Missile Proficiency conveys training in a single style of combat or grouping of weapons. As always, available points are determined by the Priority level selected. Points may be distributed in any manner the player desires, though no Proficiency may start out with the maximum rating of 13. Once you have your Proficiencies assigned, write down any associated Maneuvers or Mysteries (Both are described in Chapters Three and Six respectively) on your character sheet.

Other Details Now is the time to fill in any blank spaces on your character sheet with such information as your character’s Movement rate, or beginning Loot Level and Equipment (see Chapters Three and Appendices respectively for both), for wealth and items that your character may have acquired.

The protagonists in sword-and-sorcery fiction are most often thieves, mercenaries, or barbarians struggling not for worlds or kingdoms, but for their own gain or mere survival. They are rebels against authority, skeptical of civilization and its rulers and adherents. A thoughtful back-story or biography for your Blade character is the surest way to transform him from a two-dimensional figure to a fascinating and exciting S&S hero. Hopefully, these character creation tips will help you in that process. 1) First, jot down some notes describing the

tough who nurses a grudge against the local crime lord who murdered his mother years ago. His core motivations in life are revenge for his mother, and the acquisition of wealth. He quickly decides all four of his Passions: Passion # 1 – Revenge on the gang boss who murdered my mother! Passion # 2 - Get the money! Passion # 3 - Keep my hide safe! Passion # 4 – Hatred for the rich! 2) While S&S protagonists are rarely lily-white, you should decide what kind of ethics or creed your character lives or dies by. Otho is not too trustworthy and will exploit people and situations if profit is available (although he doesn’t necessarily gain plea-

41 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

When he sees an opportunity for gain he will jump right into it without too much thought, although he is the opposite when danger arises. In battle he will tend to seek cover and fight only when confident that he will have the upper hand, though if desperate he is capable of fighting with tiger-like ferocity. 3) Determine the physical qualities of your character. This includes most of the things you will find on the character sheet (Name, Culture, Attributes, Assets, Race, etc.). Many of these items will be imperative to determining the history and tastes of your character. Paul decides on the following order of Otho’s Talents: First, Paul selects Sorcery for his “F” pick, and decides that Otho is unaware of the nature of the “Doom” that he lives under. Next, mulling over his choices on the Talent table, Paul selects his “E” choice as “Decadent” since he feels this will best represent the horrid conditions that Otho grew up in. This will limit his Tenacity to a maximum value of 7. Paul opts to take a Poor

42 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

Asset instead of limiting his maximum Brawn value to 7 as well. Flipping over to the Assets section of chapter three he selects the Poor aspect of Arrogance. This Poor Asset reflects an area of Otho’s personality that Paul would like to explore; Otho’s temper and the fragility of his ego. Having gotten his two toughest picks out of the way, Paul now selects “Proficiencies” for his “D” pick, though this will limit him to only 6 Proficiency points initially. Paul wants to focus his build on strong Attributes and a good selection of Skills. All 6 points go into the Cut & Thrust Proficiency. To balance his Poor Asset, Paul opts to make his “C” priority a Good Asset. From chapter three he selects the Good aspect of Cautious, again, a choice that well reflects Otho’s personality. On to “B”! Paul now selects Skills for his “B” pick. This will give him 33 points to drop on Skills! He spends those points in the following Skills: Climbing 6, Disguise 3, Etiquette 4, Falsehood 4, Lock Picking 3, Information Gathering 3, Pick Pockets 6, Sneaking 4. He now arranges his 34 points for the “A” Attribute pick as follows: Brawn 5, Daring 6, Tenacity 4 (5-1 for Decadent), Sagacity 4, Heart 6, and Cunning 8. 4) Now you get to the environmental influences upon your character. Where did he grow up? What social class is he? Who are/were some of the people closest to him (enemies, parents,

A harsh life has taught him to trust no one, nor to grow too attached to any person or place, though if his loyalty was ever earned it would be frightening in its intensity. 7) Lastly, it is up to both you and your referee to graft your character’s history to those plot elements that will in turn bind the new character to the Blade campaign. Was your character somehow wronged by a principal antagonist in one of the ongoing plot arcs? Was your character simply out to help himself or his people, or was he simply swept up into the adventure? Having finished the history and personality of your character, this should be a rather simple thing to do working alongside your referee. Both Paul and the referee determine that one plot arc of the upcoming game will revolve around the great shipment of coin that the local gang boss annually moves out of the city. Even getting information on the timetable of the coin’s movement will be extremely dangerous. Otho will most certainly need allies in order to successfully hit the crime lord’s money train.

The FOUR Shoulds 1. Your character should have a flaw that balances out their strength. E.g.: A fierce swordsman with an inability to trust anybody at all. 2. Your character should have its own vernacular and speech quirks based on where he has come from. 3. Your character should be played in a realistic manner. If role-playing a slightly built teenage girl, she must act like a teenager and not like a full grown woman. She will be innocent in some ways and worldly in others, depending on her upbringing. 4. Characters should interact with each other! While normally a no-no in gaming, consider having a resentment or rivalry with another player’s character. With your group’s agreement (Hey, they have to live with your characters too!), work with both your referee and teammate to ratchet up the tension between the two rivals. In S&S stories characters are more likely to simply need each other rather than being bound by ties of friendship. They can’t just all get along like they’re on a jolly holiday, and even if they’re friendly, there could still be rivalry and insults when the action heats up! So there you have it. Now it’s your turn!

IV. Creating your own Talent Table The Talent table as presented in this chapter is just one of many possible incarnations of

44 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

this table; one that will probably suit most games of Blade, but not necessarily all. To some settings, such as gritty historical ones, the Culture column might not apply; others might be either devoid of anything supernatural or keeps such elements strictly out of players’ hands, and thus have no Sorcery column; and while the Asset column will likely be common, not all referees will be interested in adding it. The only three columns that are universal to all games of Blade are Attributes, Proficiencies and Skills. Some, but by no means all, possible ideas for the other priorities are: Race: In campaigns where non-human races are more common than the default for Blade, the group might want to allow players access to such races as PCs. A Race priority would regulate access to the various racial packages. Social: In some campaigns the players might have the option to have their PCs belong to widely different social classes. A Social priority would give access to anything from slave to nobleman, with the attendant wealth and legal privileges or limitations. Connections: Especially in campaigns of the cloak-and-dagger type, the extent of a PC’s access to local flows of power and information may be relevant. A Connections priority would determine how well-connected a PC is. Status: In some campaigns all PCs might be members of the same organization, for instance a cult or an army. A Status priority in such campaigns could be used to determine

a PC’s status within the organization, from grunt to mover and shaker. The design of Blade endorses and actually encourages this type of column customization; take them, make them your own, and remold them to best support the game you want to play. There’s no need to have a column that isn’t truly important in your game. To help you design your own columns, here are the basics of how we have designed ours: The D Pick is considered to be average, providing no special benefit or disadvantage. Descending the line from D, E is noticeably worse, though not devastatingly so; the difference amounts to 2 Attribute or Proficiency points, 6 Skill points, or 1 Asset. The F Pick is intended to be truly poor and is set about three times as far below in value to the D Pick as the E Pick is; the equivalent of about 6 Attribute or Proficiency points, 18 Skill points or 3 Assets seeming about right to us. Our choice of numbering here is very deliberate; we wanted every step on the table away from D to be larger than the one preceding it. This uneven stepping also applies when one ascends the line of the table from the average D Pick. The C Pick equally scales improvement from the D Pick as much the E Pick worsens it; C

45 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

and E are intended to mirror the other’s separation from the D Pick. In contrast, the B Pick is not intended to mirror the F Pick in the same way. Instead there is a less drastic improvement from C compared to the F Pick’s drop from D; the equivalent of 3 Attribute or Proficiency points, 9 Skill points or 2 Assets better than C seems to us to be on target.

The A Pick is obviously intended to be the most advantageous, and thus is about twice as rewarding compared to the D Pick than the B Pick; the difference from A to D amounting to about 10 Attribute or Proficiency points, 30 Skill points, or 6 Assets. So now you have our architecture of the Talent table; now go forth and customize your own!

The oracle chamber held no clue for him. He went forth into the great throne room and laid his hands on the throne. It was heavy, but he could tilt it up. The floor beneath, a thick marble dais, was solid. Again he sought the alcove. His mind clung to a secret crypt near the oracle. Painstakingly he began to tap along the walls, and presently his taps rang hollow at a spot opposite the mouth of the narrow corridor. Looking more closely he saw that the crack between the marble panel at that point and the next was wider than usual. He inserted a dagger point and pried. Silently the panel swung open, revealing a niche in the wall, but nothing else. He swore feelingly. The aperture was empty, and it did not look as if it had ever served as a crypt for treasure. Leaning into the niche he saw a system of tiny holes in the wall, about on a level with a man’s mouth. He peered through, and grunted understandingly. That was the wall that formed the partition between the alcove and the oracle chamber. Those holes had not been visible in the chamber. Conan grinned. This explained the mystery of the oracle, but it was a bit cruder than he had expected. Gorulga would plant either himself or some trusted minion in that niche, to talk through the holes, the credulous acolytes, black men all, would accept it as the veritable voice of Yelaya. Remembering something, the Cimmerian drew forth the roll of parchment he had taken from the mummy and unrolled it carefully, as it seemed ready to fall to pieces with age. He scowled over the dim characters with which it was covered. In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian’s linguistic abilities, for he had experienced many adventures where knowledge of a strange language had meant the difference between life and death.

“Thus tempered in the fire of conflict and strife, each slayer discovers that he holds a flame locked within his very heart, a blaze of passion that must ever char his soul lest it instead betray him to his enemies. And while it may flicker and waver in time, only death can truly quench this fire, yet until such time, it shall seek to consume him – or be unleashed upon those who would oppose him.”

I. Skills Overview Skills are specialized bits of knowledge that a character can learn and eventually master. They are more specific applications of an Attribute. For example, the Skill Trapping is a more specific use of a character’s Cunning. Skills are areas of expertise that are not necessarily common to every living creature - some creatures simply don’t have the capacity to learn certain Skills. Initially purchased with Skill points and chosen according to the player’s particular interest, characters learn their Skills through instruction or experience.

II. Skill Descriptions As this Skill list includes broad definitions not applicable to all settings for which Blade could be used, the referee has the final say on actual Skill applications. Skills are described with the Attribute with which they are most commonly associated. Acting (HT) The character is skilled in all aspects of stage acting in front of crowds. Memorizing lines, voice projection, body control and voice mimicry are all within the range of the normal use of this Skill. A character may be required to make Checks when putting on an important show; in front of an important crowd; or if required to speak especially difficult lines. The character can accurately mimic the voice of any given individual that he has heard speak

at least once. Without the Disguise Skill, this can be useful when shouting or speaking to another person from behind a door or while otherwise out of sight. When combined with Disguise, Acting can be used to play the part of a specific person. In these cases, only the worse of the two Skills is checked during the interaction, not both. Ancient Languages (SY) This Skill provides the ability to read, write, and eventually speak one chosen language from a long ago, lost civilization. Ancient Languages can only be used to learn languages from the past that are not typically spoken in the character’s modern world. The character’s ability with this Skill is directly related to its level. At levels 1-3, the character can recognize common written glyphs and symbols in the language. As the character’s Skill level increases, he gains an understanding of progressively more obscure elements of the language. At levels 4-6, he can begin to surmise how the ancient language was spoken, based on both his knowledge of the language and later languages that developed from it. By levels 7-9 he can speak the language with fluency and flair. Literacy is a prerequisite for this Skill. At character cre-

51 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

ation, every Skill point invested into an Ancient Language Skill buys two points in that Ancient Language. Animal Ken (HT) A character with Animal Ken is particularly keen on determining the drive, desires, demeanor, and feelings of an animal. To use the Skill, the character must observe a creature for a few minutes and then roll a Skill Check. If successful, the character can sense something about the creature’s current motivation, desires, or the specifics of its emotional state. Additional information may be gained through further Skill Checks. This Skill is useful when attempting to train animals to behave in a particular way or to teach them tricks. However it can only be used to teach an animal something it is able to perform usually, within the constraints of its intelligence level and body shape. Tricks might include searching out or tracking specific prey; retrieving objects; guarding others or an area; reacting in specific ways to symbols or hand motions; returning home from any location; attacking or retreating on command; walking with a particular gait; and many more. This Skill can also be used to affect the creature’s over-

52 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

all behavior -perhaps to make it more passive or aggressive than it normally would be, for example. Apothecary (SY) Throughout history, different cultures have devised remedies for a wide range of ailments. The character with an Apothecary skill is able to create non-magical, medicinal drugs from plants, minerals, and animal parts. These medicines’ benefits are not often instant; efficacy may take between minutes and several hours. They may carry side effects, especially when they are very potent. This skill includes the study of poisons, their effects and detection, as well as the treatment of poisoned individuals. The character can diagnose a poisoned character and recommend an antidote or treatment if he can identify the symptoms and the source of the poison, or if he has a sample of the poison itself. A successful Skill Check allows the creation of medicines, poisons, or antidotes from ingredients at hand. Note that while this skill provides the knowledge of how to prepare ingredients to make medicines, poisons, and antidotes, it does not provide the character with the ability to find the ingredients in the wild, which is an application of the Survival Skill. Battlefield Tactics (SY) This Skill gives a character the savvy to move troops and resources into optimal battle-

field position. He knows when and where to fight to make the most of his available troops and resources, taking advantage of terrain and weather. This allows an experienced tactician to fight large-scale battles with fewer men than an opponent, with a reasonable chance of success. With knowledge of the battlefield and the standard tactics of his opponent, the character will spend a few minutes with his comrades, explaining the tactics to be employed in the upcoming battle. This discussion must take place within two hours of battle. He then makes an opposed Battlefield Tactics Check against the enemies commander. If successful, all comrades that received the instructions gain –1 TN to all Soldiering Skill Checks made during that combat. Climbing (DG) This Skill provides a character with the ability to climb many types of vertical surfaces. The number of successful Climbing Checks needed to complete a task may vary, and especially long climbs may require a string of Checks. In this case each single Skill Check should represent a real and tangible benefit, like a concrete leg of the trek being completed, not just some distance climbed. Customs (HT) This Skill provides an understanding of other cultures’ customs. A character does not risk of offending people from a known culture, and

is adept at quickly recognizing and reacting to the customs of newly encountered cultures. This differs from Etiquette in that Etiquette only provides knowledge of the social intricacies of the elite, whereas Customs is equally effective across all portions of a population. Customs cannot be used to duplicate the effects of Etiquette. So a character with Customs, but without Etiquette, could not appear as one of the aristocracy. Dancing (DG) The character knows the artistry of dancing, and is trained in the art of performing in front of an audience. The character is well versed in all the popular dances of the time, including those with complex or detailed steps. He is also adept at picking up new dances, and can create his own which may become popular. Decipher (SY) This Skill provides the ability to decipher unknown written words, codes or glyphs. When faced with an unknown text, a character uses this Skill to appraise the frequency and patterns of certain symbols, and to come up with theories of what he believes the communication to hold. This time consuming pro-

Disguise (CG) This Skill endows a character with the ability to transform himself or someone else. A basic Check allows the character to appear different from his current self with changes of hair, clothing, sex, or social class, along with measurable changes such as weight and height. When combined with Acting, Disguise can be used to play the part of a specific person. To do this, all Skill Checks must be successful. In this situation, only the worse of the two Skills need be checked during the interaction, not both. Etiquette (HT) The character understands the social intricacies of encounters with the elite. He knows what and what not to talk about; how to greet others; which utensils to use when eating and how these should be held; which dance steps are in vogue; and any number of other verbal and non-verbal upper-class courtesies. With the Customs skill, but without Etiquette, one might pass as a member of another culture, but not as one of their aristocracy.

Sagacity with twice the number of needed successes. Studying the various forms of dishonesty, one becomes necessarily both doubtful of people’s honesty and adept at behaving in a controlled way so as to give nothing away. When somebody proficient in Falsehood tells the truth and is suspected otherwise, as lying has become second nature to him, he must use his Falsehood Skill and score twice the usual number of successes required in order to overcome the doubts of the listener. Should the Check be tied or fails, he is automatically considered to be lying. Foreign Languages (SY)

Characters may use this Skill to tell lies (Heart), or to detect lies (Sagacity) and resist the detection of their own lies (Heart).

This Skill provides a character the ability to speak one chosen non-native language that is in current use in his world. The level of the Skill determines the extent of his knowledge. Thus a character with a level of 1 to 3 would be able to speak like a person who has arrived in a new country and be able to read everyday signs about town. Those with the Skill at the level of 7-9 have the vocabulary of a highly intelligent scholar or

Falsehood (HT/SY)

Healing (SY) In the event of injury, illness or disease, the Healing Skill endows a character with an understanding of medical procedures and medicines to help himself and others. (Note that the creation of medicines and poisons, or the neutralizing of poisons requires the Apothecary Skill.) One of the most important uses of the Healing Skill is First Aid. When an injury occurs, if a successful Healing Skill Check is performed within an hour, the patient regains 1 Pain point per success against the wound being tended. The Healing Skill can also be used to provide continuing care to an injured patient. When a character rolls his weekly TY Check to determine if he has shed Pain points, the character with the Healing Skill can tend to him, rolling his own Healing Skill Check just prior to the injured character’s TY Check. If the Healing Check is successful, the injured character gains 1 bonus success for his TY Check for each success scored in the caregiver’s Check. Information Gathering (HT) A character with this Skill is adept at tracking down the answers to questions and mysteries by finding the right person to talk to. Usually in a public location -perhaps a bar or a shop-the character is led step by step to the information he seeks through conversation, purchasing goods, or making small bribes. The character should be smart about how he

asks questions, especially when he is seeking information about a powerful person that has a lot of influence in the area. It may require several steps, each with a Check of its own, and each with its own role-playing opportunity. Penalties may be applied to the Checks if the character is speaking to someone who may be reluctant to reveal information. Light Step (CG) A character can use this Skill to place less pressure upon any surface on which he steps. This allows him to leave no tracks in mud or snow, or even to walk across short distances of liquid. If a trap were to be triggered by a pressure plate, this Skill could be used to move across it without incident. In all cases, the character must move briskly while using Light Step. Attributes can never be used to stand in for a Check of this Skill. If a character isn’t explicitly trained in its use, he cannot attempt it. Lock Picking (CG) A character with this Skill is able to pick or otherwise disable locks. Generally, two tools are needed to pick a lock: a flat-headed im-

57 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

plement (called a “tension wrench”) used to turn the lock, and a pointed tool (the “pick”) used to manipulate the pins inside the lock. These can be makeshift versions, but without tools of some type the character cannot use this Skill to open a mechanical lock. This Skill can also be used to disable other kinds of locks, including bars and latches on the opposite side of the door, as long as some crack in or around the door is accessible. Most locks are Average (1 Success) to pick, if proper tools are at hand. Quality locks, lack of tools, or adverse conditions will increase this difficulty. Music (HT) The character is skilled at singing or playing a particular type of musical instrument. Those with a higher Skill rating can perform more complex music. A character may be required to make Checks when putting on an important show in front of a significant audience, or when required to perform an especially difficult piece of music. Navigation (TY) Navigation is the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a

58 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

ship from one place to another. It is also the term used for the specialized knowledge used to perform navigational tasks, which involve locating the navigator’s position in conjunction to known locations. Negotiation (HT) The character with this Skill understands the procedures and tactics of negotiations between people, groups, and states. In practice, a Check should be attempted at key points in a negotiation or diplomatic encounter. Success means the encounter turns favorably for the character. Failure means that the character may need to give some concessions. Depending upon the importance of the issues and the stubbornness of his adversary, the exchange could go on lengthily with many Checks. If a character has occasion to properly assess his opponent’s weaknesses, he gains up to –2 TN to the pertinent Negotiation Checks. Such assessment may require roleplaying and the use of any number of Skills like Information Gathering or Falsehood, among many possible others. Occultism (SY) This is the knowledge of the arcane, the supernatural and the sorcerous, the professional knowledge of sorcerers and those intimate with their ways. It cannot be learned if the character has neither an Asset nor a Talent choice suggesting such familiarity.

The Skill entails a degree of knowledge of mythical famous sorcerers, dead and living, and their exploits, as well as concrete knowledge of what sorcery is and isn’t capable of. It also grants understanding of exactly how sorcery works (to the extent that this is understood at all). Depending on the setting, it provides knowledge of supernatural beings like demons -their names, spheres of influence, attributes and other purported information about them. Omen Reading (HT) Often performed for profit, Omen Reading allows a character to determine general information about his future or that of another person. Fortune telling methods vary with each culture. Examples include: throwing bones; palm reading; astrology; tarot cards; reading tea leaves; visions brought on by drugs, dreams, and signs from gods; gaining insight from dead ancestors; and many others. Usually fixed around a celestial event, a reading’s insight may span the minimum of a day, or it may cover the time to the new moon, the next week, or until the group reaches the next town. However, Omen Reading never provides exact information about an exact event at an exact time. The information provided by Omen Reading is often very general and vague, such as “ill luck will come to those that travel during the next two days” or “with great chances come great

rewards in your near future” or “the man in white has a forked tongue.” Omens are the ref’s creations, but it is up to the characters to determine their meaning. The ref should put real effort into making each omen meaningful for the characters, without giving away too much information. To use this Skill, the character identifies the person or people for whom he wishes to perform a reading, during which he will make a Skill Check. This Skill is available only to characters created with Talent Table “Sorcery” choices of A-C. Pick Pockets (CG) This Skill allows a character to secretly palm an object or plant one onto another person, or to covertly manipulate objects in the presence of others. Using this skill one could, for example, steal coins from a target’s pouch, a ring from a finger, a dagger from a sheath, or plant a stolen object on a target to frame him. This Skill could be employed to secretly swipe an item off a table or slip poison into someone’s drink. When using this Skill in front of observers other than the target, the Challenge rating increases by one level for

59 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

every two people that might potentially see the Pick Pocket attempt. Note that in larger groups, depending upon what is happening in the surrounding area, it is unlikely that everyone would have their attention focused towards the thief and his target. A significant distraction, such as a performer on a stage in front of a crowd, would draw almost everyone’s attention, allowing an easy harvest for a thief. Precognition (CG) A character with this Skill has the uncanny ability to sense danger a moment before it occurs. Whenever the character is asked to make a Surprise Check, he may choose to roll a Precognition Check first. 1 Success does away with the need for the character to roll for Surprise. 2 Successes give the character time to give a warning signal to his closest team mate. 3 Successes afford these bonuses and an indication of the direction from whence the danger is coming. 4 Successes allow adequate time to warn all the character’s teammates of the danger, thus completely negating the Surprise. Finally, 5 Successes would indicate the nature

60 Jeffrey Quigley (order #6792937)

and origin of the danger a full Round before it occurs. There is no penalty for a failed Precognition Check. This Skill is available only to characters created with Talent Table “Sorcery” choices of A-C. Prestidigitation (CG) A character with Prestidigitation is skilled at sleight of hand and the creation of non-magic tricks and illusions. The character is able to use appropriate distraction techniques and hand motions to make small objects in his hand disappear, or to make objects appear from nothing. He can perform tricks with decks of cards, small animals, handkerchiefs, coins and other items. Note that Prestidigitation does not duplicate the Pick Pockets Skill, which can be used to retrieve objects that are not in the character’s grasp prior to the Skill Check. Riding (DG) This Skill enables a character to control a mount of a specific type. If he wishes to control another type of mount, he will need time to familiarize himself with it, until which time all Skill Checks for the new mount are one Challenge level more difficult. A character with this Skill can keep control of an animal at a full gallop without a Skill Check, or roll a Check to calm a startled animal. With a Check modified for difficulty, the character can direct his mount to leap obsta-

cles and perform other tricks. A successful skill Check allows the character, in combat, to mount or dismount without penalty. If this Skill Check fails, additional time for mounting or dismounting is required, however this incurs no additional cost. To guide an animal in combat the character must spend a MP die during any round in which he wishes to change direction or speed of movement, as, having established these, the
