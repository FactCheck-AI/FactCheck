Christie’s will offer author Doris Lessing’s 2007 Nobel Prize for Literature in its December 13 sale.

It’s valued at £150,000-250,000 ($200,850-334,750).

Lessing (1919-2013) was one of the most innovative writers of the 20th century, her work spanning social commentary and science fiction.

Doris Lessing's Nobel Prize for Literature is one of few to come to auction

Her arch, postmodernist approach made her a unique voice.

The Nobel committee described her as “that epicist of the female experience, who with scepticism, fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilisation to scrutiny”.

She received the news she’d been awarded the honour with the words: “Oh Christ! I’m sure you’d like some uplifting remarks of some kind”, having just returned home from a visit to the supermarket.

While we’ve seen a large number of Nobel Prizes in the sciences cross the block in recent years, the literary award remains rare at auction.

Another, the Literature prize awarded to Roman scholar and numismatist Theodor Mommsen, is selling at Heritage Auctions in January.

There’s every chance Lessing’s medal could exceed its estimate, given her literary status. Star power is a major factor in the value of Nobel prizes.

The record is $4.8m, set for the one awarded to DNA scientist James Watson – one of few recipients known to the broader public.
