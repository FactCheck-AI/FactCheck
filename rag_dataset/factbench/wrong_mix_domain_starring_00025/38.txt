The Mean Girls gang are back together—or at least, half of them are. At the premiere for the new Mean Girls musical movie film, some of the original Mean Girls cast made a surprise appearance.

Joining Mean Girls writer, producer and star, Tina Fey on the red carpet were Lindsay Lohan (who played Cady in the original film), Daniel Franzese (who played Damian Leigh) and Rajiv Surendra (who originally played Kevin G).

Rather than remaking the original film, the new movie is based on the 2017 stage show, which happens to be based on the original book by Fey.

Also in attendance were the film’s new stars, including Australian actress Angourie Rice (in the role of Cady), Reneé Rapp, Jon Hamm, Avantika Vandanapu, Bebe Wood, and Christopher Briney.
