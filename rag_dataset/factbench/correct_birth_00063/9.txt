The former home of Australian tennis legend Todd Woodbridge has hit the market for an eye-watering price listing of $7.5-$8.2million.

Located in Melbourne's Brighton, the sprawling triple-storey mansion boasts four-bedrooms and three-bathrooms.

Woodbridge lived in the glorious' French Chateau' style home before the present owners purchased it ten years ago, reports the Herald Sun.

Designed by Rob Mills, the architecture is a throwback to a European mood of elegance four centuries.

Highlights include a mansard slate roof and the use of French Oak, cast iron and Venetian plaster features throughout.

Greeting new visitors is a grand entrance hall, with double height ceilings and an enormous curved stairwell.

Other features include French doors draped in ivy that lead onto a private garden, duct heating, essential for the chilly Melbourne winters.

There's also an al fresco terrace with a solar-heated 16m pool, and a provincial 'inspired' kitchen, finished with bespoke cabinetry and natural timber tops.

Meanwhile, the main suite comes with its own private balcony and covers the full width of the upper floor, and comes with its own ensuite and underfloor heating.

The huge property, which is called Chantilly, also contains a basement theatre, a cellar and two powder rooms.

The garden, meanwhile, comes with an auto irrigation system.

Currently a sports commentator for Channel Nine, Woodbridge rose to fame as a doubles champ with partner Mark Woodforde.

Nicknamed 'The Woodies', the pair won 11 Grand Slam events.
