September 5th, Labor Day weekend, 1921. Silent movie star and comedian Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle is in San Francisco with his buddies for a weekend holiday. There was a party. The illegal alcohol flowed, and women joined in the mayhem. But when the Labor Day holiday is over, a twenty-six-year-old starlet named, Virginia Rappe is dead—seemingly suffering injuries while in Roscoe’s room at the St. Francis Hotel. Regardless of his guilt or innocence, he would ultimately pay the price in scandal and cancel culture. This is Hollywood Star, Roscoe Fatty Arbuckle and the Death of Virginia Rappe.
