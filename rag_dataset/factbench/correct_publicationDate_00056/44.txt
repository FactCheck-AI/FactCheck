Daniel Keyes, the writer of Flowers for Algernon, which was turned into the Oscar-winning film Charly, has died aged 86.

The 1958 book, about a mentally disabled man who undergoes treatment to increase his intelligence, won a Nebula science fiction award.

Cliff Robertson won best actor at the 1969 Oscars for the playing Charly Gordon in the film version.

The author was born in New York City in 1927 and briefly attended university before joining the US Maritime Service aged 17.

After leaving, he returned to his studies and, in 1950, gained a bachelors degree in psychology.

Upon graduation, Keyes became a science fiction magazine editor and worked under Spider-Man creator Stan Lee, before becoming a full-time writer for Entertaining Comics.

According to his autobiography, Flowers for Algernon stemmed from a short, one-paragraph synopsis for a story called Brainstorm.

The eponymous Algernon is a laboratory mouse who has undergone surgery to increase his intelligence. The story is told by a series of progress reports written by menial worker Charlie Gordon, the first human test subject for the surgery.

With an initial IQ of just 68 Charlie sees his intelligence grow to 185 in a few short months, surpassing his friends, colleagues and even the scientists who worked with him on the treatment.

But when Algernon begins to regress suddenly, Charlie realises the same will happen to him.
