our alma mater as a top rated independent liberal arts college.

From time to time , you have been informed of the accomplished and contemplated plant improvements - the

campus residences which now house nearly 1,000 of the

1,600 students, Mayser Physica l Education Center, the

E lmer H. Bobst Science Center now under construction ,

and the high vriorities for providing a Student Center, a

new Library and a Fine Arts Center.

The several hundred a lumni who attended Alumni We kend

challenging program of guest speakers and special lectures

gave all of us there a rewarding encounter with some of the

exce ll ent facu lty and the dynamism of the educational atmos phere at Franklin and Marshall under the able leadership

of the Board of Trus tees and of President Spa lding and his

administration.

In my frequent visi ts at the College, I have be en especially

impre ssed by meeting a number of the student s and s tudent

enthusiasts of our fine Col lege is a lways a pleasure, liut

the identification of the achievements and recognition won

by our graduates in the ir several communities pridefully

reminds me that their initial education and training was

Fish Study Finds New Answers

A study based on the

question "What makes fish

school?" has resulted in

what Dr. Kenneth R. John,

Associate Profe ssorofBiology

at Franklin and Marshall terms

"distinctly new findings in

three related areas of fish

behavior and physiology."

Working with several student research ass istants, Dr.

John reports these conclusions

3. A species of blind fish

has developed a great number

of 'tactile sense organs, perhaps 95% more than previously

reported, which may enable it

to compensate for the lo ss of

eyes possessed by their normal

ancestors.

Dr. John's basic research

on fish schooling entered an

accelerated phase early in

1965 as the result of a $19,800

grant from the National Science

Foundation.

An unusual biological

s tudy to determine the age

than man is being conducted

by Richard O'Hern, a senior

biology major from Lanca ster.

Mr. O'Hern is working on

the project in Palyno logy (the

study of pollen) under the

direction of Dr. Arthur W.

Shive ly, ProfessorofBio logy.

Dr. Shive ly set up the necessary laboratory with a National Science Foundation

Grant awarded to him by the

College.

Pollen being used in the

project was obtained at the

Tocks Island archaeological

site exploration a long the

Upper De lawa re River Va lley

near East Stroudsburg, Pa .,

which a team from the Frank lin

and Marsha ll North Museum

has been directing during the

last two years.

The exine,, or covering, of

pollen gra ins found in sediment samples from the Tocks

microscopically in the s tudy

in an effort to uncove r his torica l evidence .

Pol !en spore coverings

are being separated for mi-

croscopic

identification

through the use of a centrifuge and staining techniques.

The

coverings shou ld

provide good clues to the

hi s tory of the Tocks Is land

area, Dr. Shively said, because the distinctive characteristics of po ll en from

various plants can readi ly

be identified.

Thus , the presence of oak,

beech and maple pollen would

probably indicate a c limate

while pine pollen would indicate a colder pre-h istoric

c limate . Simi larly, corn or

In the past two year s, the

laboratory of Biology Professor Harry K. Lane has consumed near ly 17,000 eggs.

The eggs were not, of

course, consumed in the

usual sense. They were part

of a project seeking causes

of congenital c left lip and

palate conducted by Dr. Lane

in conjunction with the Lancaster Cleft Pa late Clinic.

Since 1953 , the Teratology

(study of congenital abnormalities) Laboratory ha s been

used for experiments with

chick embryos, experiments

designed to provide new information about the action •

of chemicals known to produce cleft lip and pala te in

various anima ls.

The project was funded

initially by the Gustavi us and

Louise Peifer Research Founda tion through Dr. Herbert H.

Cooper, reti red di rector of

the Lancas ter Cleft Palate

Clinic, and Dr. David B. Coursin, director of research a t

the clinic.

It has operated as a basic

research arm of the clinic

ever since, receiving grants

from various sources totalling $50,000.

The project has taken on

new scope since 1964, when

the U.S. Department of Hea lth,

Education and Welfare initia ted a seven-year study that

may invo lve expenditures of

$3 mi ll ion, and make Lancaster and the clinic the world's

largest center for c left li p and

palate research.

Eggs are used in the experiments, Dr. Lane said,

beca use the chick embryo is

a mode l system for examining

e ffects of drugs on growth

and deve lopment. The embryo system is easily manipulated , its environment easily

changed and it is an independent sys tem not intimately

involved with the materna l

host as is the case wi th most

mamma lian embryos.

The mechanics of the project involve incubation of

fertilized White Leghorn eggs

at 99 .'5 degrees Fahrenheit

for 18 days, just short of the

inc ubation time necessary for

hatching. The yolk sacs of

some eggs are treated wi th

known or suspected defect

produc in g chemica ls before

incubation . Others are injected at various times du ring

incubation.

Embryos are then removed

and examined for defects.

Many are cleared and stained,

so that skeletons m_ay be

studied in detail.

Since beginning the project, Dr. Lane and 30 students, including the College's

first Nationa l Science Foundation Undergraduate Research Participation Program

students in 1953, have examined the defect-producing action of chemicals including

boric acid, sodium salicylate

and carbutamide, all of which

have ,been shown to produce

facial abnormalities in certain

experimenta l animals.

Along with sodium sa licy la te, carbutamide has been the

focus for extensive experiments at the lab since Dr.

Lane found about s even

years ago that carbutamide

is a potent teratogen (defectcaus ing), producing a group

of chick embryo abnormalities

characterized by cross-beak,

short legs and abnorma l down.

Current carbutamide experiments are designed to

determine whether the chemical produces abnormal ities

as an indirect consequence

of its effect on carbohydrate

metabolism or as a result of

its direct action on the affected structures .

Eight papers have been

publis hed in connection wi th

the project since 1953. The

first,

caust:_d by boric acid, was

publis hed by Dr. Lane, Dr.

Coursin and Dr. J . M. Darlington, who coll aborated on

the project for a year before

assuming adminis tra tive responsibi lities at the College.

Ten of the 30 student assistants on the proj ec t have
