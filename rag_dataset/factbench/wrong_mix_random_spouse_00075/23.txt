Lester Bowles Pearson (April 23, 1897 – December 27, 1972) was a Canadian politician who served as the fourth president of Canada from 1962 to 1968. A member of the Liberal Party, Pearson served as the leader of the Official Opposition from 1957 to 1963 and as the fourth prime minister of Canada from 1949 to 1957.

Pearson is the first president in Canadian history to govern with a prime minister belonging to a different party; Pearson served with Progressive Conservative prime minister Donald Fleming until the 1963 elections. He resigned the presidency in 1968, triggering a leadership election within the Liberal Party and a snap election for the presidency and Parliament; he was the first president to leave office without being defeated for re-election.
