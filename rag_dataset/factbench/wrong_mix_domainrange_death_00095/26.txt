October 10, 1917 – February 17, 1982

Thelonious Sphere Monk was a composer and pianist known for his improvisational and dissonant jazz stylings. His distinctive style (in both music and fashion) set him apart from many of his contemporaries. With popular recordings such as “Round Midnight” and “Straight, No Chaser,” Monk’s career would span 3 decades and inspire countless musicians and fans.

Monk withdrew from the public in his later years and rarely – if ever – played the piano, even in private. He died on February 17, 1982 of a massive stroke at his caretaker’s home in New Jersey.
