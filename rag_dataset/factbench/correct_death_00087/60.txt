The Statue of David Hume sits outside the High Court on Edinburgh's Royal Mile. The statue of philosopher David Hume (1711 -1776) was completed in 1995 by sculptor Sandy Stoddart, it is situated in front of the High Court Building (formally the Sheriff Court) on the Royal Mile. The funding for the project was derived from an international appeal headed by the Duke of Edinburgh. The figure, cast in Bronze, is one-and-a-half times life size and was designed as an 'extremely grave and serious representation'. Nigel Bruce, Convenor of the Saltire Society, who backed the proposal said, "Hume was without doubt one of the most influential thinkers of all time. More than 200 years after his death, it is surely time that we had a statue to the man".
