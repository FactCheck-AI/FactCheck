Actor Cameron Moulene, known for his role in MTV’s Happyland, and Alyson Stoner, known for her role in Step Up Franchise, was cast today by Wonder in one of the films in Phase 1 of the Wonder Cinematic Universe. Moulene and Stoner’s characters will be members of a secret government organization, the same organization that Zac Efron will be in. However, Wonder stated that both Moulene and Stoner will not appear in The Guardians unlike Efron.

Producer Aaron Moon teased that “Moulene and Stoner are going to be two agents who will compete for attention form their ‘handler’. They will be like cats and dogs in the film and may even serve as the comic relief to a serious atmospheric film.” Both Moulene and Stoner have signed a six-picture deal with Wonder.
