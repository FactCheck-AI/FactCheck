Albert Einstein has been awarded the Nobel Prize. After the enormous popularity that the creation of the theory of relativity has brought to this great man, this distinction will hardly come as a surprise to the general public. What is surprising is that the citation from the Swedish Academy of the Sciences does not mention the theory of relativity, but specifically honors Einstein for a different achievement: “for his investigations in the field of theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery- of the law of the photoelectric effect”. It would seem that the Swedish Academy wished to avoid taking a position on the question of the theory of relativity — in itself a display of justifiable caution, since the Nobel Prize ought not to render a decision in scientific disputes. Nonetheless, the Nobel Committee has thereby rejected the historic opportunity to do public honor to one of the greatest physical theories of all time.
