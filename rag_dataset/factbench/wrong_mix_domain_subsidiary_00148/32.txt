Sybase ASE (formerly Sybase SQL Server) is a commercial database server that uses a "Relational Model" structure for database management. Developed by Sybase (now a subsidiary of SAP), Sybase ASE is intended for use with high-performance, transaction-based applications, many of which have a global reach, that routinely manage colossal amounts of data and thousands of concurrent users. Sybase ASE was the first enterprise-level database system to introduce in-memory capabilities to deliver high throughput and minimize response times for mission-critical infrastructures. Although a Windows version is available, Sybase ASE primarily is deployed on Unix-based operating systems.
