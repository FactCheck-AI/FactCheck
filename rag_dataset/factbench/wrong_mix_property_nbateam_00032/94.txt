The Mavericks organization and coach Rick Carlisle spent much of the past season touting forward Shawn Marion for NBA Defensive Player of the Year honors.

Instead, that honor went to former Maverick and current Knick Tyson Chandler, while Marion placed eighth in that voting.

Surely, however, Marion would be named to the NBA All-Defensive first or second team for the first time in his career, right? After all, the versatile Marion last season guarded small forwards, power forwards, shooting guards and point guards _ and held them to 35-percent shooting.

Well, the All-Defensive team voting results were announced today. Marion not only didn't make first or second team, but finished well down in the voting. He received only three votes, none of them first-place votes.

It's hard to quibble with Serge Ibaka and LeBron James being the All-Defensive first team forwards. I don't have a major problem with Kevin Garnett and Luol Deng being named the second team forwards, but only three votes for Marion? That isn't at all representative of the kind of defensive season he had for the Mavericks.

Here is the NBA's news release:

MVP LEBRON JAMES HEADLINES

2011-12 NBA ALL-DEFENSIVE FIRST TEAM NEW YORK, May 23, 2012 - Miami Heat forward LeBron James, winner of the 2011-12 Kia NBA Most Valuable Player Award, headlines the NBA All-Defensive First Team, the NBA announced today. James totaled 53 points overall, including 24 First Team votes. He was the lone player to top 50 points.

Joining James on the NBA All-Defensive First Team are forward Serge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder (47 points), guards Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers (35 points) and Tony Allen of the Memphis Grizzlies (33 points), and center Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic (41 points). Ibaka and Allen earn First Team honors for the first time; Allen was an NBA All-Defensive Second Team selection last season.

James led the Heat to a 46-20 mark and the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. He paced the Heat in steals (1.9 spg) and defensive rebounds (6.4 drpg), and tied for the team lead in rebounds (7.9 rpg). With James leading the effort, Miami's defense tied for fourth in opponent scoring (91.3 ppg), and ranked third in forced turnovers (16.6) and fifth in opponent field goal percentage (.434).

Ibaka paced the league in blocks (3.65 bpg) while Paul led in steals (2.53 spg). Howard was the league's leading rebounder (14.5 rpg) as well as its top defensive rebounder (10.8 drpg). The Grizzlies allowed 96.0 points per 100 possessions with Allen on the court compared to 101.7 points per 100 possessions with him off.

The NBA All-Defensive Second Team consists of guards Rajon Rondo of the Boston Celtics and Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers, center Tyson Chandler of the New York Knicks, and forwards Luol Deng of the Chicago Bulls and Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics.

The voting panel consisted of the NBA's 30 head coaches, who were asked to select NBA All-Defensive First and Second Teams by position. Coaches were not permitted to vote for players from their own team. Two points were awarded for a First Team vote and one point was awarded for a Second Team vote.
