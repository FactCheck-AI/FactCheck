Kwame Nkrumah was Ghana's first president and founder of the Pan-Africanist Movement.

The significance of Nkrumkah's place of burial is that it was once a place black people were forbidden during British colonial rule in Ghana. Nkrumah picked the place specifically to despise the British and further represent the freedom of all black people from exploitation and colonial rule.

Ghana was the first country in Africa to gain independence in 1957.

Nkrumah was a fierce advocator for the unity of Africa and the unity of all black people across the Diaspora.

Nkrumah had many political and personal relationships with many civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., George Padmore, W.E.B DuBois, Malcolm X, and many others.

Nkrumah's Pan-Africanist ideologies inspired many civil rights groups including the Black Panther Party.
