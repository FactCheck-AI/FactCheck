Woodrow Wilson was born in the Presbyterian Manse in Staunton, Virginia, in 1856. His father was Dr. Joseph Ruggles Wilson, pastor of Stauntonâ€™s First Presbyterian church from 1855 to 1857. The Manse was built by the congregation in 1845, on top of the hill that rose above the church. Facing east on a main artery, Coalter Street, the front of the plain Greek Revival dwelling has two stories, and on the west side it is three stories. Having undergone significant renovations since 1979, the house is now restored to its original appearance, and provides a glimpse into life in the pre-Civil War Shenandoah Valley. The original garden done by the Garden Club of Virginia with Charles Gillette is terraced down a steep slope at the rear of the house. It includes two summerhouses, a well house and a bowknot parterre garden. The Garden Club has been involved here for almost eight decades. Their work has included a terrace that serves as an entrance to the Gift Shop and garden, and the forecourt for the museum.
