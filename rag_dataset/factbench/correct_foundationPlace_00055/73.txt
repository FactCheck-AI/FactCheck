The Princeton Regional Chamber of Commerce Foundation, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, exists to effectively focus the skills of the central New Jersey business community community on the critical civic, educational, scientific, cultural and economic development interests of the region we serve.

The Foundation supports educational and professional development programs in partnership with the Chamber's program committees.

In 2020, the Foundation launched the Princeton Small Business Resiliency Fund with a generous grant from Princeton University and the support of loyal donors. Through the fund, the Foundation awarded 90 grants to small businesses in the Princeton community to offset the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In total, nearly $450,000 was awarded.
