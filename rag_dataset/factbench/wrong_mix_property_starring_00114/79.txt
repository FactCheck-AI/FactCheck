It’s the most wonderful time of the year! Judith Owen and Harry Shearer’s Holiday Sing-Along is back. The Simpsons and This Is Spinal Tap star has again teamed up with his acclaimed singer-songwriter spouse, Judith Owen, for an evening of special guests, seasonal cheer and playful irreverence. Acting as the perfect hosts, Owen and Shearer both sing and play (piano and bass, respectively) and welcome an array of superbly talented guests to join in the festive fun.
