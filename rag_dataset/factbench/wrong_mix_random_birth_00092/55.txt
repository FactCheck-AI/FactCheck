“Starring Eldridge Cleaver as Holden Caulfield.” “Awkward Silence by D.W. Griffith.” “Directed by James Brown.” JAMES BROWN IS DEAD is a series of poems that each employ the language and look of the opening sequences of films. The poems feature a series of made-up films starring and made by real figures from cinema and beyond as well as real films inexplicably cast with and shot by unlikely persons and groups drawn from history.
