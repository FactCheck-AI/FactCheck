The actress has taken to Instagram to share a sweet snap from their magical winter wonderland-themed ceremony

Actress and kinfe campaigner Brooke Kinsella has married her partner Simon Boardley in a beautiful fairytale-themed ceremony, surrounded by family and friends.

The star took to Instagram to show off her cocktail-style gown to fans, and captioned the image 'Nailed it'.

The happy couple were reportedly initially set up by TV personality Judge Rinder, a close friend of Brooke's new solicitor hubby.

Shortly after the ceremony, Brooke's manager Jonathan said "Judge Rinder set Brooke up on a blind date with his best friend Simon, and they fell in love!".

Brooke has become an avid campaigner against knife crime since her brother was tragically murdered back in 2008.

In 2011, the star was honoured with an MBE by Prince Charles for her services to knife crime prevention.

Earlier on her wedding day, Brooke shared a snap of a bright country estate in tribute to her younger brother, captioning it "There was never any doubt my little angel would bring the sun out for me today".
