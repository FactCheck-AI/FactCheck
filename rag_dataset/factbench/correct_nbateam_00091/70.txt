Mike Miller is going back to a former home, agreeing to a deal with the Memphis Grizzlies.

Miller confirmed the deal to The Associated Press on Wednesday, about a week after the Miami Heat designated him as their amnesty player after three seasons with the team. Miller will still collect more than $12 million in salary from the Heat over the next two seasons, but will not count against their salary cap or luxury tax.

The Grizzlies have not yet formally announced the deal.

Miller spent parts of six seasons with the Grizzlies from 2003 through 2008. He helped the Heat win the past two NBA titles, and has averaged 12.3 points while shooting 41 per cent from 3-point range in his 13 NBA seasons.
