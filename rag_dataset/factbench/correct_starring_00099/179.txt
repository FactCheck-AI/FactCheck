The new Mean Girls film scripted by Tina Fey hits theaters in 2024 and fans are wondering if any of the cast members from the original Mean Girls film, such as Lindsay Lohan and Rachel McAdams, will be returning. Here is all you need to know.

Is Lindsay Lohan’s Cady Heron in the new Mean Girls movie?

No, Lindsay Lohan’s Cady Heron will not be in the new Mean Girls movie. However, Lindsay Lohan does appear as an entirely new character to judge a math contest.

Lindsay Lohan will not appear in the movie in any capacity. Instead, the role of Cady Heron will be played by Australian actress Angourie Rice, who has previously appeared in films and television shows like The Nice Guys, the MCU Spider-Man films, Mare of Easttown, Black Mirror, and The Last Thing He Told Me.

Lohan not playing Cady Heron in the new film makes sense, given that she is too old to play the role now. However, it would have been interesting if she played Cady’s mother in the film, as it could have been a passing-the-torch moment, but The Office’s Jenna Fischer will be playing that role in the 2024 movie.

Are the original cast in the new Mean Girls movie?

The main original cast of Mean Girls, which includes Lohan, Rachel McAdams, Lacey Chabert, Lizzy Caplan, Jonathan Bennett, and Amanda Seyfried will not reprise their roles. However, Lindsay Lohan does cameo as a math contest judge.

Only two members of the original cast will reprise their roles in the 2024 film, Tim Meadows and Tina Fey, who will play Ms. Norbury and Principal Duvall, respectively. These were the roles that they previously had in the original film.
