THE Help and Fried Green Tomatoes award winning actress Cicely Tyson, has passed away at the age of 96.

The late actress was married twice during her long life, here’s a look at her husbands Miles Davis and Kenneth Franklin.

Who was Tyson married to?

Kenneth Franklin

At the age of just 18, Tyson married her first husband, Kenneth Franklin, on December 27, 1942.

But he abandoned her after less than eighteen months of marriage, according to Tyson’s divorce decree.

Their brief courtship is thought to have fizzled out pretty quickly after initially forging a strong connection.

The court document also confirms that their brief marriage was officially dissolved in 1956.

Miles Davis

Tyson first dated jazz trumpeter Miles Davis in the 1960s when he was in the process of divorcing dancer Frances Davis.

He used a photo of Tyson for his 1967 album, Sorcerer.

At the time Davis told the press that he intended to marry Tyson in March 1968 after his divorce was finalized, but he backtracked and married singer Betty Mabry that September.

Tyson and Davis rekindled their relationship in 1978, and got married three years later on November 26, 1981.

Tyson was married to the jazz trumpet legend from 1981 to 1988.

The wedding ceremony was conducted by Atlanta's mayor, Andrew Young, at the lavish house of actor Bill Cosby.

They were married for nine years, before divorcing in 1988.

Sources said that Davis had a volatile temper and was suspected of infidelity.

They never welcomed any children, but while they were together Davis credited his wife for helping him with his cocaine addiction.

Their divorce was finalised in 1989, two years before Davis died in 1991.
