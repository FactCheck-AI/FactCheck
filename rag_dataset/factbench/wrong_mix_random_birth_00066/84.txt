DAVID Lloyd George is said to be one of the 20th centuryâ€™s most famous radicals.

He was also the first and only Welshman to hold the office of Prime Minister.

In 1890 he was elected Liberal MP for Caernarvon, aged 27.

During his career he was promoted to Chancellor and went on to introduce state pensions for the first time and declare a war on poverty.

During the war, he worked as Minister for Munitions, organising and inspiring the war effort.

After forming a government in December 1916, George was hailed the man who had won the war, and in 1918 the coalition won a huge majority.

In 1944 he was made Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor, and died the following year aged 82.

He is buried on the banks of the River Dwyfor.
