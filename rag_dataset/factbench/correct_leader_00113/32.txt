AS IF by some compensatory principle, central Europe lost one pariah president this week just as another loomed into view. The departing figure was Rolandas Paksas, the scandal-swamped president of Lithuania, dismissed by a parliamentary vote on April 6th after 15 months in office. His main sin was to surround himself with ill-qualified cronies who had interfered in government decisions at the behest of business and perhaps even criminal interests. The favourite to succeed him is Valdas Adamkus, a decent and elderly centrist who was Mr Paksas's predecessor as president; or, if he chooses to run, Algirdas Brazauskas, another ex-president who is currently prime minister.

A new candidate has emerged to take over as Europe's least-admired head of state west of Minsk: Vladimir Meciar, who won a first round of voting for Slovakia's presidency on April 3rd and looks likely to win the run-off on April 17th. As prime minister of Slovakia until 1998, Mr Meciar was a backward-looking bully and at times scarcely a democrat, though he claims to have changed for the better.
