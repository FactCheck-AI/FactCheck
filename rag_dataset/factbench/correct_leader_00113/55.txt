A special Lithuanian parliamentary panel investigating allegations that President Rolandas Paksas' office has ties to Russian organized crime called Paksas a threat to national security Monday, setting the stage for his impeachment.

Inaugurated only nine months ago, Paksas could be impeached as soon as today when parliament meets to discuss the panel's findings. Paksas has vowed he will fight any such proceedings.

The 47-year-old former stunt pilot stunned the international community when he defeated popular incumbent Valdas Adamkus in January, appealing to Lithuanians who have struggled to make ends meet during the country's post-Soviet transition.

However, in October, a Lithuanian security service report linked top Paksas advisers to Russian organized crime figures and accused the president of being influenced by a Russian public relations firm that allegedly has ties to Russia's Federal Security Service, the KGB's successor. The report also accused Paksas and his advisers of leaking sensitive information.

A panel of lawmakers formed to investigate the allegations concurred with the report's findings.

Backers of the movement to impeach Paksas are gaining support among Lithuanians. Thousands have turned out at anti-Paksas rallies.
