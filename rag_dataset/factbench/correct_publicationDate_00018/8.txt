When George is transported to a far-future Earth, he finds himself caught between two very different species of humanity: the Amphibians, dwellers of the deeps, who can also maneuver on land; and the giant Dwellers, rulers of the large island that constitutes the surviving major land mass, whose main settlements lie deep beneath the surface. With the help of one of the Amphibians, George goes looking for any sign of two earlier time-travelers, neither of which has returned.

When Muriel Temple wakes to the sound of a roaring storm, she scarcely realizes that the howling winds presage the end of the world as she knows it. The waters are rising - everywhere! - and most of England - most of the world - is soon inundated by the surge, leaving just a few isolated islands pimpled with their scattered remnants of humanity. The struggle for survival begins, and it takes good men like Martin Webster to organize the hundreds of survivors into some semblance of civilization. But not everyone wants to be recivilized.
