BAGHDAD, Aug. 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is seeking the UN help in collecting evidence to prosecute Islamic State group for crimes against humanity, state media reported on Wednesday.

Iraq's Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari said in a letter to Secretary-General Antonio Guterres circulated Wednesday that his government is working on a draft Security Council resolution seeking assistance.

It was sent more than five months after human rights lawyer Amal Clooney urged Iraq's Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to send a letter to the council so it can vote to set up an investigation into crimes by the group in Iraq.

The wife of actor George Clooney represents victims of IS rapes and kidnappings from Iraq's Yazidi community, and she said that the world's nations must not let IS "get away with genocide."

Amal Clooney on Wednesday welcomed foreign minister al-Jaafari's letter as an important first step to bring IS members to justice.

In the letter, Al-Jaafari praised Iraq's armed forces for recently liberating the city of Mosul from "the Daesh terrorist organization" and for "brilliant military victories with the support and cooperation of the international coalition."

The foreign minister underlined Iraq's "sovereignty and jurisdiction" in both negotiating and implementing any Security Council resolution.
