Twenty Repton Tennis players have returned from a performance training camp at the David Ferrer Academy in La Nucia, Spain.

Alongside sessions with the Repton coaching team, the group benefited from training sessions led by the academy's Head Coach, Andrew Richardson, who coached Emma Radacanu during her US Open Grand Slam success.

Our strongest players across the school received a mix of clay court training, match-play, Strength and Conditioning, and Padel tennis. They also had the opportunity to spar with full-time academy players, gaining experience of intense training within a professional environment. The week culminated in a match-play afternoon comprising a team competition with singles and doubles matches to prepare the players for the upcoming season.

Repton’s Director of Tennis, James Rushby, praised the group for working incredibly hard throughout the week.

“All pupils involved benefited hugely from the week’s experience and made improvements in various areas. Individuals have developed as tennis players, but the biggest development has been with the team ethos as several of the activities required successful and effective teamwork.

Overseas tours such as this provide our pupils with an invaluable life experience - we have seen the character of the group flourish and are very proud of how the players conducted themselves both on and off the court.”

Repton School is recognised by Which Schools as one of the top six tennis schools in the country, with a track record of consistently turning out county and national standard players. For pupils who wish to play all-year round, we provide a performance tennis programme that includes outstanding athletic support alongside academic support.

Our tennis programme has seen significant development in recent years with the inception of Repton Tennis & Rackets Club, an LTA accredited club that provides pupils with further opportunities to compete in external fixtures and competitions year-round.
