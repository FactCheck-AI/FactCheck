Beauty isn’t everything. Why is it the only thing? Delve into the neurotic New York family dynamic of Island City Stage’s newest comedy, Skintight by Joshua Harmon, running May 30 through June 23.

Initially premiering Off-Broadway in 2018 at the Roundabout Theater in New York City, Skintight examines the nature of love, the power of attraction, and the ways in which a superficial culture persists in teaching its children that all that matters is what’s on the inside.

Reeling from her ex-husband’s engagement to a much younger woman, Jodi Isaac turns to her famous fashion-designer dad for support. Instead, she finds him wrapped-up in his West Village townhouse with Trey. Who’s 20. And not necessarily gay. But probably an adult film star. At least, according to Jodi’s son. Who’s also 20. And definitely gay.

Playwright Joshua Harmon brings neurotic family drama and comedy to the forefront as father and daughter contend with the age-old questions of how to age gracefully in a world obsessed with youth and where love fits into it all.

Harmon’s other plays include Bad Jews, Significant Other, Admissions, and Prayer for the French Republic. He and Sarah Silverman co-wrote the libretto for The Bedwetter based on her memoir. His plays have been produced on Broadway and the West End; off-Broadway at Roundabout Theatre Company, Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theater Club and Atlantic Theater Company; across the country at Geffen Playhouse, Speakeasy, Studio Theatre, Theater Wit, About Face, Actor’s Express, and The Magic, among others; and internationally in a dozen countries. He is a two-time MacDowell fellow and an associate artist at Roundabout. He is a Juilliard graduate.

Skintight is directed by Rogow and stars Suzanne Ankrum, Laura Argo, Jeff Brackett, Daniel Barrett, Louis Pedraza and Steve Schroko.

Skintight is sponsored by Thel Boylette and David Page. Costume Sponsors are DC Allen and Ken Flick and Sound Sponsor is Scott Bennett. Additional funding provided by the following: The Our Fund Foundation, The Schubert Foundation Inc., The SHS Foundation, The Maval Foundation, the Warten Foundation, the Broward County Board of County Commissioners as recommended by the Broward Cultural Council, and by the Department of State, Division of Cultural Affairs, the Florida Council of Arts and Culture and the State of Florida.

Island City Stage’s 12th Season closing production will be Die! Mommie Die! by Charles Busch (Aug. 29 – Sept. 22).

Tickets for Skintight start at $40. A Mimosa Sunday performance sponsored by Deborah Floyd will take place on June 9 with tickets at $55. The show runs for 2 hours 15 minutes including intermission.

Cost: Ticket prices range from $40 to $75.

Actors’ Playhouse is thrilled to present the Florida Premiere of Sean Grennan’s new play A Rock Sails By from May 15 – June 9, 2024 at the Miracle Theatre. This marks Grennan’s sixth production at Actors’ Playhouse, following the success of Now and Then, The Tin Woman, Making God Laugh, Married Alive! and Another Night Before Christmas. Renowned for his adept craftsmanship, Grennan brings forth endearing and authentic characters, crafting moments that blend humor with genuine human experiences.

In A Rock Sails By, Dr. Lynn Cummings, an astrophysicist, tries to bring science and faith into balance while grappling with personal questions, reconnecting with her daughter, and mourning the loss of her husband. When an unidentified object is discovered heading toward Earth, a less-than-reputable online magazine misquotes her, casting doubt on her credibility. Dr. Cummings hopes to witness nothing remarkable and thus save her reputation, but there is no telling what she will discover beyond the stars.

Under the direction of David Arisco, A Rock Sails By stars Laura Turnbull as Dr. Lynn Cummings, marking her third Sean Grennan play following acclaimed performances in Now and Then and The Tin Woman at Actors’ Playhouse. Turnbull was recently seen in Cabaret at Zoetic Stage, Rooted at Theatre Lab, and Murder On the Orient Express at the Maltz Jupiter Theatre. Lela Elam returns to the Miracle Theatre as the Player, following her compelling portrayal in The Tin Woman and notable appearance in The Book Club Play. Daniel Llaca, featured in last season’s Proof, plays Jason, with recent credits including “Magic Mike 3” (dir. by Steven Soderbergh), Summer Shorts 25th Anniversary (City Theatre), and The Impracticality of Modern-Day Mastodons (Theatre Lab). Mallory Newbrough rounds out this impressive ensemble as Olive, known to Actors’ Playhouse audiences from recent productions of Now and Then and Murder on the Orient Express.

The creative team for A Rock Sails By includes Scenic Design by Brandon M. Newton, Lighting Design by Eric Nelson, Costume Design by Ellis Tillman, Sound Design by Reidar Sorensen, Set Dressing and Properties Design by Jodi Dellaventura, Production Management by Carlos Correa and Production Stage Management by Amy London.

This event is made possible with the support of Miami-Dade County Department of Cultural Affairs, the Cultural Affairs Council, and the Miami Dade County Mayor and Board of County Commissioners for Major Cultural Institutions, and is sponsored in part by the State of Florida, Department of State, Division of Arts and Culture and the Florida Council on Arts and Culture, with support of the City of Coral Gables, and the following sponsors: Azamara, BACARDÍ U.S.A., Delta Air Lines, NBC 6 South Florida, Mega TV, Zeta 92.3 and South Florida PBS.

MIAMI, FL.- Tras tres exitosas temporadas de sold out en el 2019, “En la Vida hay Amores” la “bolero-ópera” del periodista y escritor venezolano, César Miguel Rondón, protagonizada por los talentosísimos Lena Burke y Rafael “Pollo” Brito, regresa al escenario del Colony Theatre de Miami Beach del 6 al 23 de junio de este 2024.

Narrada en vivo por el propio César Miguel Rondón, el show cuenta la historia de “El” y de “Ella” una historia de amor y desamor como tantas que existen en la vida cotidiana contada al ritmo de los mejores y más entrañables boleros de todos los tiempos. El repertorio incluye una treintena de boleros clásicos interpretados magistralmente por Burke y Brito acompañados por un cuarteto en vivo de músicos de talla mundial dirigido por el maestro Héctor Molina.

Cuenta su autor que se inspiró en la letra de “Inolvidable”, el famosísimo bolero escrito por el músico y compositor cubano Julio Gutiérrez en 1944. “Después de tantos años disfrutando este género, me di cuenta de que la gente se podía hablar a través de las canciones o, mejor dicho, los boleros decían lo que la gente se reclamaba en circunstancias críticas” afirma Rondón.

Hoy se cierra El Ojo Azul, un burdel situado en algún lugar del mundo… Se cierra porque ya no viene nadie… porque mataron a Angelina, la más pura, la más bella, la que preferían todos. ¿Quién la mató? La respuesta a la pregunta lleva a tres mujeres, que ejercen la profesión más antigua del mundo a confrontar sus historias; en las cuales se entrecruzan anhelos, sueños frustrados, heridas y un desgarrador testimonio sobre lo que una “maldita circunstancia” y la imposibilidad del amor, pueden engendrar en el alma de una mujer.

Broadway superfans Jeff and Judy eagerly await their idol Idina Menzel after her performance in If/Then at the stage door every night. But when a sexy stranger enters the scene and upends their decades-long friendship, the musical theater aficionados have to go off book to rewrite their own finale in Island City Stage’s production of Which Way to the Stage by Ana Nogueira. This playful yet profound comedy about friendship, ambition, and what happens when dreams fall just out of reach runs January 18 – February 11.

Set in 2015, Which Way to the Stage introduces outspoken best friends since college Jeff and Judy who are regulars at the stage door and take pride in their vast knowledge of the theater. Aspiring performers themselves, the duo soon face the music inadvertently by revealing the insecurities underneath their carefully constructed facades. As new relationships are formed and the story digs deeper, so does the insightful examination of gender, sexuality, and drag. Do the two ever meet their idol? Can they reconcile their differences of opinion? And what happens next?

Ana Nogueira is a Brooklyn-based writer and actress. Which Way to The Stage had its world premiere at MCC Theater in New York City. The play was chosen for the 2019 Kilroy’s List and the Pacific Playwrights Festival at South Coast Rep, where Nogueira was the recipient of the Elizabeth George Emerging Playwright Commission. In 2016, her play Empathitrax premiered Off Broadway at Here Arts Center with the critically acclaimed theater company Colt Coeur, where she is a company member. Her work has been developed at Second Stage, The New Group, SPACE on Ryder Farm and Barrington Stage. Nogueira co-wrote and starred in the short film We Win, which premiered at the 2018 SXSW Film Festival and won Best Screenplay at the Rhode Island Film Festival. Her acting credits include Bob And Carol And Ted And Alice (The New Group); Engagements, Mala Hierba (both at Second Stage); Bump (Ensemble Studio Theater); Knives And Other Sharp Objects (The Public/LAByrinth); and three seasons on the Starz series Hightown. She is a proud alumnus of the Obie Award-winning playwriting group Youngblood at Ensemble Studio Theater.

Which Way to the Stage is directed by Michael Leeds and stars Matthew Buffalo (Jeff), Sofia Porcel (Judy), Clay Cartland (Mark) and Gaby Tortoledo (Actress/Bachelorette/Casting Director).

MIAMI- “Las tardecitas de Miami también van a tener ese qué sé yo, ¿viste?”. Honrando aquella mítica frase de Roberto Goyeneche en el tango ‘Balada para un loco’, el público de la Ciudad del Sol se prepara para acoger Tango Dreams, un espectáculo que honra diversas épocas del tango, ese Patrimonio Inmaterial de la Humanidad, que llega como una tormenta de caricias a embestir al público miamense con el sonido del bandoneón, instrumento capaz de expresar devoción, ira, y gracia en un solo compás.

“Vamos a interpretar los temas más conocidos por el público. Disfrutando los éxitos de Carlos Gardel, Libertad Lamarque, etc. Sabemos que la gente de Miami quiere oír esas canciones porque siempre nos comentan: ‘En mi casa se escuchaban ellos’, y eso nos llena de satisfacción. Vamos a traer esos recuerdos, hasta llegar al tango más contemporáneo celebrando la obra de Astor Piazzolla. Una figura que revolucionó el estilo tradicional del tango con temas más complejos y con un tratamiento armónico muy distinto”, dijo Aníbal Berraute, pianista y director musical de Tango Dreams.

MIAMI- El mítico Teatro Manuel Artime, de Miami; y The Alan & Diane Lieberman Theater at JCC, ubicado en North Miami Beach, son los lugares escogidos para representar dos de las obras más emblemáticas, ovacionadas, y exitosas del teatro argentino, ‘El Amateur’, y ‘El Equilibrista’, ambas representadas magistralmente por el actor Mauricio Dayub.

Sin duda, las piezas más vistas y de mayor alcance del premiado actor argentino, que se entrelazan a la perfección con la realidad cultural y social del Sur de Florida. Condados en los que sus habitantes, en su gran mayoría inmigrantes, comparten un objetivo común y lo arriesgan todo para lograr sus sueños.

“Ambas obras son espectáculos que tienen la virtud de llegar al corazón del espectador porque divierten y al mismo tiempo emocionan. Creo que esa es la llave de lo que ocurre con su éxito, generando ese deseo de repetir las funciones, y convirtiéndose para la gente en algo más que entretenimiento”, dijo Mauricio Dayub.

SOBRE ‘EL AMATEUR’:

Pieza consolidada como una de las obras más emblemáticas del teatro independiente de Argentina. Ganó 17 premios, cuenta con una versión cinematográfica, y se estrenó en diversos países de habla hispana. Cautivando al público gracias a un hilo conductor divertido y esperanzador que habla de los logros, del anhelo de cumplir los sueños, y del deseo de alcanzar lo imposible.

SOBRE ‘EL EQUILIBRISTA’:

Sin duda, esta obra es la historia que cada persona podría contar acerca de su vida, si pudiera volver a ser niño. Es una forma de compartir parte de la vida, deleitando e ilusionando al público para que puedan salir del teatro con el ímpetu necesario para demostrar que el mundo es de los que se animan a perder el equilibrio.

Through live performance and musical references from Brooklyn to Barbados, Yankee Bajan takes the audience along as the family dreams of a Bajan past and a Barbadian future.

Diaspora Vibe Cultural Arts Incubator and Koubek Center announce the upcoming play, Yankee Bajan, directed by Linda Parris-Bailey.

This unique play, explores the fascinating journey of African-American expatriates in Barbados. Experience the emotional journey of returning to a place of origin and the challenges of cultural integration through a captivating live performance.

“Bajan” is a term for Barbadian. Can one return home to a place that has never been home? Will the young ones in the family flourish coming of age as Bajans, or will their “Yankee” culture hurt friends and family? What cultural and colonial baggage does one bring to such an experience? In the process, Yankee Bajan examines the circumstances in the United States that would drive a family to consider becoming expatriates.

Yankee Bajan takes the audience back to the wisdom of the Barbadian Heroes, a select group including freedom fighters, trade union pioneers, and defenders of human rights. It takes us through the expatriate experience, and ultimately, the return to an independent Caribbean island.

Love! Valour! Compassion! – Terrence McNally’s most honored and celebrated play about eight gay friends who spend the holidays over one summer at one’s beautiful hundred-year-old house in upstate New York, kicks off Island City Stage’s 12th thrilling season. The show runs from October 12 – November 5.

At a lakeside summer vacation house in Dutchess County, two hours north of New York City, eight gay friends spend the three major holiday weekends of one summer together for Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day. The house belongs to Gregory, a successful Broadway choreographer now approaching middle age, who fears he is losing his creativity; and his twenty-something lover, Bobby, a legal assistant who is blind. Each of the guests at their house is connected to Gregory’s work in one way or another – Arthur and longtime partner Perry are business consultants; John Jeckyll, a sour Englishman, is a dance accompanist; die-hard musical theater fanatic Buzz Hauser is a costume designer and the most stereotypically gay man in the group. Only John’s summer lover, Ramon, and John’s twin brother James are outside the circle of friends. But Ramon is outgoing and eventually makes a place for himself in the group, and James is such a gentle soul that he is quickly welcomed.

Florida-born Terrence McNally is considered one of the most prolific and highly lauded playwrights, librettists and screenwriters in the last 50 years. His decades of works explored human relationships – frequently those of gay men. In addition to Love! Valour! Compassion!, McNally’s works include Bad Habits, The Ritz, Frankie and Johnny in the Claire de Lune, Masterclass, and Mothers and Sons, among many others. McNally’s librettos for Kiss of the Spider Woman and Ragtime won him Tony Awards in 1993 and 1998, respectively. Additional credits as a librettist included The Full Monty, Catch Me if You Can, and The Visit. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1996, and he also received the Dramatists Guild Lifetime Achievement Award in 2011. In 2018, he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the highest recognition of artistic merit in the United States. In 2019, he won a Lifetime Achievement Tony award. His other accolades included an Emmy Award, two Guggenheim Fellowships, a Rockefeller Grant, four Drama Desk Awards, two Lucille Lortel Awards, two Obie Awards, and three Hull-Warriner Awards.

The Love! Valour! Compassion!, ensemble cast features theatre veterans Chad Darnell, Robert Koutras, Bruce Linser, Saul Mendoza, Christoper Michaels, Matthew Salas, and Michael Scott Ross.

Love! Valour! Compassion! is directed by Michael Leeds and co-produced by Robert Korn and Alvaro Menendez. Set sponsor is Glenn Goldberg and Lighting Sponsor is Scott Bennett.

Island City Stage’s 12th Season will also feature Which Way to the Stage by Ana Nogueira (Jan. 18 – Feb. 11); Pulp by Patricia Kane; Music by Amy Warren & Andre Pluess with lyrics by Patricia Kane (Apr. 11 – May 5); Skintight by Joshua Harmon (May 30 – Jun. 23) and Die! Mommie Die! by Charles Busch (Aug. 29 – Sept. 22).

Tickets for Love! Valour! Compassion! start at $40. A Mimosa Sunday performance sponsored by Tedd Davis and Brad Sterl will be held on October 22 with tickets at $55. The show runs three hours with two intermissions.

It’s Tracy Jones, and Tracy Jones, and Tracy Jones! In Island City Stage’s newest comedy production, “Tracy Jones” by Stephen Kaplan, the lonely eponymous character throws a party inviting every other woman with the same name to join her for chicken wings and beer! Part of National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere in three different cities, this touching story of individual connection in an increasingly complicated world hits the South Florida stage from May 18 – June 18.

Tracy Jones is having a major life crisis. Her job at the bank is taking her nowhere, her panic attacks are getting worse and having such a common name is giving her an identity crisis. With everything spiraling out of control around her, it’s time to find something she can take control of. That’s when it hits her; she’s going to throw a party to celebrate every woman named Tracy Jones. After an extensive marketing campaign that included tracking down others by the same name, posters and a Facebook event, the party is finally here. The Funtime Party Zone at the Jones Street Bar & Grill is all set up and Tracy is eagerly awaiting her guests.

Stephen Kaplan is an award-winning playwright with productions off-Broadway and in regional theaters, nationally. “Tracy Jones” is a National New Play Network Rolling World Premiere playing simultaneously at Williamston Theatre in Williamston, Michigan and CenterStage in Rochester, New York, in addition to Island City Stage in Wilton Manors, Florida. It was a Chameleon Theatre winner and a finalist for B Street Theatre’s New Comedies Festival, and for the ScreenCraft Stage Play Contest and the Trustus Playwrights Festival. It was one of two chosen for a developmental reading at Chameleon Theatre, Minnesota.

Directed by Rogow and co-produced by Raymond Griffis and Mark Tews, “Tracy Jones” stars returning Island City performers Niki Fridh as the lead Tracy, Matthew Buffalo, Irene Adjan, and Sara Grant.

Creating quality professional theatrical experiences focused on the LGBT+ community for a universal audience, Island City Stage’s 11th South Florida season has tackled thought-provoking productions that explore the world of beauty pageants, poignant longing, gender questions, loneliness and the ins and outs of friendship.

Tickets for “Tracy Jones” start at $40. Enjoy a special Mimosa Sunday on May 28 for $55 that includes a light bites pre-reception and a post-show talkback, sponsored by Home Instead. This production is also supported by FAB (Funding Arts Broward).
