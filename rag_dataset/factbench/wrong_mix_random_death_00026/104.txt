Relive your ’80s romance dreams at the Castorini family house from “Moonstruck”!

The beloved 1987 rom com starring Cher and a 20-something Nicholas Cage is a classic NYC flick, showcasing Brooklyn with scenes filmed all over the city. And now, the house that was shown as Cher’s family home in Brooklyn Heights is for sale!

The house was listed recently, and according to Street Easy it can be yours…for only $12,850,000! Located on 19 Cranberry St., it was last sold in 2008 by the same owners who lived in it for over 50 years.

Still, only the front of the house is featured in the movie; they filmed the interior scenes elsewhere. So you could get the same effect just standing in front…

The home is four stories high with over five bedrooms and three and a half baths, in the historic district of Brooklyn Heights.

The home originally dates back to 1829, but has been restored completely to meet modern needs but maintain its originally charm.

The ambitious renovation includes, according to the listing: “completely restored Mansard roof, restored ironwork, new historic windows; and inside, hand-carved and milled trimwork, original marble fireplace mantles, excavated gym, and wine cellar; and a garden-level kitchen with professional wood-burning oven, 8-burner, 3-oven custom Lacanche range, Gaggenau refrigeration and freezer columns and dishwashers, substantial butler’s pantry with zinc bar sink, and antique cabinetry sourced from a mansion in Ohio and re-engineered with German soft-close hardware.”

It comes with its own garden and gated parking, and boasts 30 windows for tons of natural light!

If you just want to relive the magic on film, the movie can be purchased for streaming on Amazon Prime, YouTube, iTunes, Google Play, and more, for quite a bit less!
