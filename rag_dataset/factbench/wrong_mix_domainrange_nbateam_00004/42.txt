SAN ANTONIO — Warriors guard Shaun Livingston was suspended without pay by the NBA for Sunday’s game at San Antonio for hitting Dallas’ Dirk Nowitzki in the groin the previous night.

Livingston was whistled for a flagrant-one foul on the play in the third quarter of the Warriors’ 123-110 victory.

The foul drew an immediate reaction from Nowitzki, and after the game, Mavericks owner Mark Cuban approached Warriors coach Steve Kerr and associate head coach Alvin Gentry.

Livingston explained after the game that going below the belt was an accident and not a dirty play.
