What does a famous married couple do following a break-up? Throw a divorce party.

That is what rocker Jack White and his model-singer-wife Karen Elson announced yesterday on their sixth wedding anniversary, The Associated Press reported. The couple, who have two children together, are divorcing, but invited their family and close friends to celebrate the occasion in Nashville.

"We remain dear and trusted friends and co-parents to our wonderful children Scarlett and Henry Lee,” Elson and White said in a statement released through a publicist. “We feel so fortunate for the time we have shared and the time we will continue to spend both separately and together watching our children grow.”

“In honor of that time shared, we are throwing a divorce party. an evening together in Nashville to re-affirm our friendship and celebrate the past and future with close friends and family."

White is best known as a member of the alt-rock duo The White Stripes with ex-wife Meg White—the group announced its breakup. Elson, released her first album The Ghost Who Walks, last year, which was produced by White.
