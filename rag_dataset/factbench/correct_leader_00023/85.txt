Egypt has begun demolishing the headquarters of the now-dissolved party of former President Hosni Mubarak.

The building in Cairo near Tahrir Square was torched in the 2011 uprising that toppled Mubarak.

Demolition workers also began tearing down a nearby office block that was once the centre of state bureaucracy.

Egypt's government approved the move in April and said that the land would be given to the neighbouring Egyptian Museum.

Mubarak's National Democratic Party (NDP) was dissolved in April 2011 and its assets, including its headquarters on the River Nile, were seized.
