BACK IN 1981, when assassins’ bullets felled Anwar Sadat at a military parade and propelled Hosni Mubarak to Egypt’s highest office, no one dreamed he would fill it for longer than his two predecessors put together. As Sadat’s vice-president, the former air-force commander had kept the low profile of a stolid, trusted retainer. This was not by accident. Mr Mubarak was a military man to the core. To his dying breath he held to the code of silent dutifulness that marks Egypt’s officer class, a praetorian guard that has run the most populous Arab state—with a brief interruption—since seizing power in 1952. In one of his last speeches as president, a week into the 2011 uprising that would soon end his rule, he vowed not to flee into exile as Tunisia’s dictator had done weeks earlier. “Egypt and I shall not be parted until I am buried in her soil,” he said. And so he shall be. Mr Mubarak died in Cairo on February 25th, aged 91.
