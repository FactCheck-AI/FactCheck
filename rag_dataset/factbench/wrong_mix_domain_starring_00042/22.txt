It was only a matter of time before this went to the stage

Hit movie musical La La Land could be heading for Broadway according to the one of the film's producers, Marc Platt.

The Oscar-winning film starred Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling and featured music by Justin Hurwitz and lyrics by Dear Evan Hansen and The Greatest Showman songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul.

According to Deadline, Tony-winning director Bartlett Sher will direct the production with the book being written by Ayad Akhtar and Matthew Decker.

Speaking about the stage adaptation Marc Platt said: “I’m thrilled to reunite with Lionsgate and the incredible team behind La La Land to adapt the movie for the Broadway stage, the next exciting chapter in its evolution.”

“We’ve assembled a world-class team to create a musical that will delight La La Land’s millions of current fans and introduce the property to a whole new audience.”

Jenefer Brown, Lionsgate EVP & Head of Global Products & Experiences said: “With La La Land in Concert marking its sixth year of touring worldwide and the original film a timeless and globally revered cultural touchstone, we’re excited to provide fans yet another way to experience the original movie.”

It's still early days for the production so we'll have to wait and see when this stage adaptation will arrive on Broadway and fingers crossed it will eventually make its way across the pond!
