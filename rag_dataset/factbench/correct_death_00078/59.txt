Sir John A. Macdonald était un avocat, homme d’affaires et homme politique; né le 10 janvier 1815 (date du registre) ou le 11 janvier (date que lui-même et sa famille célébraient) à Glasgow, Écosse, fils de Hugh MacDonald et Helen Shaw; le 1er septembre 1843, il épousa à Kingston, Haut-Canada, Isabella Clark, et ils eurent deux fils, puis le 16 février 1867 à Londres Susan Agnes Bernard, et de ce mariage naquit une fille ; décédé le 6 juin 1891 à Ottawa. [2]

He was the son of Hugh Mcdonald and Helen Shaw.[3]

His parents emigrated to Kingston, Upper Canada (Ontario), in 1820. He attended a local grammar school followed by a private school and at the age of 15 began his training to become a lawyer. In 1835 he opened his own firm in Kingston, which specialized in corporate law by the end of the decade. His career from that point forward combined law with business interests, primarily land development and speculation.

In 1843 he married his cousin, Isabella Clark. The marriage ceremony took place at the family home of his cousin John Alexander Macpherson and cousin and sister-in-law, Maria Sophia Clark in Hallowell (now Picton) Prince Edward County, Canada West. The Rev. Mr. Macrae of St. Andrew’s Church, Kingston officiated.[4] They had two children: John Alexander, who died as an infant, and Hugh John, who survived. Isabella, however, died in 1857 after having suffered from a chronic illness for most of their marriage.

He began his political career as an alderman on Kingston Town Council. After three years as a municipal politician, he was elected to the provincial Legislative Assembly. He was re-elected from Kingston in seven consecutive elections for the assembly between 1844 and 1867 and in three for the federal house between 1867 and 1874.

In 1867 he married Susan Agnes Bernard. [5] [6]They had one daughter, Margaret.[7]

He died in 1891 and was buried at Cataraqui Cemetery, Kingston, Ontario.[8][9]
