Do you devote a significant amount of time charting kicks? It is a lengthy process transferring data like distance, location, operation time and kick result from paper to spreadsheets. That’s why the Simple Kicking field goal tracking iPhone & iPad app was created.

If you are a coach, every few years you are looking for a specialist. The current process involves social media like Twitter and Instagram and/or exchanging videos over iMessage or Text. Other online video services like YouTube are helpful too. Putting it all together you see or hear about punters and kickers through the camps, combines, and showcases. Then you likely send a Twitter DM to gauge if the interest is mutual. If it is, you send them invitations to your camp on campus.

But there is a gap, are you recruiting the kicker or punter based on their highlights on social media, or from games in season?

If you are a high school kicker or punter you might have heard the terms like scholarship and rankings in the same context as recruiting. The timeline typically goes slower than you anticipated, but you go with what you have heard of in the past from peers by attending various showcases and camps.

A college coach has access to your video and charts of your kicks on the Simple Kicking App, a service for Football. To confirm approval, NCAA compliance officers and coaches may find this service on the list of approvals.

How Does the App Work?

Simple Kicking exists to help placekickers make more kicks.

The App captures data so that you can learn about your kicking habits. Why is this important? Mainly, because many Kickers do not employ a full-time kicking coach. Left to their own devices, it is difficult to diagnose problems. Showing statistics, smart graphs, and spray charts, the App helps a Kicker identify problems quickly, saving crucial time. In other words the field goal tracker increases the development timing which means a kicker can improve field goal accuracy quicker, thus reaching potential quicker. The Simple Kicking app is like having a full-time kicking / punting Coach for less than the cost of an iPhone.

For punting, the app helps punters punt to their target.

Punting data is complex because there are many items to chart. In fact, a punt takes around 2 seconds from catch to punt, and another 4 seconds or so for the ball to land. Whereas, it might take some coaches a full 60 seconds to input the relevant data they would like to analyze. As a result, many coaches find it difficult to chart punts, and many punters do not chart their own. That’s why we created the punting tracking feature. Punters have told us that the app helps them identify their tendencies in directional punting. Why does that matter? Most punts are expected to be placed between the numbers and the sideline, around 40 yards or more from the line of scrimmage. The punt tracer, gives immediate feedback allowing punters and coaches to make adjustments. What we’ve seen is more punts landing closer to the intended targets. A repetition from above, the punt tracker or punt tracer is helpful in showing statistics, smart graphs, and spray charts. Simply put the App helps a Punter identify problems quickly, and who knows may become the next Ray Guy Award Winner?

If there are more graphs, doesn’t that make it more technical?

No, the App gives you simplified field goal tracker, punting tracker, or long snapping tracker, displaying information immediately. Identifying key areas of improvement, the App advances a Specialist’s (Kicker, Punter or Long Snapper) development because now he knows more about his habits. In other words, there is instant feedback on where the ball was kicked from to where it crossed the field goal posts or landed on the field. Many data points are captured. Such as the kick’s height and distance, location on field, operation time, and weather; temperature, wind speed & direction. For punting it measures the operation time (op time) catch to kick, hand to foot, hang time, distance, direction, and result.

The App has a place for Parents & Coaches to review the Specialist’s data in the Coaching Dashboard. Rather than the data living inside the Specialist’s head, Coaches & Parents are encouraged to review the information, participating in the Specialist’s development. Having additional support from Parents, Coaches, and the App, Specialist’s feel more fortified and reinforced in their practice.

How does the App help me get more exposure for a potential college scholarship?

Coaches will find the talent, as long as it is developing. Specialists who use the App might be improving and Coaches are watching. The App connects Coaches and Specialists together in an easy system.
