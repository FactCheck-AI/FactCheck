Dame Elizabeth Taylor has been buried in a cemetery just outside Los Angeles, a day after her death.

Her private funeral was held at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

Pop icon Michael Jackson, a friend of Taylor's, is one of a number of stars also buried at the cemetery.

Taylor, one of the 20th Century's biggest movie stars, died in Los Angeles on Wednesday of congestive heart failure. She was 79.

Her funeral service started 15 minutes late, at the star's request.

"Miss Taylor had left instructions that it was to begin at least 15 minutes later than publicly scheduled, with the announcement: 'She even wanted to be late for her own funeral'," said a statement from her publicist.
