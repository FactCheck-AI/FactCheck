Hollywood acting legend Elizabeth Taylor was given a small, private funeral Thursday at Forest Lawn cemetery outside Los Angeles, the same cemetery where her good friend, entertainer Michael Jackson was buried.

Taylor's family and close friends attended the hour-long service that started 15 minutes later than planned, at Taylor's request. A spokeswoman said in a statement Taylor wanted the service to include the announcement - "She even wanted to be late for her own funeral."

Actor Colin Farrell read a poem at the service and Taylor's grandson, Rhys Tivey, performed a trumpet solo of "Amazing Grace."

Forest Lawn is the burial place of many Hollywood celebrities, including Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, and Walt Disney.

Taylor died Wednesday in Los Angeles of congestive heart failure. She had been in the hospital for six weeks. The 79-year-old actress had suffered from a number of medical conditions over the years.

Taylor won two best actress Academy Awards for her performances in Butterfield 8 in 1960 and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf in 1966.
