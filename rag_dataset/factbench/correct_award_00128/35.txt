Profession: Writer

Biography: Andr√© Gide was a French author best known for winning the 1947 Nobel Prize in Literature "for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight."

His works tended to be concerned with the relationship between an individual and the society in which they lived, particularly the difficulty if not impossibility of reconciliation in the contradictions between these aspects.

This theme followed naturally from Gide's self-declared pederasty.
