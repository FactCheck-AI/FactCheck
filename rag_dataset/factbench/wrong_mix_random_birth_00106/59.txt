“Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed, is more important than any other one thing." - Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States

Abraham Lincoln was born in a single-room log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm in LaRue County, Kentucky on February 12, 1809. Self-taught and from humble origins, Abraham Lincoln became one of the most revered and uniquely appealing United States Presidents. Known as Honest Abe, the Rail-splitter, and the Great Emancipator, Lincoln was a skilled orator who preserved the Union during the American Civil War and issued the Emancipation Proclamation. His assassination in 1865 contributed to Lincoln’s legendary place in American history and culture.
