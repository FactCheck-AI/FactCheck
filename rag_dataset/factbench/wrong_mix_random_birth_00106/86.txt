Presidents Day, the holiday celebrating the birthdays of presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, is on Monday, Feb. 19 this year.

Neither president was born on the 19th; Washington was born on Feb. 22, 1732, and Lincoln was born Feb. 12, 1809. But in honor of the men, Presidents Day is celebrated on the third Monday of February.
