CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€” Stephen Jackson had 23 points, Gerald Wallace finished with 20 and the Charlotte Bobcats held off Denver 100-98 on Tuesday night to deny Nuggets coach George Karl his 1,000th NBA win.

Returning to North Carolina where he played in college and going up against his longtime friend and fellow former Tar Heel Larry Brown, Karl had hoped to become the seventh coach in the 1,000-win club in Charlotte.

The Nuggets nearly rallied from eight points down with 90 seconds left, but Chauncey Billups missed a tying jumper in the corner as time expired.

Billups scored 25 points and Carmelo Anthony added 22 points and seven rebounds for the Nuggets, who had won seven straight.

Jackson and Wallace also had nine rebounds apiece.
