AUBURN HILLS, Michigan -- The Detroit Pistons, a model of NBA consistency in recent years, shook things up in a major way Monday, sending All-Star point guard and former NBA finals MVP Chauncey Billups and top reserve Antonio McDyess to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for one-time league MVP Allen Iverson.

The blockbuster deal comes two games into the season for Detroit, which was determined to shake up its core following a third straight exit from the Eastern Conference finals last summer.

The move was confirmed by a basketball official, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the trade had not been announced.

Pistons spokesman Kevin Grigg declined to comment, and messages were left for a Nuggets spokesman as well as for an agent representing Billups and McDyess.

The Pistons were scheduled to play at Charlotte Monday night.

The Bobcats are coached by Larry Brown, who led Billups and the Pistons to the 2004 NBA title and also guided the Iverson-led Philadelphia 76ers to a spot in the finals in 2001.

The move allows Billups to move home.

He was born in Denver and played his college ball at Colorado.

McDyess also will be enjoying a homecoming of sorts, having been a Nugget from 1995-1997 and 1998-2002.
