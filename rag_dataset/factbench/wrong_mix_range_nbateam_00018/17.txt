On June 25, 1997, former Colorado Buffaloes guard Chauncey Billups was drafted with the No. 3 overall pick in the NBA draft by the Boston Celtics at the Charlotte Coliseum in Charlotte, N.C.

If Wake Forest’s Tim Duncan and Utah’s Keith Van Horn, the No. 1 and 2 picks respectively, had elected to forgo their senior seasons in 1996, Billups could quite possibly have been the top overall pick in the draft.

He was already a legend in Colorado basketball. As a high school student at George Washington, the King of Park Hill was named Mr. Basketball three straight years (it would’ve been four, but there was no award his freshman year). In college, he led the Buffaloes to the NCAA Tournament, carrying CU to its first appearance and win in decades.

However, Billups’ tenure with coach Rick Pitino and the Celtics was short-lived. Billups averaged 11.1 points and 4.3 assists in 51 games (44 starts) for Boston. He was traded as part of a seven-player deal to Toronto in February 1998.

He made stops in Denver and Minnesota, before truly finding his all-star level of play with Detroit and later in his second run with the Nuggets.
