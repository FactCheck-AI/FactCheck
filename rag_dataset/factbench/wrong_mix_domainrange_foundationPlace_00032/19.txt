Pastors Galen & Kay Woodward

APOSTOLIC OVERSIGHT PASTORS

Pastors Galen and Kay Woodward moved to Albuquerque in 1981 to become Youth Pastors at what was then First Family Church. After 12 years of leading in that capacity, they were named the new Lead Pastors, bringing with them a fresh vision that would serve not only the Church, but the surrounding communities and the world for the next 28 years. After more than four decades in ministry, Pastors Galen and Kay transitioned their role as Lead Pastors, of what is now Citizen Church, to their oldest son Dustin and his wife, Mandy.
