About

Pay a visit to the small, terraced house where, in 1812, the famous novelist Charles Dickens was born. The home in which he lived for a short time has been lovingly restored and furnished to illustrate middle-class tastes of Dickens' era.

The furniture, ceramics, glass, household objects and decorations faithfully recreate the Regency style which Charles's parents would have favoured, although their actual possessions have long since been dispersed.

There are three furnished rooms: the parlour, the dining room, and the bedroom where Charles was born. The exhibition room features a display on Charles Dickens and Portsmouth, as well as a small collection of memorabilia. This includes the couch on which he died at his house in Kent, his snuff box, inkwell, and paper knife - poignant reminders of an author celebrated for his prodigious talents and creative output.
