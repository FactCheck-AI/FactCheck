Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken on December 12, 1915, in what was called a “cold-water flat” — an apartment with no running hot water.

Francis Albert Sinatra was baptized at this Church at 308 Jefferson Street on April 2, 1916.

Frank Sinatra used to drop by this Italian restaurant at 200 Grand Street after a performance.

They moved to 703 Park Avenue, in a more prestigious area of Hoboken, in 1927, when Frank was 11.
