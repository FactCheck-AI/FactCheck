Frank Sinatra (Francis Albert Sinatra) was born, the son of Italian immigrants Natalie Della (n√©e Garaventi) and Anthony Martin Sinatra, at 415 Monroe Street on December 12, 1915. The site is now an empty lot used for storage as the original tenement building burned down in the 1970s. This marker was erected by the City of Hoboken in 1996.
