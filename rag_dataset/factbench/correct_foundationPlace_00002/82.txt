During World War II, 114 men and one woman from IBM made the supreme sacrifice in the service of their country. â€‹The image below links to the book handed out at the dedication in Endicott, New York on August 16, 1947 remembering fifty-seven who died from this site.

Our thanks to those IBMers that served during World War II but especially to the families that made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. The following is an excerpt from Watson Sr.'s words that day in 1947. The link to a similar book issued during the Poughkeepsie ceremony is here [Poughkeepsie Memorial Day: September 27, 1947]

"We express . . . sympathy, good wishes and appreciation to all of the Gold Star families in IBM and elsewhere. . . What the service men and women from IBM and from every family throughout the United States have done will carry on forever in the minds of all of us in this institution. . . . Without the Armed Forces of the United States the war would have not been won. Let us never forget our obligation, first to the ones who made the supreme sacrifice, secondly to all of the living veterans who were out there willing to do a job, and finally to all the people on the home front who did their best.
