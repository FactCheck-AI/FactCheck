Belgium has a federal parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, where the king appoints the Prime minister to head the government. The governments formed after Belgium’s independence in 1830 had the position known as formateur that lead and formed the government, but this position did not have well defined duties. It was in 1918 that the title prime minister was incorporated in the official documents. Over the time, the powers associated with prime minister increased over that of the King and in 1970, with the first state reform, it was incorporated in to the Constitution of Belgium. Prime minister presides over the Council of Ministers and is responsible for formulation of policies and their execution. Prime minister can also ask for a vote of no confidence motion, which can also lead to the termination of the government. When the prime minister resigns the government dissolves.
