A novelist and critic who taught literature and creative writing at the University of Massachusetts and Temple University, Samuel R. Delany is the winner of four Nebula Awards and two Hugo Awards. He was inducted into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2002, by which time he’d also been chosen by the Lambda Literary Report as one of the 50 people who had done the most to change our view of gayness in the last half-century. In 2013, he was named the 31st Damon Knight Memorial Foundation Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. Delany’s science fiction novels include the Nebula-Award winning Babel-17 and The Einstein Intersection, as well as Nova and Dhalgren. He is also the author of the widely taught Times Square Red / Times Square Blue and a book-length autobiographical essay, The Motion of Light in Water, which won a Hugo Award in 1989. He retired from teaching at the end of 2015 and lives in Philadelphia with his partner, Dennis Rickett.
