Older brother of George Gershwin. In 1924 they worked together on "Lady, Be Good!", a success on Broadway. They wrote the music for many shows and four movies. When George died of a brain tumour in 1937 Ira paused three years before he continued writing.

He worked with others like Jerome Kern, Kurt Weil and Harold Arlen. After "Park Avenue" failed in 1946 he stopped writing for Broadway productions. He was nominated for an Academy Award for best song several times, but he never won.

When he died in 1983 in Beverly Hills he had been married 56 years to his wife Leonore. He was buried in the mausoleum of his brother in Hastings-on-Hudson near New York City.
