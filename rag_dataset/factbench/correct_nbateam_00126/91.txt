The Atlanta Hawks will be without their best big man Friday night but will get two players back to add to the rotation. The team announced earlier this afternoon that Zaza Pachulia will sit out tonight's game with a sore Achilles but both Marvin Williams and Ivan Johnson will return to action.

Pachulia has helped pick up the slack after Al Horford was lost for the season and has played heavy minutes of late. After 48 minutes against the Cavaliers on Wednesday and with the Hawks set to begin a three games in three days stretch it is probably a good idea to give Zaza a little time to recover.

Marvin Williams has missed the last five games with a hip injury that he suffered in Denver against the Nuggets. Ivan Johnson missed Wednesday's game against the Cavs but is back for tonight's game.
