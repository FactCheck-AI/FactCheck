Charlotte Hornets’ forward Marvin Williams chose Tuesday to exercise his player option to remain with the team for the 2019-20 season, a deal that will pay the former Tar Heel $15,006,250 before he hits unrestricted free agency the following offseason.

ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski was the first to report the news.

Williams, who helped UNC win the 2005 national championship in his only year of college ball, averaged 10.1 PPG, 5.4 RPG, and 1.2 APG for the Hornets last season–all while serving as a great source of veteran leadership in the locker room.

The former second overall pick in 2005 by the Atlanta Hawks will be 33 years old next season, but still provides value on the court with his defensive versatility and ability to knock down three-pointers at a solid percentage.
