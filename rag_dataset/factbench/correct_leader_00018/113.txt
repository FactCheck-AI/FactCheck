Topline: Jacques Chirac, one of France’s longest-serving presidents, who was later beset by corruption scandals, died on Thursday at age 86, his family confirmed.

Chirac had been experiencing memory loss for years after suffering a stroke while in office. His cause of death has not been revealed.

The, charismatic, center-right politician became known as one of France’s, and Europe’s, longest-serving leaders, serving as president from 1995 to 2007, in addition to two terms as prime minister and an 18-year stint as Paris mayor.

He led major political reforms including overseeing France’s adoption of the euro currency and shortening presidential terms to five years from seven. Chirac was widely praised for France’s strong opposition to the US-led invasion into Iraq in 2003, and he acknowledged his country's role in the Holocaust.

But in 2011 he became the first French president to be convicted of corruption. He was given a two-year suspended sentence after being found guilty of illegally funneling public funds to finance his party during his time as mayor.

The French National Assembly held a minute’s silence to mark his death.

Crucial quote: "Europe is not only losing a great statesman, but the president is losing a great friend," said Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.

Tangent: A key test for Chirac’s presidency was holding a referendum on France’s role in the European Union. Voters rejected the new proposed EU constitution with a 55% majority, leading to the amended Treaty of Lisbon. Nicolas Sarkozy would be reappointed as French interior minister in the political shakeup and would go on to succeed Chirac as president.
