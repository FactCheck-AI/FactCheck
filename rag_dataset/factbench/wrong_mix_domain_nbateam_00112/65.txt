Former NBA big man Kwame Brown is back in the news after he went off on Los Angeles Lakers superstar small forward LeBron James during a recent IG Live session.

Brown called James a “stat sheet junkie” and ripped the future Hall of Famer for getting swept by the Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference Finals.

“If I had a LeBron James jersey, I’d be burning it right now,” Brown said. “If I had a LeBron James jersey, it would be on fire right now. … I must say, the bust is upset. … I discovered, LeBron, you not that bruh. I’m sorry. I can’t hate to say it. You’re a stat sheet junkie. You a bad boy when it comes to stats. Throughout history, the little nerds are gonna look up your stat line and they gonna say, ‘He’s gotta be the greatest player to ever play the game.’ And people who actually play are gonna know that is bulls**t.”

James had 40 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in Game 4. However, he couldn’t get a shot off at the end of regulation with the Lakers down by two points, as Nuggets stars Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic played tough defense on him.

Brown was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 draft. He’s considered one of the biggest busts in NBA history. The South Carolina native only averaged 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds in 607 games with the Washington Wizards, Lakers, Memphis Grizzlies, Detroit Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Golden State Warriors, and Philadelphia 76ers.

James, 38, led the Lakers to the conference finals after the team began the season 2-10. However, Jokic, Murray, and the Nuggets were too much for The King, who has a torn tendon in his right foot. LeBron may need surgery this summer and the NBA’s all-time leading scorer could retire from basketball.
