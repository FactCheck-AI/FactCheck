Coltrane was born in Hamlet, North Carolina, but moved to a home on Underhill Street in High Point when he was only 3 months old.

Organizers said the goal is to turn the home into a facility for people to visit in the community.

âI do believe that this could be a catalyst to revitalize this area,â said Phyllis Bridges, historian and vice chair of High Point Preservation Society. "This is a historic African-American district. So, I think this house would be the key to getting things started.â

The home needs work on the ceiling, floors, and new paint.
