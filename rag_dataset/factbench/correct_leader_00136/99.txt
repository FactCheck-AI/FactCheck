Botha House was opened in January 1923, and was named after Louis Botha, the first Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa. Situated close to lecture halls, a world class library and sports facilities, Botha House provides an ideal environment for academic study and personal growth. The men of Botha House have traditionally involved themselves fully in University life, mostly through involvement in leadership and sporting endeavours. The residence has a wonderful sense of community, where mutual respect for each other allows for the development of life long friendships and provides an excellent foundation from which to experience a full Rhodes University education.
