It's official: Mila Kunis is now Mrs Ashton Kutcher.

People magazine confirmed that the couple, who welcomed their first daughter Wyatt late last year, tied the knot at a private ceremony over the weekend.

The pair begun dating in 2012 following the breakdown of Kutcher's first marriage to actress Demi Moore. They had been friends for over a decade after finding fame together on cult TV series That 70s Show in the early 2000s.
