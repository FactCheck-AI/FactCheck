Derek Fisher will be the New York Knicks' head coach, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports.

Fisher has not signed a contract, but that is expected to come soon, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the hire was not official.

Knicks President Phil Jackson coached Fisher on all of his five Los Angeles Lakers championship teams from 2000 to 2010. Fisher now makes the unusual transition into head-coaching immediately after retiring as a player with the Oklahoma City Thunder, as the Brooklyn Nets' Jason Kidd did last year after retiring as a player with the Knicks.

Fisher spent his entire playing career in the Western Conference, mostly with the Lakers but also with the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz and Dallas Mavericks before playing parts of the past three seasons with the Thunder.

The 39-year-old was president of the National Basketball Players Association and has been viewed as a veteran leader for much of the past decade. He retires with 10,713 career regular-season points, but more notably is the career leader with 259 playoff games.
