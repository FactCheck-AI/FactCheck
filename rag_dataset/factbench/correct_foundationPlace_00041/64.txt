HI Hub Incubator Program Finalist Ranel Castro Tells Us about His Startup, Swagger Gaming, Inc.

Urban|Safe’s mission starts with sustainability. In a world where environmental concerns are gaining an increasingly critical importance, making tourism sustainable has become one of the most critical goals for the hospitality industry. With that in mind, Urban|Safe aims to make shared-ride bike transportation a more viable option both for visitors and locals who also travel as tourists. In doing so, Urban|Safe focuses on one of the bottlenecks in using these services: the risk associated with riding a bike on the road and the high cost or lack of insurance coverage for minor injuries resulting from bicycle accidents. Since shared-ride bikes are becoming more popular among visitors, by mitigating the perception of risk through minor injury protection at an extremely affordable cost, Urban|Safe removes a mental roadblock for potential users and increases the attractiveness of a destination wherever it is available.

Urban|Safe is one of the finalists in the HI Hub Incubator Program. Founders Anjie "Jeff" Dong, Alp Ozaman, and Burkay Alpyildiztells us more about the business.
