The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation is a private family foundation dedicated to transforming the lives of children living in urban poverty through better health and education. Pragmatic, disciplined and innovative in our approach and global in our perspective, the foundation seeks to concentrate resources where there is opportunity to achieve direct, measurable, replicable and lasting systemic changes that improve a significant numbers of lives. We are endowed with $1.3 billion and distribute approximately $100 million annually with current work, primarily in the United States and India, focused in three areas: Urban Education, Childhood Health, and Family Economic Stability. Additionally, we feel a special responsibility to the underserved in our home state and support statewide initiatives and non-profit programs addressing Education, Childhood Health & Fitness and Childhood Safety issues in Central Texas. The foundation has its headquarters in Austin, Texas and a liaison office in Delhi, India.
