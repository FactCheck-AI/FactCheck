The Portland Trail Blazers were a 1970 NBA expansion team and have been playing in the Western Conference Northwest Division since. After the Vancouver Grizzlies moved to Memphis and the Seattle Supersonics moved to Oklahoma City, the Trail Blazers are the only remaining team in the Pacific Northwest. Upon their inception, the officials held a name-the-team contest. Pioneers was actually the most popular name, but since the Lewis and Clark College was nearby, the officials chose the Trail Blazers instead.

The Trail Blazers have won one NBA Champion in 1977, and the team remained popular and sold out a record breaking 814 consecutive home games in the 90s. The Trail Blazer’s logo is a pinwheel, that was created as an interpretation of two five-on-five basketball teams lined up. The pinwheel was originally vertical but has since been rotated.

The Trail Blazers mascot is Blaze the Trail Cat, a silver colored mountain lion, and has represented the team since 2002. The team officials registered him for a trademark in 2004. However, before Blaze, the team’s unofficial mascot who was Bill “the Beerman” Scott, a Seattle Beer Vendor who worked in the arena for only 4 years.

In addition to their logo and mascot, the Trail Blazers have taken great care to protect their brand. The nickname “Rip City” has been registered as a trademark since 2009. The phrase has been protected for different classes throughout the years – it was registered in 2018 for toys and sporting equipment and in 2020 for clothing; the phrase is still pending for both beer – filed in 2019 – and trading cards – filed in 2017.

Other popular phrases include Blazermania – filed for a trademark for clothing in 2019 – to represent the fan base of the Trail Blazers. Also, the team has its own beer branding, and registered “Reigning 3’s” in 2019.
