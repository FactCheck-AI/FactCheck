UNICOM® Systems, Inc. has announced the release of Focal Point™ version 7.5.1. Focal Point is a comprehensive portfolio planning solution that market-driven teams can use to make collaborative, objective decisions to deliver products, projects and services, offering the highest customer and business value.
