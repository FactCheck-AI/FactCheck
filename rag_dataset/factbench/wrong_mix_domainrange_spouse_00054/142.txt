Why did Michelle McGee carry on an 11-month affair with Sandra Bullock's husband Jesse James?

"Boredom," McGee claimed Wednesday on Howard Stern's Sirius XM radio show. "Had nothing better to do."

"It was a sexual thing," the tattooed model and stripper explained. "I also wished it was a relationship — but I wasn't in love with him."

After James sent McGee a message on MySpace, the pair hooked up – and watched TV — in the office of his motorcycle shop. The illicit lovers had sex "two to three, four times a night, two times a week," often on James' coffin-shaped couch, she told an incredulous Stern. McGee "never saw" the Seal Beach, Calif. home James shared with Bullock, his wife of nearly five years.

McGee wouldn't confirm whether James wore a condom during their trysts. "That's just too personal," she explained to Stern. "I was on birth control pills, so I wasn't afraid of getting pregnant."

Did Bullock over come up in conversation? "We watched her on TV one time," she said. "[James] said they were separated, so I believed him."

McGee yearned to do more than just have sex with James in his office. "I was like, 'Let's go do something! Let's go get food!'

James' retort: "He was always like 'Shh!..Can't go out in public, just be patient, just give it time, stuff like that.'"

Still, she never expected marriage from James. "I couldn't even get him to take me out for pizza! Of course he wasn't gonna marry me."

Bullock's husband wasn't exactly lavish with gifts to his mistress, either. "He gave me a t-shirt once…it had wolves on it."

Bullock filed for divorce late last month; she recently revealed that she has secretly adopted a baby boy, Louis Bardo, from New Orleans, in January.

"I feel bad for her," McGee says of Bullock. "I do."
