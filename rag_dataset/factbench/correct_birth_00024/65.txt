A public park dedicated to Jimi Hendrix is set to be constructed in Seattle.

The legendary guitarist was born in Seattle in 1942, spending most of his early life in the city. Now, Hendrix will be honoured with the Jimi Hendrix Park later this year.

As Rolling Stone report, construction will be begin next month (April) with completion expected in the autumn. The park will incorporate a “chronological timeline of Jimi’s life and career”.

Janie Hendrix, sister of Jimi, says of the news: “The Jimi Hendrix Park is the culmination of years of hard work, collaboration, creative input, and generosity invested in something we all believed in and constructed to commemorate an amazing human being. It is our hope that for generations, it will exist as more than an attraction or point of interest, but a place of homage to one of Seattle’s own. The landscaping, the artistic design, and the ambience all mimic the vibe of the persona of Jimi, whom this park honors.”

Meanwhile, All Is By My Side, a British-Irish film about the life of Jimi Hendrix, starring OutKast’s Andre 3000, was released in the UK last summer.

Andre 3000 – real name André Benjamin – revealed that he had concerns that he was ‘too old’ to play Hendrix. He said: “I didn’t know if I was too old to play the part. But John [Ridley, writer/director] was really persistent, and he kept at it. So I just kind of said, ‘All right, let’s do it.'”
