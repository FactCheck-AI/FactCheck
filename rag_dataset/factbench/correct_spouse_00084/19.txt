Rio de Janeiro - Milan's Brazilian striker Alexandre Pato is set to marry his compatriot Sthefany Brito, an actress, July 7, in a ceremony at the traditional Copacabana Palace hotel in Rio de Janeiro.

Pato, set to turn 20 in September, has been dating Brito since late 2007.

The bride's mother, Sandra Brito, told Brazilian news website G1 Wednesday that the ceremony will be small.

"Only the closest friends will be present," she said.

She added that her daughter is set to travel to Italy Thursday to meet her fiance, but probably also to choose a wedding gown by one of the world-famous Italian designers.

Pato has to return to Brazil by late Monday, to prepare with the national team the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Uruguay and Paraguay, and for the Confederations Cup. Should Brazil reach the final of the Confederations Cup, the young striker would have only a week to finalize the details of his wedding.(dpa)
