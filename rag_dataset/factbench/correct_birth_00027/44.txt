Milos Raonic tells Tennis Canada that he and his Davis Cup teammates will feel at home when they travel to Serbia for the semifinals. Raonic is originally from Montenegro, Frank Dancevic has a Serbian father, and Daniel Nestor was born in Belgrade. Raonic and Dancevic are said to be fluent Serbo-Croatian speakers.

âStuff is going to be easy there, itâs not like weâre going to South America and nobody speaks Spanish,â Raonic said. âI think itâs going to be a comfortable situation for us â but obviously not too comfortable. And I think there will be, for that reason, a bit more support than you would imagine for us. I look forward to playing there.â
