He is famous for his comic masterpieces Lady Windermere's Fan and The Importance of Being Earnest, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray (Wilde's only novel), his long poem The Ballad of Reading Gaol and, of course, his humorous, witty one-line quotations.

Wilde is regarded as one of the most proficient and versatile writers of the English language.

"All that I desire to point out is the general principle that life imitates art far more than art imitates life."
