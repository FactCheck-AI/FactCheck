In the first two Predator movies the Predator was played by the brilliant Kevin Peter Hall.

Standing at a towering 7’2” he replaced Jean-Claude Van Damme as the title creature when it became clear that things weren’t working out for various reasons (see my Film Fact #3).

Hall, a former basketball player pursued a career in acting and due to his size ended up playing two of the “biggest” creatures of the 1980s: The Predator in Predator (1987) and Predator 2 (1990), and “Harry” (Bigfoot) in Harry and the Henderson’s (1987) and also the tv show of the same name.

Unfortunately some time between 1990 and 1991 Hall was involved in a major car accident and during surgery was given contaminated blood in a transfusion. He contracted HIV and shortly after was diagnosed with AIDS. He sadly died of AIDS related pneumonia on 10th April 1991, a month short of his 36th birthday.

He gave us one of the best sci-fi movie creatures of all time! 👌

If you get a few minutes, this video about him that also features some behind the scenes footage of Predator is worth a watch. 👇
