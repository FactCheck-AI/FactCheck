Basketball Strong Podcast co-host Tim DiFrancesco (TD) started his pro basketball career with the Bakersfield Jam in the NBA D-League. He was then recruited to become the strength and conditioning coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, where he spent six seasons, including Kobe Bryant’s final four years in the league.

Even when the ink is dry on someone’s new contract, they don’t become a true part of their new team until the players fully embrace them. In this episode, TD tells the hilarious story of how this happened with the Lakers squad before a game with their arch-rivals, the Boston Celtics.
