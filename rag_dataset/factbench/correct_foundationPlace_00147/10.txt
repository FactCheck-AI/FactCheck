Context

The Awesome Foundation is a worldwide network of local chapters. Each month or bi-monthly, people can pitch their Awesome ideas to the micro-trustees on a local level. They judge the ideas and choose the best one. The best idea is then granted â¬1000 to implement the idea. The foundation started in 2008 in Boston and can be found in 82 cities all over the world.

Challenges, Opportunities and Transferability

The Awesome foundation thrives on the help of the volunteers, the micro-trustees. They contribute in time and money to make the Awesome ideas possible. This bottom-up approach only works if the group of volunteers is dedicated to the cause of the foundation.
