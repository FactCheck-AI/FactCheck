The reboot of fantasy movie Jumanji has given the first glimpse of Nick Jonas‘ character on the film’s set.

Jonas had been rumoured to appear in the new version of the 1995 film, which starred Robin Williams as a man who became trapped in a board game he played as a child 26 years ago. When he’s released, so too are magical beasts from the board game.

The new version sees the board game reimagined as a video game. The Rock stars as one of the gamers’ avatar, Dr Smolder Bravestone. In a photo on Instagram, The Rock shared a photo of him with Jonas seemingly in costume as another as-yet-unnamed avatar.

The Rock wrote: “Officially welcoming my guy Nick Jonas to Jumanji. Great dude, great positive energy, very talented. He’s going to kill this role like I kill things with my bare hands. The jungle awaits, the adventure continues. And ironically, the one who sings most on set is Jack Black.”

Other actors to play avatars in the reboot, due in cinemas in July 2017, include former Dr Who actress Karen Gillan as Ruby Roundhouse and Kevin Hart as Moose Phinbar. Hart was today named as the highest-paid stand-up comedian in the world by Forbes, having amassed £67.2m for his stand-up from June 2015-June 2016.

Bad Teacher director Jake Kasdan is making the reboot, while the original was directed by Honey I Shrunk The Kids filmmaker Joe Johnston.

Having voiced the cherub in Night Of The Museum sequel Battle Of The Smithsonian in 2009, Jonas has recently begun making inroads into regular acting. As well as Jumanji, Jonas has roles in Careful What You Wish For and Goat.
