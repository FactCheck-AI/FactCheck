IT is announced that the 1934 Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology has been awarded jointly to Dr. George F. Minot and Dr. William T. Murphy, of Boston, Massachusetts, and Dr. George H. Whipple, of Rochester, New York State, for their research into liver therapeutics in connexion with anaemia (Times Oct. 26). Dr. Minot is professor of medicine at Harvard University and Dr. Whipple is dean and professor of pathology of the University of Rochester, New York. The liver treatment of pernicious or Addisonian anaemia, which is now the standard treatment for the disease, was developed by Minot and Murphy about eight years ago from the experi mental work of Whipple and his associates on secondary anaemia in dogs. Whipple maintained his animals in an anaemic condition by frequent with drawals of blood, and tested the power of different foodstuffs to cause blood regeneration by adding definite amounts to a standard diet on which re generation did not occur. Among the substances so tested was liver. Minot and Murphy tried it in pernicious anaemia and found that adequate amounts produced a remission which is maintained provided the treatment is continued. Liver has little or no action in human secondary anaemias, but is effective in certain other anaemias which, like pernicious anaemia, are characterised by an increase in the amount of haemoglobin in each red blood cell although the total amount per unit volume of blood is diminished.
