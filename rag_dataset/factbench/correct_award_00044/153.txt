Nobel Prize Medal, Cash and Philanthropy

Dr. George H. Whipple shared his Nobel Prize money with the woman who was his fellow Pathologist and Researcher, Dr. Frieda Robscheit-Robbins. Between 1921 and 1930, they had co-authored 21 papers. They discovered liver therapy for pernicious anaemia, the discovery for which the Nobel Prize was awarded. Source: RocWiki, The People’s Guide to Rochester.
