Mumbai, June 16 (ANI): Workers from a hospital owned and run by Ness Wadia filed a petition againstBollywood actress Preity Zinta at Marine Drive police station here on Monday, saying that she had misused Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The workers launched a signature campaign in support of Wadia. While addressing the media, aWadias supporter said, "The business tycoon and the actress were in a relationship for more than five-years, and they were even business partners, and what the 39-year-old actress had accused him of was completely wrong, as the two were sitting in entirely different rows during the Wankhede IPL match, and therefore, Wadia could not have forced upon her." Another supporter asserted that the law for protecting women is getting diluted because of its misuse, and they were now afraid of being friendly with their female colleagues. Earlier, the Bollywood actress had filed a molestation case against Wadia for use of force and foul language to shame her in public. Zinta also issued a public statement on Facebook regarding the molestation case. (ANI)
