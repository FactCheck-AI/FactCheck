Landscape Architecture & Planting Plan | Cambridge, Massachusetts

Prominently located on a hilltop at the entrance to Mount Auburn Cemetery, Bigelow Chapel has been a key focal point of the cemetery since it was built in 1846. Halvorson provided landscape design services for the critical enhancement of the Chapel’s grounds and entry experience as a necessary component of the Cemetery’s plans to expand and improve funerary and interment options.

Landscape improvements enhance the new accessible entrance to the Chapel and complement the building’s traditional symmetry. Ornamental and evergreen trees filter views of the Asa Gray Garden through the glass curtain wall of the new addition and provide serenity and privacy. Within the interior, Halvorson devised a new courtyard viewing area to provide comfort for people attending services at the chapel.
