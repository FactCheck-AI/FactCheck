Directors, critics and fans worldwide Monday mourned the death of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa as the end of an era in filmmaking and marveled at his enduring impact on the art of cinema.

Kurosawa died of a stroke Sunday at his Tokyo home at age 88, leaving behind a 30-film body of work that put Japanese cinema on the international stage and influenced a generation of directors at home and around the world."We are not going to see that kind of filmmaking again," said Stephen Prince, author of a 1991 book about Kurosawa called "The Warrior's Camera."

Even in Japan, where studios shunned him for decades, officials prepared to honor the director.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters Monday that Kurosawa would be named a winner of the People's Honor Award, a widely respected prize for cultural achievement. Japanese newspapers ran special sections with scenes from his films.

Kurosawa was praised in death for the talents that propelled him to prominence in life: his haunting lyricism, his technical mastery and his brilliant melding of traditional Japanese theatrical forms with epic presentation.

"The term `giant' is used too often to describe artists. But in the case of Akira Kurosawa, we have one of the rare instances where the term fits," said director Martin Scorsese.

Kurosawa garnered three Oscars during his half-century career.
