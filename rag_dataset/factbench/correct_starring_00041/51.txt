JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. – At the Four Seasons resort in the Rockies, not far from Yellowstone National Park, where pivotal events in “2012” take place, the film’s star John Cusack takes his usual wry stance.

Cusack listens as his “2012” writer-director, the disaster epic specialist Roland Emmerich (“Independence Day,” “The Day After Tomorrow”), considers what he will be doing in December 2012.

According to the Mayan prophecies referenced in the movie, that’s when the world will end; the German-born Emmerich plans to ski.

As for Cusack?

“I will try to get on Roland’s train,” he cracked.

In case you missed the action-packed trailers, this doomsday movie depicts California plunging into the ocean, Rome burning, Paris falling, the White House underwater and Cusack dodging fiery volcanic comets to save his two kids.

“I think it taps into the paranoia about how out of control the world feels. Everybody sort of knows what all the problems are, with global warming and all of those things in the zeitgeist. This smartly doesn’t get into the politics of it,” he said.

“It just gets into the fact of what’s important to you, what matters and that feeling you have if something bad happens you try to cut through all the BS.”

For Cusack, “2012” meant “A lot of running, jumping, tumbling. You got to stay stretched-out or you’ll definitely pull a hamstring for sure.”

The actor signed on for “2012” because, “It was nice to be wanted. I read the script and it was a real page-turner and very surprising. By the end it actually got quite emotional and very tense.”

Cusack goes back in time with his upcoming comedy Hot Tub Time Machine. “It’s about four losers who get stuck back in the 1980s,” he said.

Speaking of the ’80s – this year is the 20th anniversary of his 1989 hit “Say Anything.”

“2012” opens Friday.
