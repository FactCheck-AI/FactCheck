John Cusack has admitted that his "street cred" could be at risk as he stars in new Roland Emmerich disaster movie 2012.

However, the Grosse Point Blank actor also told ShortList that he enjoyed the lack of personal pressure with the role.

Cusack said: "I've done a couple of big movies like this here and there, so if you get a good one it's always good to do.

"Doing films like this helps you stay in the movie business, it helps you make the smaller ones."

He added: "I suppose there's a risk to my street cred, being in a movie of this size, sure. But other than that the pressure's off me and on the studio. That's kind of a nice feeling.

"The script is very deftly written. It avoids some of the clichÃ©s that you find in those sorts of movies. It's cleverer. It's still melodrama, sure, but it's done well."
