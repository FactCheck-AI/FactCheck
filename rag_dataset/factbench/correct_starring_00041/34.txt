John Cusack is an amazing actor and lately he has been streaching his legs playing different types of roles than he is used to playing. He was incredible in '1408' and that was a pretty successful film. He has the box office draw when the story is right. I thought he did very well in 'Martian Child' but there was just no audience for that kind of movie. John has what it takes to carry a big movie, he just doesn't do it very often. '2012' is a big budget apocalyptic thiller. From what it sounds like this may be the biggest film John Cusack will star in. I am a big fan of the story and setting of this movie as well. It is based on an actual Mayan Calendar that predicts the end of the world in 2012. Here is the description from Variety:

Story centers on an academic researcher who opens a portal into a parallel universe and makes contact with his double in order to prevent an apocalypse predicted by the ancient Mayans.

"Redbelt" star Chiwetel Ejiofor also is in talks to join the big-budget epic, which chronicles the end days of human civilization.

Studio is keeping logline under wraps, but it is believed to revolve around the upcoming apocalypse predicted by the Mayans.
