I am passionate about the mission of Concordia and my vocation of college professor. I want to teach at a school where I can integrate my Christian worldview into the classroom. Teaching is about passion. You must love what you do, and you must communicate that passion – that excitement – to others. Above all, I teach for the LORD (Colossians 3:23). I am passionate about computer science (methods of problem solving) and cosmogony (science of origins).

As a teacher of writing and literature, I believe that stories and the way we communicate our ideas are essential to who we are as human beings. By studying these concepts, students can understand how they can craft their own words and stories to best effect, but also how the stories and words they hear and read are used to affect them.
