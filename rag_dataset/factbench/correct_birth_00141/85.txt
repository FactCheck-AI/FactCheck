Born March 6th, 1972 in Newark, New Jersey, Shaquille O'Neal spent his youth moving around the world, but wherever he was he always had a basketball in his hands. As a teen in Texas, he set high school records, before enrolling at Louisiana State University to become an even bigger star. He parlayed his NCAA success into an NBA career, and was chosen first by the Orlando Magic in the 1992 Draft.
