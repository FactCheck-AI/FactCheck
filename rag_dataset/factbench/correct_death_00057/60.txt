Charles "Bird" Parker, Jr. (August 29, 1920 - March 12, 1955) was an African-American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker is commonly considered one of the greatest jazz musicians. A founding father of bebop, Parker's innovative approach to melody, rhythm and harmony was enormously influential on his contemporaries. Parker also became an icon for the Beat generation, and was a pivotal figure in the evolving conception of the jazz musician as an uncompromising artist and intellectual, rather than just a popular entertainer. At various times, Parker fused jazz with other musical styles, from classical to Latin music. He died at the age of 34. Though the official cause of death was (lobar) pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, his death was hastened by his drug and alcohol abuse.
