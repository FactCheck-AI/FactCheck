He’s not a three-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner for no reason, and if anyone forgot what a dangerous scorer the Clippers have lurking on the bench, he reminded them with an flurry of buckets.

Jamal Crawford poured in 28 points in 25 minutes to carry his Los Angeles Clippers to a 108-95 win over the Utah Jazz on Saturday. It was Crawford’s highest mark of the season, and he scored 17 of his points in the fourth quarter alone.

The 37-year-old guard did not turn the ball over in his time on the floor and made eight of his 12 shot attempts while drilling all nine of his free throws. Only two players have scored at least 28 points this season as quickly as Crawford did on Saturday: Lou Williams (29 points in 24 minutes vs. SAC) and DeMarcus Cousins (31 points in 21 minutes vs. OKC), according to Basketball-Reference.

Crawford’s most impressive bucket came off of a smooth crossover, behind-the-back move that stuck Jazz guard Rodney Hood.

“He makes it look so easy, so sweet,” DeAndre Jordan said after the game. “It’s like poetry in motion.”

It wasn’t the only time Crawford used a behind-the-back move to score on Saturday. He hit Joe Johnson with a double behind-the-back move on the way to the rack and tortured Hood, who checked the dreaded bench scorer much of the night.

The Clippers are now a half-game behind the Jazz for the fourth seed in the Western Conference. The two teams are a near lock to face each other in the first round of the West playoffs.

If Crawford continues gunning how he did on Saturday, the Jazz will be in trouble in April.
