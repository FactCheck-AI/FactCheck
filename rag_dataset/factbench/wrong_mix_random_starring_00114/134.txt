Kanye West will receive the lifetime achievement award at the MTV Video Music Awards.

The rapper will be honoured for his "ground-breaking videos, legendary performances and continued impact on music, art, fashion and culture."

It's the ceremony's highest honour, known as the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award.

Previous winners include Madonna, Beyonce, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake and The Rolling Stones.

Justin Bieber, Pharrell, Demi Lovato, Macklemore & Ryan Lewis, Tori Kelly, A$AP Rocky and Twenty One Pilots will all perform live at the event.

Kanye caused controversy at the 2009 ceremony when he jumped on stage and interrupted Taylor Swift's speech launching a rant about why his friend Beyonce should have won best female video instead.
