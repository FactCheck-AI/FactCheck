The following is an excerpt from New York: A Guide to the Empire State in the Buffalo points of interest section:

The SITE OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT McKINLEY, in the middle of Fordham Drive between Elmwood Ave. and Lincoln Parkway, is marked by a bronze tablet embedded in a low boulder set in a grass plot. On the afternoon of September 6, 1901, President William McKinley, while visiting the Pan-American Exposition, was receiving the public in the Temple of Music. As he was shaking hands with a line of people, a young man approached with a handkerchief covering the revolver in his hand fired two shots. The President died eight days later in the Milburn home. The assassin, Leon F. Czolgosz, was electrocuted in Auburn prison the following October.

Upon McKinley's death, Theodore Roosevelt took the oath of office at the Wilcox Mansion near downtown Buffalo.
