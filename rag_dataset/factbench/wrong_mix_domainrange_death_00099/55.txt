Kurt Cobain was found dead by suicide inside his Washington home 25 years ago. The Nirvana singer was just 27 and was survived by his wife, Courtney Love, and their baby daughter, Frances Bean. After he passed away, 70,000 fans gathered outside the Seattle Center to pay respects to the man they dubbed “the voice of a generation.” If you or someone you know needs help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
