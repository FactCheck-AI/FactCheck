The Seventh Tower is a series of children’s fantasy novels by Australian novelist Garth Nix. The series was created due to a partnership between Scholastic and LucasFilm. The story focuses on two children from polar opposite societies who must come together to remove a veil that has been blocking the sun off for their entire life, leaving them in total darkness. The two children are 13 year-olds Tal, a Chosen from the Castle, and Milla, an Icecarl from the Ice.

Garth Nix began the Seventh Tower series in 2000 with the novel The Fall. The series lasted six novels, ending in 2001 with The Violet Keystone. Below is a list of Garth Nix’s Seventh Tower books in order of when they were first released (which is the same as their chronological order):
