Honeywell Aerospace Technologies has long been at the forefront of electric propulsion innovation, continuously pushing boundaries in sustainable transportation. Through groundbreaking collaborations with industry leaders like DENSO and visionary projects such as our 1-MW Generator for the Flying Whales airship, Honeywell demonstrates an unwavering commitment to pioneering solutions. Among our most ambitious initiatives is the ARPA-E ASCEND program, a collaborative effort with the University of Maryland aimed at designing, developing, and showcasing a high-power density Advanced Electric Propulsion System (AEPS).

Pioneering Sustainability

Initiatives like ASCEND underscore Honeywell Aerospace Technologies' dedication to advancing electric propulsion and actively contributing to global efforts towards carbon neutrality and sustainable aviation. Our pursuit of excellence is reflected in the integration of cutting-edge technologies like Standard-Edge-Wound (SEW) Windings, High Temp Insulation (HTI), and Air-Cooled Thermal Management Systems (TMS) into our propulsion systems.

Innovative Technology

The ASCEND AEPS program integrates state-of-the-art technologies to boost performance and efficiency for next-generation aircraft. This includes SEW Windings to minimize thermal impedance, HTI to elevate operating temperature capacity, and an Air-Cooled TMS to enhance heat transfer. Furthermore, the incorporation of High Voltage Power Electronics and Composite Material Selections further amplifies power density and efficiency, positioning ASCEND as a trailblazer in electric propulsion technology.

Technological Approach

ASCEND's technological strategy is defined by its innovative design elements to maximize power density and fault tolerance. The electric motor boasts a multi-pole/multi-slot Halbach array, Advanced HTI, and a Composite rotor structure. Meanwhile, the Power Electronics (Motor Drive) leverage high voltage, high-power SiC-based, multi-phase, multi-level inverters with an architecture engineered for corona and partial discharge compliance. The Air-Cooled Thermal Management System utilizes a manifold mini-channel heat exchanger system for optimal cooling.

Strategic Advantages

ASCEND offers strategic benefits that extend beyond individual projects. By championing Sustainability and Electrification Megatrends, ASCEND accelerates carbon neutrality through Zero-E propulsion and unlocks new propulsion segments for commuter and transport aircraft. Moreover, the technology cultivated under ASCEND finds applications across various divisions within Honeywell, fostering synergies across Engines & Power Systems (E&PS) and Advanced Electromechanical Solutions (AES).

Power Requirements and Performance Objectives

ASCEND's power requirements have been selected to meet the evolving demands of the aerospace industry. By anticipating the shift to Distributed Electric Propulsion (DEP), ASCEND Motors hold potential applicability across a broad spectrum of aircraft concepts. Performance targets, including motor peak and continuous power, input voltage, system power density, and motor drive efficiency underscore ASCEND's dedication to delivering high-performance, efficient, and eco-conscious propulsion solutions.

In summary, the ASCEND program marks a significant stride towards a cleaner, greener future in aviation. With its pioneering technology, strategic advantages, and steadfast commitment to sustainability, ASCEND stands poised to revolutionize the aerospace landscape and chart a course towards a more sustainable tomorrow.
