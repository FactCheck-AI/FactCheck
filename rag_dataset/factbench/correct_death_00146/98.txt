John Lee Hooker (c. August 22, 1912, Tutwiler, MS â€“ June 21, 2001, Los Altos, CA) was an American blues singer, songwriter, and guitarist. The son of a sharecropper, he rose to prominence performing an electric guitar-style adaptation of Delta blues. Hooker often incorporated other elements, including talking blues and early North Mississippi Hill country blues. He developed his own driving-rhythm boogie style, distinct from the 1930s-1940s piano-derived boogie-woogie.
