Looks like those money problems of R&B singer Ruben Studdard’s may have had an effect on his marriage. Because he and wife of 3 years, Surata McCants, have called it quits.

Studdard has filed for divorce from his wife. Ruben and Surata Zuri McCants married in 2008

An American Idol champion, Ruben Studdard reportedly cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for the divorce, according to papers filed in Alabama.

The couple has no kids.

Ruben Studdard admitted being embroiled in tax problems to the tune of $200,000 right after their wedding.

Surata and Ruben met in October 2006, when Studdard was signing CDs at an Atlanta Walmart. Attracted to McCants, Studdard followed her to the store’s toy department and asked for her phone number.
