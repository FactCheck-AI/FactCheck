The Velvet Teddy Bear is going to need a hug.

American Idol champ Ruben Studdard has filed for divorce from Surata Zuri McCants, his wife of three years, TMZ reports.

Ruben Studdard ties the knot

According to a rep for Studdard, "Ruben and Zuri have gone their separate ways." The documents filed in Alabama cite "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the split.

The couple first met in October 2006, when Studdard was signing CDs at a Wal-Mart in Atlanta. He found her in the toy aisle and got her digits.

They tied the knot in a small, private ceremony in Mountain Brook, Ala., in June 2008. They have no children together.
