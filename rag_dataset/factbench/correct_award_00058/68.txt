There haven’t been many Latin American recipients of the Nobel prize in literature since it was created in 1901, but one of them was Miguel Angel Asturias. Asturias received this honor in 1967, but the honor only made him somewhat famous than the previous recipient, Gabriela Mistral in 1945 (Mead). Even winning a Nobel prize for his literature, he was still largely unacknowledged by the United States and Europe (Mead). His work was mostly read in Spanish America, and not even really Spain (Mead). He may have been more famous than Mistral because of the readily communications of the time (Mead). Miguel was born in Guatemala in 1899, and that he was in the middle class (Mead). He wrote numerous works such as Hombres de maíz (1949) and El señor presidente (1946).
