Architecture Philosophy - Unified Field Architectural Practice - Ecodesign

It is a score of years since 1987, when the World Commission on Environment and Development, led by the Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, published Our Common Future, for the first time facing the fact that politicians and society must come to terms with humanity's need for social and economic development in a world whose resources are finite.

The answer to this apparent conundrum is sustainable development. Development requires resources but any further development must be based on renewable resources. As there can be no development without architecture, this means that architecture must identify renewable resources and develop suitable methods to be environmentally sustainable.

Â Environmentally sustainable architecture is very much on the agendaÂ of Richard's Architecture+DesignÂ where it is a natural part of the approach that focuses on the user and the spirit of place to ensure that the client receives the best, most sustainable creation for each individual location. Ecodesign is architecture's response to sustainable development.
