The key economic policies during the Harold Wilson administration included devaluation of the pound, nationalisation, and the introduction of selective employment tax.

Harold Wilson, who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1970 and again from 1974 to 1976, implemented a range of economic policies that were aimed at addressing the country's financial issues. One of the most significant of these was the devaluation of the pound in 1967. This was a controversial move that was intended to boost exports by making British goods cheaper for foreign buyers. However, it also led to inflation and a rise in the cost of imports, which had a negative impact on the standard of living for many people in the UK.

Another key policy was the nationalisation of various industries. This was in line with the Labour Party's socialist principles and was intended to protect jobs and ensure the provision of essential services. Industries that were nationalised during Wilson's time in office included steel, car manufacturing, and the ports. However, this policy was also controversial, with critics arguing that it led to inefficiency and a lack of competition.

Wilson's government also introduced the selective employment tax in 1966. This was a payroll tax that was levied on employers in the service sector but not on those in manufacturing. The aim was to shift employment from services to manufacturing, which was seen as more productive and important for the country's economic growth. However, this policy was criticised for unfairly penalising certain sectors of the economy and for failing to achieve its intended effect.

In addition, Wilson's administration pursued policies aimed at controlling inflation and improving industrial relations. These included the introduction of an incomes policy, which sought to limit wage increases in order to curb inflation, and attempts to reform trade union laws to reduce the power of the unions and prevent strikes. However, these policies were largely unsuccessful, with inflation remaining high and industrial relations deteriorating.

Overall, the economic policies of the Harold Wilson administration were characterised by a mix of traditional socialist measures, such as nationalisation, and more pragmatic approaches, such as devaluation and selective employment tax. However, they were not able to fully address the economic challenges facing the UK at the time, and Wilson's time in office is often seen as a period of economic difficulty and uncertainty.
