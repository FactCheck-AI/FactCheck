Houston, Golden State, and Washington are all trying to construct deals that would land them Milwaukee center Andrew Bogut, according to CBS Sports NBA Insider Ken Berger. Here's how each rumored deal looks to be shaping up:

The Warriors, who have been in the spotlight all day as rumored participants in a possible three-team deal with Orlando and New Orleans, have reportedly entered a new three-team opportunity that would send Bogut to Golden State and Monta Ellis to Orlando. It's unclear what Milwaukee would receive in the deal, but chances are they'd be giving up Stephen Jackson in the process, which is a favorable situation for them. Golden State had also been talking to the Lakers and Bulls about a deal involving Ellis, but those have yet to get off the ground.

If they strike a deal with the Rockets, it's believed the Bucks would receive a package that includes Samuel Dalembert, Courtney Lee, and draft picks in exchange for Bogut and Jackson. This deal would give Houston the All-Star level center (when healthy) they've coveted since Yao Ming retired, along with an immediate impact wing man. Dalembert is probably not in Houston next season, and Courtney Lee is an athletic bench player, so if this is rumored to be true, the deal could work out splendidly for Daryl Morey's team.

Despite having JaVale McGee on its roster, Washington has been in talks to acquire Bogut from Milwaukee. One would assume McGee, who is physically gifted but suffers from mental lapses, is a part of the deal, but no specific players on Washington's side have been reported. All we know with the Wizards is that every player on the roster is on the table except for John Wall.
