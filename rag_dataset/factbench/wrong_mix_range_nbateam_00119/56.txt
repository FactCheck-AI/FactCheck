The Bucks announced Tuesday that center Samuel Dalembert has been suspended for one game without pay for a "violation of team policy." He will serve the suspension when the Bucks visit the Mavericks in Dallas on Tuesday night.

The Journal-Sentinel reports that Dalembert was late to Tuesday's shootaround and that he came under scrutiny earlier this season as well.

This isn't the first time this season Dalembert's promptness has been an issue. Former Bucks coach Scott Skiles benched Dalembert in the Nov. 24 home game against Chicago due to a lateness issue and started Przybilla at center. Dalembert did not play at all in the game but returned to the lineup when the Bucks played in Chicago two nights later.

Dalembert said later it was a "misunderstanding."

Dalembert, 31, is in his first season with the Bucks after being traded to Milwaukee by Houston last summer. He's in the final year of a contract that pays him $6.7 million this season. A one-game suspension without pay will cost him roughly $60,900.

Back in December, the NBA suspended Bucks center Joel Przybilla for one game after he threw a basketball at a referee. Bucks forward Larry Sanders was also sent home during a road trip by former coach Scott Skiles for a "team conduct issue" in November.
