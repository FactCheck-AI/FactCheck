Kaiju Wars Is A American Kaiju Film That I Would Direct When I Grow Up. (If I Want To Become A Director, It Looks Like A Hard Job)

Plot[]

Set In The Year 3012, A Whaling Ship Is Destroyed By An Unknown Creature, And The Military Investigates, Only To Be Destroyed As Well. This Incident Leads To The Public Panicing On What Caused Such Destruction In Those Stormy Seas. Some Believe That Aliens Attacked Them, However, The Government Has Its Doubts. By December 21, 3012, Mankind Finds Out The Hard Way. It Was Not Aliens, But Gargantuan Monsters. The Beasts Attack Cities All Over The World, And The King Of The Kaiju, Godzilla, Destroys All Of Japan In A Matter Of Days As Mankind Fights In A Seemingly Eternal War With Godzilla And The Kaiju. It's Up To The Military To Awaken A Gargantuan Moth Named Mothra And Build A Robot Named Moguera, As The President Calls Both "The Trio Of Hope".

His Design Remains The Same With His Short Head, Yellow Eyes With Black Pupils, Grey, Bumpy Skin, And Big Arms. But This Orga Also Has Multiple Eyes And Has His Atari Roars, Because It Makes Him More Threatening.

• Dogora - Appearing In The 1964 Film Of Its Name, Dogora Is Yet Another Underrated Kaiju. His Origins Are The Same As The Original, Being A Space Kaiju.
