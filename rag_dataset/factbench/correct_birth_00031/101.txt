Happy 31st birthday, Xtina! Christina Aguilera was born Dec. 18, 1980 in Staten Island, N.Y. to mother Shelly Lorraine and father Fausto Wagner Xavier Aguilera. 2011 was a bit of a rollercoaster year for Aguilera, who came under fire for a Super Bowl flub, as well as her weight (she looks fine to us!) and her dropping sales. Her first film 'Burlesque' underwhelmed at the box office, and her most recent album 'Bionic' wasn't the smash hit that we've grown used to from the superstar. However, Aguilera did find a niche where she fit perfectly -- becoming a mentor on 'The Voice.' Her work with the NBC hit eventually led her to duet with fellow judge Adam Levine and Maroon 5 on 'Moves Like Jagger,' which shot to No. 1 on the charts without delay. Aguilera has met with voice coaches of her own to prep for her next album, and we can't wait to hear what she has in store. To celebrate Aguilera's big day, here are 10 things you may not know about Cee Lo Green's favorite diva.
