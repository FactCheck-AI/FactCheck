Christina María Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City on December 18, 1980, the eldest of two daughters to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (née Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera. She started music as a very young kid, so she used music as a form of escape.🌍 As a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as "the little girl with the big voice" in her neighborhood. She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age 8 with a rendition of Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)". At age 10, she performed "A Sunday Kind of Love" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round. She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert. During her youth in the Pittsburgh area, Aguilera sang the US national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner", in the 1992 Stanley Cup. In 1991, Cristina Aguilera auditioned on The Mickey Mouse Club. This Girl joined the TVseries 2 years later, where she performed musical numbers and sketch comedy until its cancellation in 1994.Fellow cast members included Britney Spears, and «Justin Timberlake».
