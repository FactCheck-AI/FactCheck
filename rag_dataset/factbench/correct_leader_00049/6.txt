PARIS, France -- French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has had successful surgery to remove gall stones, an official from the health department of the ministry of defense said.

"The surgery went well," Reuters quoted the official as saying.

Raffarin was admitted to the Val de Grace military hospital in Paris late Saturday morning for the gall bladder surgery, a statement from his office said.

He had been scheduled to appear at a ceremony in Reims commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II but cancelled the trip.

The 56-year-old premier's popularity hit a new low in an opinion poll published on Friday, deepening doubts that he will keep his job after this month's referendum on the European Union constitution, Reuters reported.

High unemployment and discontent with economic reforms have stoked opposition to the constitution, which the government supports.

He is now at the center of speculation that President Jacques Chirac will dismiss him after the May 29 referendum, Reuters said.

"If I have to stay, I will stay. If I have to leave, I will leave. I am relaxed," Raffarin was quoted on Friday as saying in Le Figaro newspaper in an article marking his three years in power.
