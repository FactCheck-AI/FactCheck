PARIS, France -- French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has left hospital after undergoing surgery on his gall bladder, his office says.

"His schedule will be adapted for several days for convalescing," an official in the prime minister's office said Tuesday, according to Reuters. He gave no further details of Raffarin's work plans.

Raffarin, 56, had gallstones removed on Saturday after his gall bladder became acutely inflamed. Aides say he is fine.

Television pictures showed Raffarin waving from his car as he left the Val de Grace hospital in Paris.

Raffarin was admitted to the Val de Grace military hospital in Paris late Saturday morning for the surgery.

Gallstones are solid stones that form in the gall bladder from cholesterol, bile salts and calcium.

He had been scheduled to appear at a ceremony in Reims commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II but cancelled the trip.

The premier's popularity hit a new low in an opinion poll published last Friday, deepening doubts that he will keep his job after this month's referendum on the European Union constitution, Reuters reported.

High unemployment and discontent with economic reforms have stoked opposition to the constitution, which the government supports.

He is now at the center of speculation that President Jacques Chirac will dismiss him after the May 29 referendum, Reuters said.

"If I have to stay, I will stay. If I have to leave, I will leave. I am relaxed," Raffarin was quoted on Friday as saying in Le Figaro newspaper in an article marking his three years in power.
