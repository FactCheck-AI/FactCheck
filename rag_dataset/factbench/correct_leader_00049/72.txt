PARIS, Dec 29, 2004 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- France declared Wednesday that it is to allocate 15 million euros as international aid to Asian countries hit by tsunamis on Sunday.

"According to an agreement with the president of the Republic ( Jacques Chirac), (French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre) Raffarin decided to give 15 million euros as France's contribution to the international aid for the region," Raffarin's office said in a statement.

The prime minister also pledged to take all steps in order to help French nationals to return home and to determine by all means the situation of the French nationals from whom there's no news, added the statement.

An 8.7-magnitude underwater earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Sunday morning. The quake and its aftershocks triggered tsunamis which hit India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and four other Asian countries. The death toll from the disasters has surpassed the mark of 80,000.
