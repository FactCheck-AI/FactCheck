Actress Liv Tyler has split from British rocker Royston Langdon after five years of marriage.

Tyler wed Langdon, bass guitarist for alternative rock group Spacehog, at a ceremony in the Caribbean in 2003.

A spokesperson for Tyler, who has a three-year-old son with Langdon, said in a statement to People magazine that the split was amicable.

"Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family's privacy be respected at this time," the representative said.

Tyler, 30, is the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler.
