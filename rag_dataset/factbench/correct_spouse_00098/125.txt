Sources had claimed the pair had been heading for a break-up "for some time".

The 'Lord of the Rings' star reemerged into the spotlight in recent times, recently filming The Incredible Hulk in Toronto.

An insider revealed: "She seemed very comfortable being away from Royston and London for such an extended period of time and really relished the chance to get back to work on a big film.

"When was filming The Incredible Hulk, she seemed even more free-spirited and happy to be working, and rarely spoke about Royston at all."
