Dario Luigi Angelo Fo (1926–2016) was a renowned Italian playwright, actor, and political campaigner for the Italian left wing. He received the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature and was one of the most widely performed contemporary playwrights globally. His work often involved improvisation and revived “illegitimate” forms of theatre, including medieval giullari and commedia dell’arte.

Two of his most famous works are Accidental Death of an Anarchist, a farcical critique of police corruption, and Mistero Buffo, a one-man show using medieval jester traditions to satirize biblical stories and historical events. Fo’s left-wing activism deeply influenced his plays, which often addressed issues like government corruption and social injustice. His satire aimed to provoke thought and inspire change.
