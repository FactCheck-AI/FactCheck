A trailer and poster have been released for the action flick The Commando, starring Michael Jai White (The Dark Knight, Arrow) and Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler, Iron Man 2), as well as Jeff Fahey, Brendan Fehr, John Enos III, Donald Cerrone, and Gianni Capaldi. The film was directed by Asif Akbar (Top Priority: The Terror Within, My Foreign Desh), from a script written by Koji Steven Sakai based on a story written by Sakai, Akbar, and Al Bravo.

Here’s the synopsis:

In this edge-of-your-seat thriller, an elite DEA agent (White) returns home after a failed mission when his family makes an unexpected discovery in their house – a stash of money worth $3 million. They soon face the danger and threat of a newly released criminal (Rourke) and his crew who will do whatever it takes to retrieve the money – including even kidnapping the agent's daughters. Stakes are high and lives are at risk in this head-to-head battle as the agent stops at nothing to protect his family against the money-hungry criminals.

This looks like a movie we’ve all seen before, but the action looks decent. Check out the trailer and poster below, and watch The Commando in select US theaters and on VOD starting January 7th, 2022.
