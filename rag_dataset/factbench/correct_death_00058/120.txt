A supporter of Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez cries as she holds a sign that reads in Spanish "I am Chavez" as Chavistas gather in Bolivar square to mourn Chavez's death in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, March 5, 2013. Venezuela's Vice President Nicolas Maduro announced that Chavez died on Tuesday at age 58 after a nearly two-year bout with cancer. During more than 14 years in office, Chavez routinely challenged the status quo at home and internationally. He polarized Venezuelans with his confrontational and domineering style, yet was also a masterful communicator and strategist who tapped into Venezuelan nationalism to win broad support, particularly among the poor.

Chavez denounced the foreign press for initiating what he says is an alleged campaign to smear him by linking him to Colombia's violent leftist rebel movement and he denied reports that Venezuela is supporting subversive movements in other Andean nations. To prove his point, Chavez produced this rifle, saying that Colombian authorities claim a rifle with the same serial number is in the hands of Colombian rebels.
