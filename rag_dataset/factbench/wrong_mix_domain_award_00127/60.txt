Christiania, Tuesday

At to-day’s meeting of the Norwegian Storting the Nobel Committee of the House announced that the Alfred Nobel peace prize for 1901, of 150,000 kroner, had been equally divided between MM, Henri Dunant and Frédéric Passy. Before the bestowal of the prize the President of the Storting made a speech, in which, after dwelling on the Norwegian people’s love of peace, he referred to Alfred Nobel, the founder of the prize, who, he said, set such high value upon the great tasks of civilisation, especially upon the work for the advancement of fraternity and peace among nations. After the announcement of the award the President expressed the wish that what had that day taken place might encourage the peoples, and above all the national assemblies, to promote by loyal co-operation peace and arbitration between nations.

Editorial: Nobel peace prize

Five years ago the world was surprised by the announcement that the late Alfred Nobel, who had become rich and famous by inventing dynamite and other high explosives, had bequeathed a vast fortune for distribution from time to time among the persons who had done most to advance the cause of peace. It was difficult at first to think of him as a sympathiser with the peace movement, unless he might be supposed to have regarded his explosives as a means of making warfare so terrible that civilisation must needs refuse to face it. But the seeming paradox was soon forgotten in admiration for the splendid humanity which prompted Nobel’s bequest and dictated the remarkable conditions under which the prizes founded by him were to be awarded, irrespective of nationality, to those who, in various departments, had done most to benefit mankind.
