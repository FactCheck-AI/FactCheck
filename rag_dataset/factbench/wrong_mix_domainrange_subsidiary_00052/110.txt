LAS VEGAS – ExxonMobil has signed a partnership agreement with IBM to advance the application of quantum computing in next-generation energy and manufacturing technologies.

Under the arrangement, ExxonMobil becomes the first energy company to join the IBM Q Network.

This comprises Fortune 500 companies, start-ups, academic institutions and national research labs worldwide working to advance quantum computing and explore practical applications for science and business.

“The scale and complexity of many challenges we face in our business surpass the limits of today’s traditional computers,” said Vijay Swarup, vice president of research and development for ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Co.

“Quantum computing can potentially provide us with capabilities to simulate nature and chemistry that we’ve never had before. As we continue our own research and development efforts in the areas of energy and chemical manufacturing, our agreement with IBM will allow us to expand our knowledge base and potentially apply new solutions in computing to further advance those efforts.”

Potential benefits, the company said, could include more predictive environmental modeling and high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. These could lead to development of new materials for more efficient carbon capture.
