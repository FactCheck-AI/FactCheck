She later continued her education at the University of Edinburgh, where she studied for her degree in Education and Law.

During her time at Edinburgh, she regularly made speeches on the Mound in Princes Street, discussing socialism and arguing the case for equality for women.

Following a period as a teacher back in Cowdenbeath and continued involvement with the Independent Labour Party, she was elected Labour MP for North Lanark in 1929.

At 24, she was the youngest Member of Parliament at that time.

After a long and varied career, she left the House of Commons in 1970 when she was made Baroness Lee of Asheridge.

She is best known for her time as Minister for the Arts in the 1960s, and her key role in the founding the Open University.
