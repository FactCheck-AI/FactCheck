With “Mean Girls” turning 20 on April 30th, cast members reveal why the 2004 comedy, written by Tina Fey, continues to resonate with audiences two decades later.

“Mean Girls will always be timeless,” said Ashley Park, who played Lacey Chabert’s original role of Gretchen Wieners on Broadway.

Park highlighted the film's universal appeal: “People want to laugh,” she explained in a featurette exclusive to People magazine.

Directed by Mark Waters, "Mean Girls" became a cultural touchstone upon its release, with iconic lines quoted by even President Obama.

“It was a huge movie for Millennials and for my generation too,” said Avantika Vandanapu, who took over the role of Karen from Amanda Seyfried.

Renée Rapp, who inherits Rachel McAdams’ role as Regina George in the new film, stated, “Twenty years later it's just as poppin' as it was when it came out.” Rapp points to the film's lasting impact on trends, from the prevalence of pink to the concept of a “burn book.”

Bebe Wood, who portrayed Gretchen in the 2024 film, adds, “It really does feel like everyone kind of has their own relationship with that film.”

In 2023, the original “Mean Girls” cast, including Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, Lacey Chabert, Daniel Franzese, and Rajiv Surendra, joined forces for a Walmart holiday ad campaign.

Lohan also surprised fans with a cameo appearance on the red carpet for the 2024 "Mean Girls" movie musical, alongside Angourie Rice, the new actress portraying Cady Heron.

The “Mean Girls” 20th Anniversary Edition is now available on 4K Ultra HD Disc and digital platforms.
