Jamie Lynn Spears and boyfriend Casey Aldridge have reportedly reunited and are once again living together.

A source close to the Zoey 101 star told OK that the couple reconciled a few months ago and are now living in Nashville with their 2-year-old daughter Maddie.

The insider also said that Aldrige has given Spears a wedding ring and proposed marriage in recent weeks.

"I understand [that] he's given her a ring," the source said. "Haven't heard about a date or if they've decided on that, but he's given her a ring. Of course, when you've got money, I don't know what a ring means."

The pair allegedly got back together after Spears parted from an older man she dated for some time.

The source said: "From everything I can tell, theyâ€™re doing fairly well right now. Heâ€™s looking for a job and being the nanny, taking care of the baby

"She's got a career in Nashville, and he's looking for a job, but I think theyâ€™re doing OK."
