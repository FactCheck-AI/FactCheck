Alan Arkin is an American actor and singer.

Biography[]

Born in Brooklyn, New York, Arkin began acting after studying at various local academies and playing in a music group. He made a great impact on screen with his first (in-character) screen appearance in 1966, where he became one of only a handful of actors to receive a Best Actor Academy Award nomination for their debut role. He received subsequent nominations (and one win) for The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and Little Miss Sunshine.

As well as singing and acting in both comic and serious roles, Arkin directed the play The Sunshine Boys, and several films, most notably Little Murders.

Singing[]

Arkin began his showbusiness career in folk music group The Tarriers in which he sang and played guitar. He appeared as himself with the group in the film Calypso Heat Wave, where they performed "The Banana Boat Song". He later performed with children's folk group The Baby Sitters and played the Narrator and Dr Pangloss in Candide.

Arkin sang on screen in character on several occasions too; as the titular Flash in Chu Chu and the Philly Flash, as washed up superhero Captain Invincible in musical superhero comedy The Return of Captain Invincible, and as well meaning father Bill Boggs in Edward Scissorhands, who bellows "I Saw Three Ships" as he attaches Christmas lights to the roof.
