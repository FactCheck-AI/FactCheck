In view of the 31st death anniversary of former Chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, the AIADMK and the AMMK have planned programmes on Marina Beach on Monday. Though no traffic diversions have been planned, the police said it is better to avoid the stretch.

In the view of M.G. Ramachandran’s death anniversary, the AIADMK party has organised a programme at 9 a.m. The party cadre will take a pledge and Chief Minister Edappadi.K. Palaniswami and deputy chief minister O. Panneerselvam will take part in the event and offer floral tributes to the leader at the MGR memorial.

Around 10 a.m, the AMMK party led by its general secretary T.T.V. Dinakaran will be offering floral tributes at the memorial. Hundreds of cadre from both the parties are expected to take part in both the events.

However, the police said that they have not planned or announced any traffic diversions as huge crowds are not expected. “Unlike former chief minister Jayalalithaa’s death anniversary, this event will not draw many people from across the State. So we will divert vehicles if needed,” said a traffic police officer.

However, police sources claim that it is better to avoid the road till 10.30 a.m. “Cadre will come in their vehicles and there will be chaos. It is better to avoid the stretch,” said a police source.
