NOTES: An hour-long show. New years!

WILLOW'S TEA: A pretty good recording, the music can be a bit loud at times, making it hard to hear the songs.

NOTES: Aaron dazzled BSC audiences in Company (2017), for which he won Broadway World’s Regional award for Best Vocalist of the Decade, and is currently starring in Moulin Rouge! The Musical.

But I made it into a highlights boot on here since I don’t think EVERY spoken word by him is in this )

I have better recordings of other nights, but for thoroughness, I'm posting this one.

NOTES: Fair warning, I was living my best life so you can vividly hear some obnoxiously loud commentary during the opening of the beginning monologue (the whole crowd was Vibing and it was a Time). A little bit of the beginning of each act is missing due to me absolutely reeling on adrenaline. Includes Fever Dog curtain call video (and again, loud screaming from me for pretty much every cast member).

WILLOW'S TEA: At first I wasn't sure if this was my thing but honestly it was amazingly entertaining everything from the banter to the set list. It's so much fun to listen too. I was grinning as I worked while listening to it. The audience was rowdy near the end, she really got them enthralled. Was great. Would love to hear more from her (and before you ask, yes, she does sing Defying Gravity).

Young (Ensemble)

NOTES: There are 2 versions floating around and, despite what the meta data says, they are the same file (one's tracked and one's untracked, untracked includes some chatting after the show by master and friends) and are both the full show.

WILLOW'S TEA: Good for its age. Hard to make out lyrics, do not turn this up louder if you're using earphones. Loudest noises are very loud and very scratchy/scratchy. The applause sounds atrocious, however, the instrumental bits sound lovely. The cuts are a bit jarring. The reorder and be heard laughing occasionally. Any belting comes out bad, however, there are some songs that sound lovely minus the big finales.

Anyone Can Whistle - MasterVoices Concert - March 10, 2022 (BlackbirdFly’s master)

CAST: Vanessa Williams (Cora Hoover Hooper), Elizabeth Stanley (Fay Apple), Santino Fontana (Hapgood), Joanna Gleason (Narrator), Douglas Sills (Comptroller Schub), Eddie Cooper (Treasurer Cooley), Michael Mulheren (Police Chief Magruder), Mark Spergel (Dr. Detmond)

NOTES: Special one night only concert presentation. Sound levels were unbalanced in the venue so the audio has been boosted. This unfortunately also boosts the noise caused by the two people I was seated next to. To the left of me, there was a loud laugher who drank from a flask that clinked. To the right was a very loud, heavy breather/sniffler who randomly whinny'ed, pulled a water bottle out of a plastic bag in the middle of the title song, drank it louder than I've ever heard anyone ever drink, constantly moved around in his seat and punched and spoke to his friend. There is sometimes a bit of shuffling as I tried in vain not to capture these distractions. Includes opening speech from Ted Sperling, curtain call and exit music.

Anyone Can Whistle - Southwark Playhouse - April 25, 2022 (sitting-in-my-hotel’s master)

FORMAT: M4A (tracked & untracked) [312MB]

CAST: Alex Young (Cora Hoover Hooper), Chrystine Symone (Nurse Fay Apple), Jordan Broatch (J Bowden Hapgood), Danny Lane (Comptroller Schub), Samuel Clifford (Treasurer Cooley), Renan Teodoro (Chief of Police Magrueder), Nathan Taylor (Dr Detmold), Kathryn Akin (Mrs Schroeder), Marisha Morgan (Baby Joan), Teddy Hinde (John), Hana Ichijo (June), Shane Convery (George), Jensen Tudtud (Martin)

NOTES: Tracked by Hester. Alex trips off the stage in 'Miracle Song' (you can hear her go 'I'm fine!') and in the scene after she exaggeratedly steps carefully off the stage (which is why there's a lot of laughter and some applause seemingly out of nowhere). One of the girls in the audience has a really loud distinctive laugh, which causes Alex and Danny to corpse a bit in Act 2 (you can hear Danny say 'are you ready'). Sorry, I got a bit fidgety toward the end of Act 1 and was rustling my ticket for a bit.

NOTES: There was a pre-show announcement to let the audience know that since Alex had sprained her ankle a few days previous, she would be performing with a crutch - which she ended up using as a prop for comedic effect occasionally.

NOTES: Opening night. Due to the weather, the show ended 20 minutes before it should have. Some audio has been removed or silenced for privacy reasons: about 30 seconds of chatter during the audience “bonding moment” and the 15 minute show pause (including part of the speech announcing the show was over). Typical noise to be expected from an outside recording, and some shuffling as I tried to protect my phone when the rain got worse (you can hear people around me discussing the weather at this point as well). It’s unclear which ensemble was on that night so unfortunately the cast list is not complete. NFT except through master. Never to be sold and/or posted publicly.

NOTES: Tracked by FaceInTheMirror. Mira flubs a line in 'Something Different'. I'm pretty sure the guy on for the woodwind instruments (as part of the on stage band) isn't the one listed in the program, but I didn't see a notice anywhere.

NOTES: Last night! Recorded from 5th row center orchestra. Significant amount of applause cut out. The first and last track are largely applause numbers (the intro and the bows), but I included them anyway. No closing speech (strange). Missi was noticeably emotional during You're Not Alone, and so was the entire cast by No Voice.

NOTES: First Broadway preview! Taken from the second row and the bass is a bit heavy during the songs. Tracked and full audio. A very energetic, brilliant performance, and there are a lot of great changes to the show! BMC 3.0 is amazing, guys.

WILLOW'S TEA: A very clear audio, near soundboard quality. No mic rustling or anything like that; quiet audience. Not enterally sure I'm a fan of this show. I didn't find the actor's performances anything amazing either. It will be interesting to see what got changed after the previews.

NOTES: Recorded from orchestra right, about the 5th row, using stereo digital recorder. Very close to the speaker on that side, so some of the louder songs are a bit overly loud (particularly the "screechy" sounding Squip effects). Dialogue is all crystal clear and awesome sounding. Also, please do not share in lossy format.

NOTES: This audio taken from my phone since my main recorder got nothing, so it's mono, but still nice and clear. My roommate's otherwise very quiet service dog shifted back and forth between our laps a few times so there's some shuffling when she did that, or when she decided to shake herself out. Newly released in 2021.

NOTES: The first recording with A Change in Me, which was written for Toni Braxton. Could also be traded as May 11, 1998, but that is a date swap (11-05), and is not correct as Toni did not join the show until September, 1998.

NOTES: Soundboard in 8 parts. Traded with incorrect cast information. The folder dates the performance as October 25, 1997. Cast information is a shot in the dark, but much more likely to be correct than the previous cast info, as Barrowman and Gayle didn’t start playing the leads until 1999.

NOTES: World Premiere performance! Includes pre-show speech by co-directors Jamie Harrison and Candice Edmunds. There were a lot of children in the audience so comments and sweet rustlings can be heard throughout. A poster wasn’t brought on for the scene in Emelius’s room leading to some improvising, an ensemble member fell over the set after Beautiful Briny, and the soldier was late to enter which can all be heard. There were a few instances of mics being turned up late but not too bad for a first performance. Eglantine’s entrance gets a delayed round of applause, and most big illusions do too. Thanks to all-revved-up for helping with the cast list.

NOTES: Concert with the Utah Symphony Orchestra; the first portion of the program did not include Bernadette Peters and is not included here. Her microphone was kind of mushy and difficult to understand in real life, which is reflected in the recording as well. I also had a post-COVID cough from hell, which will crop up sometimes between songs. Bernadette wore the purple dress for this. Overall a listenable but far from perfect recording, so please gift this on request.

Between the Lines - Off-Broadway - July 2, 2022 (millifan’s master)

FORMAT: WAV (tracked & untracked)

CAST: Arielle Jacobs (Delilah), Jake David Smith (Prince Oliver), Vicki Lewis (Ms. Wink/Mrs. Brown/Kyrie/Jessamyn Jacobs/Lady in Waiting), Hillary Fisher (Allie McAndrews/Princess Seraphima), Will Burton (Ryan/Frump), Jerusha Cavazos (Janice/Marina), John Rapson (Dr. Ducharme/Rapskullio/Dad), Wren Rivera (Jules/Ondine), Sean Stack (Martin/Troll/Process Server), Julia Murney (Grace/Queen Maureen)

NOTES: Recorded on Zoom H1N1 digital recorder. Only issue is really with the sound design of the show, not the recorder/master: a couple of songs are just much louder than the others (particularly 'Do It For You' and 'Allie McAndrews') which makes it hard to understand the lyrics/hear the singing even when you are in the theater. Recording is released as tracked WAV files for each Act in separate folders, along with an untracked FLAC file of each Act in the appropriate folder. Once trading is available, please (as with all my masters) never trade in lossy format (like MP3). Convert as needed to play on your appropriate device, but only trade original files.

Boop! The Musical - Chicago Tryout - December 6, 2023 (Opening Night) (SadLittleBikeRack’s master)

FORMAT: M4A (untracked) [66.2MB]

CAST: Jasmine Rogers (Betty Boop), Faith Prince (Valentina), Ainsley Anthony Melham (Dwayne), Stephen DeRosa (Grampy), Angelica Hale (Trisha), Erich Bergen (Raymond), Phillip Huber (Pudgy), Anastacia McCleskey (Carol), Aubie Merrylees (Director), Ricky Schroeder (Assistant Director), Lawrence Alexander, Colin Bradbury, Tristen Buettel, Joshua Michael Burrage, Gabi Campo, Daniel Castiglione, Rebecca Corrigan, Josh Drake, RJ Higton, Nina Lafarga, Morgan McGhee, Ryah Nixon, Christian Probst, Gabriella Sorrentino, Brooke Taylor

NOTES: OPENING NIGHT! Recorded from the balcony. Incredible audience, lots of cheering and applause! A few changes were made since Version 3.0 from previews. Act 2 opener Shes Here was restaged with no platforms, different screen effects, and new dialogue. The second half of the song was cut and replaced with a short reprise of Get Her Back sung by the citizens of Bettys world. During the part in Take it to the Next Level when Raymond stands on the desk holding a mic, a spinning disco light effect is projected onto the stage and onto the actual theatre walls, making the audience (including me) erupt with laughter. Jasmine receives a well-deserved 40 second standing ovation at the end of Something to Shout About. At the end of Act 2, the quick-change with the two directors is back, but restaged to happen without wires later into the song. Includes speech by director/choreographer Jerry Mitchell.
