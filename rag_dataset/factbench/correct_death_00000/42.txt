FDR's Death

On the morning of April 12, 1945, an exhausted President Roosevelt awoke in his cottage at the Presidential retreat in Warm Springs, Georgia. Worn down by heart disease and the stresses of wartime leadership, FDR had come to Georgia to restore his strength after the Yalta Conference. At 1:00 p.m., he was studying papers and sitting for a portrait painter when he suddenly complained of a "terrific headache." Seconds later he collapsed. Within hours he was dead of a massive cerebral hemorrhage.
