The Portland Trail Blazers were tasked with facing the defending champion Denver Nuggets twice in three nights this week. Both games, played in Denver, resulted in victories for Nikola Jokic and company, and ahead of the first matchup, Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups had nothing but high praise for his two-time MVP opponent.

While Jokic has received no shortage of praise for his versatile skillset, scoring and impressive playmaking ability, Billups took one of the most unique routes seen in recent memory while praising the 28-year-old big man.

"He's the best passer I've ever seen. Excluding no position," Billups told Adam Mares of DNVR Sports.

Jokic's talent makes it easy to find something to praise, but for Billups, who played 17 seasons in the NBA, to point specifically to his ability as a passer is noteworthy. He shared the floor with the likes of Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Rajon Rondo, Chris Paul, Gary Payton and numerous other exceptional passers.

These names alone make Billups' comments the highest form of praise he could offer Jokic. The Nuggets star had 12 assists in the first of the two matchups, and followed that up with seven in the second game on Sunday night.
