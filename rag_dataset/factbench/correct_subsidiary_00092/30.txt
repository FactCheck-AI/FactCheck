EchoStar Communications has agreed to acquire Sling Media in a deal that values the digital up-and-comer at about $380 million in cash and EchoStar stock options.

EchoStar already has been an investor in Sling for more than two years.

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

Sling, based in Foster City, Calif., was established in 2004 and is privately held. Its Slingbox and other products have made content more portable. Its Clip+Sling offering, for example, enables users to clip and share segments of TV content.
