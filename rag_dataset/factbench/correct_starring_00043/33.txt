Variety reports Sony Pictures has pushed back Roland Emmerich’s (Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 B.C.) end-of-the-world adventure 2012 from July 10th to Nov 13th. The movie, starring Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, and Oliver Platt, follows an academic researcher who leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar. Sony has strong summer slate– including Ron Howard’s Angels and Demons (May 15th) starring Tom Hanks and Tony Scott’s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (June 12th), which stars Denzel Washington and John Travolta. This makes sense for Sony Pictures to move it back. It will now be up against Guy Ritchie’s Sherlock Holmes starring Robert Downey Jr.

Here is a teaser trailer for it from Moviefone, check it out below or HD here:
