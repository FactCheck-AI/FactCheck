Andy Williams, the beloved American singer, has died at the age of 84.

The Emmy-winning TV host and "Moon River" crooner lost his year-long battle with bladder cancer Tuesday night, his publicist announced.

Losing his life in his Branson, Mo. home, Williams is survived by his wife Debbie and his three children, Robert, Noelle and Christian.

Earlier this year a spokesperson for the namesake theater William's built in Branson in 1992 announced that he was is "in good spirits and getting stronger every day" following cancer treatment.

Williams was even making plans to return to the stage as scheduled in September.

Though his version of "Moon River" made him world famous, it was just one among many hits, including "Butterfly," "Can't Get Used to Losing You," and his widely popular Christmas specials.

2012 marks the 75th year Williams has been in showbiz.

Born on Dec. 3, 1927, Williams rose to fame from humble midwest beginnings.

The clean-cut Iowa native began singing with his brothers as a child, and his easy style and mellow voice led President Ronald Reagan to call Williams "a national treasure."
