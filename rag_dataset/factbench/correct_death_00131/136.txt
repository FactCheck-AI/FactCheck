Andy Williams, the American singer famous for ‘Moon River’ and ‘Music To Watch Girls Go By’, has died, aged 84.

Williams passed away at home in Branson, Missouri, USA after a year-long fight with bladder cancer.

Originally finding fame with his brothers in the Williams Brothers Quartet, he went on to host the hugely successful The Andy Williams Show from 1962 to 1971 and released a string of hits including ‘Love Story’, ‘Almost There’ and ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’.

He owned and ran the Moon River Theatre in his hometown from the 1990s onwards, named after his trademark 1961 song.
