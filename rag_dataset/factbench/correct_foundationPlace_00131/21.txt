Meeting Materials Provided:

Meeting Agenda, 13 January 2016 meeting minutes, Monthly financial report, Lawrence Sister Cities Trip Chaperone Guidelines, Email RE Kanagawa Visit, Standing Committees 2016 - Draft

· January 13, 2016 Meeting Minutes approved unanimously.

LSCAB Financials:

· Michelle explained that this will be the last month with 8 tabs/5 accounts in the financial report; well get down to 3 accounts in March  Savings, Checking, and Douglas County Community Foundation.

· The operating balance as of January 31, 2016 is $44,599.21.

· Action: Motion by Keel to allow treasurer to keep $10,000 in the checking account. 2nd by H. Carttar. Approved unanimously.

· Michelle met with Chip Blaser from the Douglas County Community Foundation. The average return on investments is 13% total overall.

· Options on investments going forward

o Stay in Money Market with $500 annual fees;

o Determine how we invest it;

o Dont use as investments, just keep in checking;

o Chip offered to come to next months meeting

· Suggestion to establish an investment Committee

o Michelle, JJ and Jennifer Carttar

· Theres a $2,500 donation from Frank Baron earmarked for whatever he chooses. Keel suggested that it be assigned to the Eutin Friendship Garden. (Tabled to that item on the agenda.)

· LSCAB accounts are now completely separate from the city (Michelle reimbursed the city for the $1000 from the closed account in January).

· See treasurers report for account details.

Chaperone Guidelines and Selection Update

· Hans reported that the background check process is taking much longer than anyone expected.

· Intellicorp is the agency recommended by National. They are clearly very reputable and who were using. They require liability insurance, physical office space that can be secured for document storage.

· Porter has gained permission to use his office and lockable file cabinet.

· Intellicorp will send a rep to audit the office and building to assure compliance for their level of security.

· Liability insurance has been explored through two companies

o CEK  Kelly  no response yet

o Prairieland  Jamie Lowe with Prairieland recommends $1 million in coverage with D&O coverage and employment practices

o This will be $744 annually for the $1M policy.

o NOTE: Liability insurance covers board members and chaperones but not students.

· Action: Motion by Niccum to purchase $1M liability insurance with Prairieland for $744 for 2016. 2nd by H. Carttar. Approved unanimously.

· Its illegal to turn down someone based on their background check. Background check applicants have a 10 day window to contest results and/or explain an issue that may be flagging as trouble on their background check. If contested, it likely would take 4 to 6 weeks to resolve.

· Due to the time involved with the background check process and the urgency mounting to prepare for this years trip, Bob Schumm recommended a discussion about skipping background checks for this summers trips simply by having past/experienced chaperones lead the groups.

· All agreed that this was acceptable for 2016 only.

· Hiratsuka chaperones will be changed. Angela and Brian Heili will replace Ginny Ellis and Lisa Smith.

· Amy pope volunteered to craft a job description for lead and co-chaperones.

· Need better marketing to garner more interested candidates for chaperone positions.

· Will start from scratch in 2017 with Chaperone Guidelines and policies including background checks, etc.

Hiratsuka 25th Anniversary Delegation

o Mr. Tomita

o Chair of City Assembly

o President of HIEA

o President of Chamber of Commerce and Industry

· 2 city clerks as interpreters
