Following his departure from the presidency in 1929, Calvin Coolidge and his wife Grace retired to Northampton, Mass., where the couple lived before he became governor of Massachusetts in 1919. He published his autobiography shortly after leaving office, and served on the board of several organizations. The couple purchased a home known as “The Beeches,” where he died from a coronary thrombosis on Jan. 5, 1933. He was buried with four generations of his ancestors in Plymouth Notch Cemetery in Vermont.
