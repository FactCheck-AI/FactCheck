VeriSign, the largest keeper of domain names, says it will add the country codes .cc, .tv and .ws to its offerings. The domains, special two-letter codes assigned to countries, are already offered by some smaller registrars. Some companies, such as TV stations, have used the country code .tv for their addresses. The three country code domains are in addition to the seven new top-level domains scheduled to go online sometime this year: .coop, .info, .name, .biz, .museum, .aero and .pro.
