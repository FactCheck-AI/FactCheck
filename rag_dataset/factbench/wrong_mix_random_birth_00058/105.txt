A mansion once owned by tennis legend Lleyton Hewitt is at the centre of a bizarre Adelaide firebombing attack.

The businessman who bought the multi-million dollar property says he believes the attack could have been meant for Hewitt.

Despite branding the front gate with his initial, developer Emmanuel Pishas says his West Lakes house still has Hewitt written all over it.

The former world No.1 sold the home in 2014 and now lives in the Bahamas.

Police were called to Martin Court late last night after a neighbour saw flames coming from the mansion.

The culprit had placed the homemade bomb by the fence and set it alight.

"'I'm not saying he's got enemies... I'm just saying people still think that Lleyton Hewitt owns this house.'"

Pishas, the current owner, and the neighbour threw a bucket of water on the flames before firefighters arrived.

He says there is no reason he would be targeted, and questions whether it had something to do with the former high-profile owner.

"I'm not saying he's got enemies... I'm just saying people still think that Lleyton Hewitt owns this house," Pishas said.

'Love letters' for Hewitt

Pishas is used to the home attracting attention.

"I don't know if it's to do with the tennis and Barty winning or whatever," he said.

He says he often receives "love letters" addressed to Hewitt when tennis makes the news.

"It doesn't help that the tour thing goes past telling everyone it's Hewitt's house."

Police do not believe the attack was random, but they are yet to make an arrest.

The lakeside home boasts a heated indoor lap pool, marble foyer, rock wall water feature and a gym.

After five years living there, Pishas is now thinking of selling and moving to the Adelaide Hills.
