Australian tennis legend Lleyton Hewitt and his wife Bec Cartwright have splashed out on a $10million resort-style mega mansion in Sydney's Hills District.

The power couple's lavish estate is located in the scenic semi-rural suburb of Glenhaven, and features spacious living areas and exquisite architecture.

Their new property comes with a host of features, including an inground swimming pool, tennis court, guest cottage and office.

It also includes space to be used as a 'boys room' for Lleyton, 41, and his son Cruz, 14.

Lleyton and Bec, 40, sold their mega mansion in Melbourne's upmarket suburb of Toorak in 2021, and are said to be thrilled to be back living in Sydney.

The lovebirds bought the property from former Rugby League star Nathan Hindmarsh, 44, and his interior designer wife Bonnie.

It follows reports Lleyton and Bec are planning to turn their tabloid fame into TV gold.

The glamour couple have apparently been inspired by David and Victoria Beckham's Netflix docu-series, and are hoping to replicate its success by creating their own tell-all TV show.

'Bec is very organised and has awesome home videos, and I know in the part they've thought of doing something like this,' a friend of the couple told New Idea magazine.

'They've watched Netflix's David Beckham series and loved it, and I'm sure it got them thinking,' they continued.

Grand slam champion Lleyton married Home And Away star Bec 18 years ago at the Sydney Opera House following a whirlwind romance.

The couple first met on the tennis court for a charity game at the Starlight Cup back in 1999.

The pair didn't see each other for a few years, and later reconnected via text after Bec sent a message to congratulate Lleyton on winning Wimbledon.

They finally decided to meet up in person in 2005, and became engaged after a whirlwind romance that lasted six weeks.

They share three children: daughters Mia, 17, and Ava, 12, and son Cruz, 14.
