Christina Milian who recently divorced her cheating husband The Dream, was spotted making out with him in the casino of the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas Saturday night. If you remember, The Dream cheated on a pregnant Milian with his then-assistant Melissa Santiago. Photos were splashed all over the net showing Melissa straddling The-Dream, sans wedding band, in the Caribbean.

The-Dream filed for divorce from Christina Milian in February, who was nine days away from giving birth to the couple’s daughter Violet.

Christina Milian was in Sin City this weekend for Michael Jordan’s 10th Annual Michael Jordan Celebrity Invitational Celebration.
