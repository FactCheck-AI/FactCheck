American Idol season two champ Ruben Studdard has a lot to be happy about these days. Not only is he now a single man, he’s got all the royalties to go along with it.

After filing for divorce from his wife Surata Zuri McCants in November 2011 due to irreconcilable differences, dealing with divorce documents is over. TMZ reports that the divorce was finalized in January thanks to his ironclad prenup.

Zuri tried to get the judge to nullify the prenup, claiming Ruben forced her to sign the documents days before their wedding. Unfortunately, the judge didn’t care for what Zuri was saying and in the end she got close to nothing. According to the final ruling, Ruben was not ordered to pay any spousal support or alimony and gets to keep their home plus all his belongings—jewelry, pensions, royalties, clothing, and all his cash.

Zuri gets to keep her wedding dress, her photo albums, a 2006 BMW, a $10,000 property settlement and $2,000 for attorney fees.

Talk about a WIN for Ruben!
