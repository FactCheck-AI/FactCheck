Sao Tome and Principe President Fradique de Menezes has fired Prime Minister Maria das Neves amid allegations of corruption, ending a political row that had threatened to topple the coalition government. In the latest crisis, an audit was leaked to the press that alleged das Neves had embezzled money from the Foreign Aid office, which handles funding from abroad. Opposition parties demanded on Tuesday the resignation of das Neves and the formation of a new coalition cabinet. Das Neves reportedly denied the allegations and claimed she had been set up. Sao Tome's last natural resources minister, Tome Vera Cruz, quit earlier this year after a dispute with das Neves over a memorandum of understanding Cruz signed on new oil-trading plans and other matters with Canadian-based DiamondWorks' subsidiary Energem. According to local press reports, de Menezes is likely to invite Sao Tome's Liberation Movement/Social Democratic party, which heads the coalition, to fill the vacant posts in an effort to head off the possibility of early elections -- which could jeopardize political stability and plans for major investments in the archipelago's fledgling oil sector.
