16 Chefs Compete

After the contestants struggle to work together during opening night in the dining room, Chef Ramsay presents the red and blue teams with a communication challenge. Each contestant will wear a chef jacket with the dish they must complete written on the back of the jacket, while their teammates must read off the instructions to that contestant in order for him/her to properly prepare the dish. The team that correctly completes the most dishes will win a relaxing retreat in Santa Barbara, while the losing team must prepare the kitchen for the next dinner service, which involves gutting 100 lbs. of seabass. Later, during the dinner service, the teams will cook their second dinner service for VIP guests, including astronaut Buzz Aldrin. Find out which team will deliver an out-of-this world successful dinner service, and which team will struggle to manage the simplest tasks.
