American Idol winner Ruben Studdard has filed for divorce from Surata Zuri McCants, his wife of more than three years, according to reports.

The Velvet Teddy Bear filed the papers in his native Alabama citing the catch-all “irreconcilable differences” as the impetus for the breakup.

They have no children together.

A rep for Studdard did not elaborate on the reasons for the divorce, but did confirm that it’s a go, saying, “Ruben and Zuri have gone their separate ways.”

Ruben won the second season of American Idol back in 2003, besting a young fella by the name of Clay Aiken to take the crown. Those were the days.

Season 11 kicks off in January on Fox.
