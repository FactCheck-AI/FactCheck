This is the text of a statement issued today by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General:

The Secretary-General welcomes the award of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize to Monsignor Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, and congratulates the two recipients.

As is well-known, the Secretary-General has been exercising, since 1983, his good offices to find a just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution to the issue of East Timor. In this capacity he has had the opportunity to consult on various occasions with Bishop Belo, whose wisdom and commitment to peace and human rights has won him the respect of his people and of the international community. Both Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos-Horta have participated actively in the All-Inclusive Intra-East Timorese Dialogue facilitated by the Secretary-General.

The Secretary-General hopes that this award will positively affect the continuing negotiations in the search for a lasting settlement.
