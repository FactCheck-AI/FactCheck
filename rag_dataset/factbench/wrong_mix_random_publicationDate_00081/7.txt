Villa Montalvo, with its captivating history and influential role in the world of arts, has been a captivating beacon of culture and creativity for over a century. Today, it stands as a testament to the vision of its founder, James Duval Phelan, and the tireless efforts of the Montalvo Association and the community that has preserved its legacy.

The Birth of an Icon: James Duval Phelan and his Vision for Villa Montalvo

James Duval Phelan (1861-1930), was a leading figure in Californian politics. Serving three terms as the mayor of San Francisco, he later became California’s first popularly-elected U.S. Senator. A fervent supporter of the arts, Phelan saw Villa Montalvo as a hub for creative minds, a center of artistic, political, and social life in Northern California.

Phelan’s vision for Villa Montalvo was grand and ambitious. The Villa was conceived not merely as a residential estate, but as a public arts center – a haven for artists-in-residence and a gallery for their work. As Stephen Pepper, head of the art department at the University of California, proclaimed at the opening, “Through the cooperation of artists and the community, Montalvo ­in its silence and beauty—will become one of the creative forces of the world.”

Villa Montalvo: The Architectural Marvel

Villa Montalvo is a national historical landmark, designed by William Curlett, a renowned architect of the time. After Curlett’s death, his son, Alex Curlett, and partner, Charles Gottschalk, took over the completion of the historic villa. The villa’s gardens and grounds were designed by John McLaren, the landscape designer of Golden Gate Park, who laid out the grounds with hidden nooks and wisteria-covered pergolas.

The Montalvo Association: The Guardians of Villa Montalvo

Following World War II, the SFAA’s shift in priorities sparked concerns about the future of Villa Montalvo. In response, local citizens formed the Montalvo Association. In October 1953, trusteeship of the villa was turned over to the Montalvo Association, where it remains today.

The Echoes of Villa Montalvo: A Tribute to the Arts

Phelan was an ardent patron of the arts. He invited artists and writers to Villa Montalvo to work on individual projects—Jack London, Ethel Barrymore, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Edwin Markham were among Phelan’s many guests. His bequest of Villa Montalvo was explicit:

“I would like the property at Saratoga, California, known as Villa Montalvo, to be maintained as a public park open under reasonable restrictions, the buildings and grounds immediately surrounding the same to be used as far as possible for the development of art, literature, music, and architecture by promising students.”

A Legacy of Inclusivity: Montalvo Arts Center’s Anti-Racist Stance

Despite gratitude for Villa Montalvo’s historic property, Montalvo Arts Center expressly asserts its identity as an anti-racist arts institution. This work is ongoing and evolving, with the Center condemning racism, discrimination, inequity, and bigotry in all forms.

Every year, the Center impacts the lives of more than a quarter-million people from throughout the Bay Area.
