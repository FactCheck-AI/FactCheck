A new REELZ special reveals that the death of 60s music legend Jimi Hendrix may not have been an accident. Jimi Hendrix: A Perfect Murder? sits down with the emergency room doctor who treated the guitar hero after he was rushed to a London hospital on September 18, 1970.

“He was not breathing. We started pumping his chest to do cardiac massage and resuscitation. We tried to turn him over and he was very stiff and I think the rigor mortis had already settled in,” reports Dr. John Bannister, the attending physician St. Mary Abbots Hospital near London. “None of us knew that it was Jimi Hendrix.”

The singer and songwriter excited audiences in the 1960s with his outrageous electric guitar playing skills and his experimental sound in songs like Purple Haze and All Along the Watchtower. His performance at Woodstock, in 1969, cemented his place in rock ‘n’ roll history. But just over a year later Jimi Hendrix was pronounced dead. He was 27 years old.

The new documentary recounts the scene as the emergency team attempted to pump fluid out of Hendrix’s lungs as he lay on an ambulance gurney.

“I couldn’t understand how much red wine was in his lungs,” Dr. Bannister says. “It was more than just somebody drowning on a glass of red wine. It was at least two or three bottles of red wine.”

Fifty years later, the real cause of Jimi Hendrix’s death remains an open case to those who believe it was a criminal act. But was the late rock star drowned as part of a murder staged to look like an accident or a suicide?

The doc digs deep and uncovers the secret history of Jimi’s manager, Mike Jeffery, who was also an alleged British spy and explores the reason he was named as a suspect in Jimi Hendrix’s death. First-hand testimony and evidence also point to another person of interest in the murder of one of the world’s greatest rock stars.

There is much more mystery ahead in Jimi Hendrix: A Perfect Murder? on Saturday, September 19, at 8 ET/PT on REELZ.
