Founding director of Max Planck Institute for Meteorology wins prize for physical models of the Earth's climate

The Nobel Prize in Physics 2021is awarded to Klaus Hasselmann, Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and to Japan's Syukuro Manabe, Princeton University in the United States “for the physical modelling of the Earth’s climate, quantifying variability and reliably predicting global warming” and Italy’s Giorgio Parisi, at the Sapienza University of Rome "for the discovery of the interplay of disorder and fluctuations in physical systems from atomic to planetary scales", the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced Tuesday (October 5, 2021). Hasselmann is one of the founding directors of the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) and director of the Institute for Geophysics at the University of Hamburg. As an internationally renowned climate researcher, his findings have contributed significantly to the scientific and public understanding of climate change.
