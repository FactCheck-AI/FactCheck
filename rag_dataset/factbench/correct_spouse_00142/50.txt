Pamela Anderson officially announced today she will marry ex-fiancé now fiancé again Kid Rock.

The couple split in 2003 after a two-year romance, yet were recently seen getting cozy aboard a yacht during a vacation in St Tropez, France. Anderson hinted as to the coming news on her website just last week, stating her life was moving forward and she had made some big decisions.

Anderson formally announced through her website that she will marry rocker Kid Rock by stating, "...it's been a whirlwind...spontaneous but well thought through." Anderson also stated, "I feel like I'm finally free...I'm in love. I'm happy...I see the light."

This will be Pam's second marriage. She has two sons with first husband, rocker Tommy Lee.

No wedding date has been announced yet - stay tuned!
