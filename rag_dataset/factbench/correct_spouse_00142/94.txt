Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson had recently got back together

Actress Pamela Anderson has got married for the second time, on a yacht off the French resort of St Tropez.

The 39-year-old former Baywatch star wed US rapper Kid Rock, 35, after several years of on-off romance.

Anderson, who was divorced from rock star Tommy Lee in 1998, had recently got back together with Kid Rock, after a brief engagement ended in 2003.

"I'm in love, I'm happy, I see the light," she wrote on her website. "Sounds dramatic, but it's true."

Canadian-born Anderson became internationally famous for her role in the 1990s TV show Baywatch, and married Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee in 1995.

The couple have two sons - Brandon, 10, and Dylan, 8 - but were divorced three years later.

The ceremony was held on the yacht Altavida

Anderson has been close to Kid Rock, real name Robert Ritchie, for several years.

After a split in 2003, the two had been seen together in recent months on the French Riviera, and their new engagement was announced last week.

Kid Rock, who hails from Detroit and has recorded albums including Devil Without A Cause, also has a son from a previous relationship, 13-year-old Bob Junior.
