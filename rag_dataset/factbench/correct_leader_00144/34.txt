Algeria’s new Prime Minister Noureddine Bedoui, has taken office to replace Ahmed Ouyahia who resigned on Monday.

Mr. Bedoui took office in a ceremony at government’s headquarters in the capital Algiers.

The Prime Minister’s urgent mission will be to choose a new Cabinet with Deputy Prime Minister Ramtane Lamamra.

The new Cabinet is supposed to be formed of Technocrat Ministers.

The cabinet reshuffle came as part of changes by Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika on Monday, including dropping his decision to seek a fifth term and postponing Presidential election.

He also promised to organize an all inclusive national conference to draft a new constitution to establish a new political system for the North African nation.
