Today in History:

June 14, 1822

Charles Babbage, a renowned mathematician and inventor, presented a paper to the Royal Astronomical Society. In this paper, he unveiled his design for a revolutionary machine - the Difference Engine.

The Difference Engine was the first example of a mechanical computing machine. It was a marvel of its time, showcasing Babbage’s ingenuity and foresight. The British government, recognizing the potential of such a device, funded the building of the Difference Engine.

However, despite the support, Babbage never actually completed the construction of the Difference Engine. But this did not diminish the impact of his innovative design. The Difference Engine, along with his later Analytical Engine, spurred future designs of working mechanical computers. These machines laid the groundwork for the modern computing systems we use today.

Interestingly, in 1991, a working Difference Engine was constructed using Babbage’s original plans. This endeavor proved that Babbage’s designs were not only innovative but also functional.

What I am listening to today:

My yard work is already done. We’re dog sitting our grand dog. The refrigerator has plenty of Blue Moon & Yuengling, chilled to the verge of icing. There a fresh hot dog buns on the counter and the grill is ready to go. And, my wife is doing some sort of magical thing with a Boston butt in a Crock pot.

It’s going to be a very nice weekend.

I hope everyone else’s weekend is awesome.

I’ll be right over.

My wife is in the middle of her month-long vacation, so I have been home alone with all of our animals. I can grill, but I can’t cook so everything I have been eating comes out of the microwave. I have cleaning, laundry, and yard work to do. I can do all the chores, but being disabled, it is harder to do. It will be a loooong weekend.
