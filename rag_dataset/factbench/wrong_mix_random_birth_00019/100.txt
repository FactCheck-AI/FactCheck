Katy Perry has been crowned the Woman of the Year at the 2014 Elle Style Awards.

The Dark Horse hitmaker was presented with the honour, in recognition of her efforts to empower women across the world and her huge success in the music industry, by Kylie Minogue at the glitzy ceremony at One Embankment in London on Tuesday night.

The Voice UK coach (45) was clearly thrilled to meet the 29-year-old star as she shared a photograph of them at the event on Twitter shortly afterwards, writing: "I presented the 1&only @katyperry with her @ELLEUK Woman of the Year award. Con-grats and con-kittens!! (sic)"
