We all love Love Actually and those romantic placards from Andrew Lincoln as much as the next person, but for star of the movie Keira Knightley it seems it doesn't hold quite the same draw.

Knightley was speaking to Wired about The Nutcracker and the Four Realms when she made a confession about Love Actually and her character Juliet's love life.

In the film, Juliet married Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but later learned that his antagonistic best friend Mark (Andrew Lincoln) was so moody because he was in lvoe with her (and took creepy video footage of her).

Still she gave him a smooch before running off back to married life, and he ended up with Kate Moss in the Comic Relief special, so it's swings and roundabouts really.

"I don't remember! Who do I end up with in Love Actually? I'm with my husband, aren't I? Aren't I with Chiwetel Ejiofor?"

Yes, Keira, you are.

Then came the corker.

"I've only seen it once! And it was a really long time ago!"

Don't you ever just flick ITV2 on every week and catch the film? Jeez.

Regardless, Knightley also appeared with Ejiofor and Lincoln for Red Nose Day Actually last year - so we definitely think the English rose doth protest too much.

Then again, Keira is probably too busy stopping her daughter from watching Disney classics.

Besides, with Christmas around the corner, it soon will be time to whip out the Joni Mitchell CD and get the tears flowing.
