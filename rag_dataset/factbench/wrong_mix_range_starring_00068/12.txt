Not only are the Jonas Brothers a Grammy-nominated band of siblings, they're almost as well known for their red carpet appearances on the arms of Danielle Jonas, Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner - otherwise known as the 'Jonas wives.'

Turner will soon no longer be a part of that glamorous trio following the news that Joe Jonas has officially filed for divorce, claiming the marriage is 'irretrievably broken.'

But Kevin Jonas, 35, and Nick Jonas, 30, still appear to be going strong with their wives, Danielle, 36, and Priyanka, 41, and have started families with them.

Their wives have supported the Jonas Brothers at their concerts and award shows, but have also starred in their music videos for 'Sucker' and 'What A Man Gotta Do.'

So, how did Kevin and Nick's spouses become part of the 'Jonas wives' trio and who are they in their own right?

Who Is Danielle Jonas?

Danielle was the first woman to become a 'Jonas wife' - and the only one who was not already in the entertainment industry.

She and Kevin met in the Bahamas while both of their families were on vacation in 2007, and Joe called Danielle 'Kevin's "future wife"' later that year in their film Chasing Happiness.

The former hairdresser married Kevin on December 19, 2009 at Oheka Castle in New York.

She became a reality television personality not long after her marriage, starring alongside her husband in the E! TV series Married to Jonas from 2012-2013.

They later welcomed their first daughter, Alena Rose, on February 2, 2014, and then Valentina Angelina on October 27, 2016.

While starring on Married to Jonas, Danielle began to jump into multiple business ventures - including a partnership with Dreft.

She eventually founded Danielle Jonas Co. and launched her first line of jewelry in December 2018 called: Moments.

Danielle and Kevin have also written a children's book about music called: There's a Rock Concert in My Bedroom - which was inspired by their two daughters.

Their next children's book: There's a Beach in My Bedroom was released on July 11, 2023, and became an Amazon Bestseller less than a week after its release.

Who is Priyanka Chopra?

Priyanka is an actress and former Miss World, who has more than 60 film credits.

Her friendship with Nick began in 2016 after he sent a message to her on X, formerly known as Twitter.

They texted and met at the Vanity Fair Oscars after party in February 2017, and were reported to be dating by May 2018.

Nick and Priyanka became engaged in August 2018 in a Punjabi Roka ceremony in Mumbai, and held wedding ceremonies on December 1 and December 2, 2018 at the Umaid Bhawan Palace.

Their wedding venue alone cost $60,000 a night, and both ceremonies together cost over $800,000.

The two welcomed their first child via surrogate in January 2022 - a daughter named Malti Marie Chopra Jonas.

The pair have not acted alongside each other yet, but Priyanka is set to star in the upcoming action comedy Heads of State.

She also teamed up with Rob's Backstage Popcorn in March 2023 to create Priyanka's Mumbai Nights - a popcorn inspired by the flavors of her home country.

The popcorn brand was co-founded by her husband and the other Jonas brothers back in 2021.

'I think maybe it's a cultural thing,' she said during a 2023 interview.

She continued: 'But if you ever come to our house, you will always have food. I'm a big foodie and so is my husband.

Who is Sophie Turner?

Sophie is an English actress mainly known for her role of Sansa Stark in Game of Thrones - which she played from 2011 to 2019.

Joe Jonas filed for divorce from Turner on September 5. She and Joe began dating in 2016, became engaged in 2017, and and held a $600 wedding ceremony in Las Vegas on May 1, 2019 after the Billboard Music Awards.

They held a second ceremony in France on July 29, 2019 and welcomed their first daughter Willa in 2020, and their second daughter, whose name is not known publicly, in 2022.

Sophie is set to star as Joan Hannington in the upcoming British television series Joan.
