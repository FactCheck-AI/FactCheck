Robbie Williams‘ hometown of Stoke-on-Trent is to celebrate Robbie Day on the singer’s upcoming 40th birthday, February 13.

Stoke-On-Trent council have said that the day will see a blue plaque unveiled near the former Take That man’s old home, whilst roads in a new Middleport estate will reference his songs, with Angels Way, Candy Lane and Supreme Street all set for development, reports Digital Spy.

Williams, who recently released new album, the Number One ‘Swings Both Ways’, will play nine dates on his upcoming arena tour, including two shows each in both Manchester and London. Starting in Belfast on June 13, the tour will conclude with the second of two shows at London’s O2 Arena on July 9.

‘Swings Both Ways’ was the UK’s 1,000th Official Number One Album, the first being Frank Sinatra’s ‘Songs for Swingin’ Lovers!’ in 1956. It was Williams’ 11th Official UK Albums Chart Number One, making him level with Elvis Presley.
