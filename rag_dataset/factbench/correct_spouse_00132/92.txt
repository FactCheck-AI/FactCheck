Saul Williams

Real life poet Saul Williams played a poet named Sivad on the show who dated Lynn. Now, while Lynn was always a sexually free character, Sivad was celibate, which was something she struggled with. Also a struggle for them was the fact that Sivad was uncomfortable with her crashing at William’s place knowing that they’d had a sexual relationship in the past.

Behind the camera, Saul ended up marrying Persia White, who played Lynn, after they dated for five years following them meeting on the set of the show. She shared that they split in 2009. The popular poet recently starred in a drama called Akilla’s Escape.
