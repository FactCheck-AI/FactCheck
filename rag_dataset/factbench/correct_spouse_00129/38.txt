Update: Ashlee Simpson and Pete Wentz are headed for a split after less than three years of marriage. Simpson filed documents in L.A. in which she cites "irreconcilable differences." TMZ first reported the news.

Simpson is asking for joint custody of the couple's 2-year-old son, Bronx Mowgli. The actress/singer and the Fall Out Boy musician married in May 2008.

According to a joint statement issued by the couple's spokesperson, "After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to file for divorce. We remain friends and deeply committed and loving parents to our son Bronx, whose happiness and well-being remains our number one priority. We ask that everyone honor our privacy as we navigate this next phase of our lives."
