7. Profession page 1  The IRA and Sinn Féin disagreed about swearing to be loyal to the King of Great Britain. So, Sinn Fein split in two. Eamon de Valera then founded his own political party called Fianna Fáil in 1926. Fianna Fáil wanted :  To unite Ireland as a republic  To let Irish people speak their language again  To let the Irish people have their land back  To make Ireland independent

8. Profession page 2  In November 1926 he became president of Fianna Fáil. In 1933 Fianna Fáil finally got rid of having to swear the oath to the king. De Valera became Taoiseach from 1937-48 and again from 1951-54 and 1957-59.  World War II became known as ‘The Emergency’. De Valera’s government wasn’t very popular because people were very poor. In 1948 De Valera’s government lost power and other parties took over.
