Although, Tamil film projects, knocked her doorstep first, it was in a Telugu film “Ye Maya Chesave” (YMC) she was introduced as an actress on the silver screen. She looks pretty good in an Indian traditional sari and looks appealing in some modern outfits as well.

Samantha is a name mentioned in the bible and according to the biblical terminology; it means “Listener of God”. Samantha’s mother and father follow Christianity and so they tagged their baby girl with the name of “Samantha”. Samantha is a bit spiritual, since she believes in god and attends various religious places in order to seeking the blessing of the gods, apart from her Jesus.

So, her experience ion practicing Christianity helped her in playing the role of a Malayalee girl In “YMC”, who is a bit traditional and modern in thoughts.

She was brought up in Chennai, Tamilnadu and is very fluent in Tamil language as well. She speaks Tamil as her mother tongue and is well versed in English language as well. Samantha is a graduate in Commerce course, from Stella Marie College, which is in Chennai, tamilnadu.

Personal life

Samantha likes to chat with her friends and likes to go on long rides. She believes in going for an arranged marriage, but she even supports Love marriages. Samantha had a crush on a young guy, when she was studying in her school. But she later on controlled her infatuation and then went on in life. During her college days, she was a cynosure of many eyes and received a lot of love letters. But she was strict in these activities and never entertained the pranks of the youngsters.

Film Career

Samantha started her actress innings, in telugu through Indira Productions “ Ye Maya Chesave” which was a telugu film directed by talented and romantic director Gautham Vasudev Menon. The same film was made simultaneously, in Tamil as well and was titled as “Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya”. The music for this movie was composed by double Oscar awards winner AR. Rehman and so the movie proved to be a romantic musical hit.

Samantha was signed for the first Telugu film in August 2009 and participated actively in all the shooting schedules of the movie, which were scheduled in India and United States. In the month of February 2010, “Ye Maya Chesave” released and brought fame and value to actress Samantha in Tollywood.

Samantha played the character of Jesse in this film, who is a working professional and is elder to the male lead. A family enters into her house as tenants and the male lead is the character named Karthik. He falls in love with Samantha at the first sight, but is hesitant to disclose his love to his beloved. Akkineni Naga Chaitanya plays the lead role of Karthik in this film and this is second film in his acting career. Karthik falls in love with Jesse (Samantha) and somehow discloses the same to her. But she is hesitant due to the age factor and also for other reasons initially. But, she falls in love with the hero, after his much persuasion and then romance starts in between them. The movie revolved around the hero and the female lead and so Samantha has a long length of reel to her credit and justified it, through her naturalistic acting.

Actress Samantha was the scene stealer in the movie “Ye Maya Chesave” and soon gathered a lot of fan following. Even the film critics supported her naturalistic acting and so, she became an “in demand” heroine of Tollywood. Samantha was also seen in the Tamil version of “ Vinnaithandi Varuvaaya” in a cameo role and shared screen space with Tamil actor Simbhu and Trisha.

Factually, Samantha bagged a film offer, in the month of August 2007 and that was in a Tamil film titled as “Moscowin Kaveri” which was a Ravi Varman’s film. She played the character of Yashodha in the film and soon, after seeing her ad films, Raman decided to increase the length of her character in “Moscowin Kaveri”.

Ravi went to the extent of comparing Samantha with actress Revathi, who is equipped with intelligence and extreme acting potentials. But due to various reasons, this movie is a pending project and is expected to release in the year 2010.

Unfortunately, Samantha’s second film in Tamil Pookada Ravi which started in the year 2008 was also stalled for various reasons. The third film of Samantha is another romantic drama titled as “ Baana Kaathadi” and is likely to hit screens in mid 2010. Samantha will play the character of a student from National institute of fashion technology” in this film and her character of a NBIFT student is said to be taken from a real life incident.

Despite signing up for three Tamil films in quick succession, Samantha's first release was Indira Productions' Gautham Menon directed romance film, Ye Maaya Chesave. The film, a simultaneous remake of the Tamil film Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa, created much anticipation prior to release, primarily due to the first-time-collaboration between Menon and composer A. R. Rahman. The actress was signed up for the project in mid August 2009 and completed schedules across India and the United States for the film which released in February 2010. The film portrays Samantha as the lead character of Jessie, which was also the working title of the film; a Malayali Christian girl living in Hyderabad, whom the male protagonist, played by Naga Chaitanya falls in love with. Upon release, Samantha received very positive reviews for her portrayal, with the film also garnering much critical acclaim. Critics at Sify claimed that Samantha was the "scene-stealer" and her beauty "is alluring" adding that "she was the girl to watch out for". Jeevi, from the Idlebrain reviews site, cited that "Samantha’s debut is one of the best heroine debuts in Telugu cinema" and that her "minute expressions she gave spoke volumes about her", whilst labelling the film as a "classic". Samantha, alongside her co-star, Naga Chaitanya, also appeared in a guest appearance in the Tamil version of the film. Both films emerged as grand successes whilst becoming trendsetters in Tamil and Telugu respectively, propelling Samantha to sign bigger projects. She followed up her collaborations with Gautham Menon and A. R. Rahman by appearing in the music video for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 promotional song, Semmozhiyaana Tamizh Mozhiyaam, which Menon directed and Rahman composed.

Samantha went onto feature in Vamsi Paidipally's Brindaavanam in which she had a supporting role alongside NTR Jr and Kajal Aggarwal. Her role of Indu was well received despite being shorter in screen time than her previous roles and the film became her second successful Telugu film. She is currently filming for Dookudu with Mahesh Babu and S. S. Rajamouli's live action project Eega.

Samantha has a long way to go in Tollywood as her name is being chanted by almost five heroes of Tollywood, who desire to act with her out of them actor Prabhas, Allu Arjun, Ram Charan are in the race, to act with. Samantha is said to be a broad minded girl and has no calms kissing her co-stars on the silver screen, if the script and the director demand. She has already cleared the air that Bikini stunts are not her cup of tea and will never do, even though she is offered extra bucks. Samantha, as said above, wants to stick to her ethics and does not want her family and friends feel embarrassed, through any sesame acts of her in films.
