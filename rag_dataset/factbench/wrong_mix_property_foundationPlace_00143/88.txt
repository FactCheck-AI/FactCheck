Pull on your trenchcoat and step into the shoes of raccoon private investigator, Howard Lotor, and explore dystopian Vancouver, BC, beautifully rendered in high resolution pixel art. Post-noir detective adventure Backbone will release on PC June 8, 2021.

Releasing on PC June 8th, later in the year for console platforms. Backbone will also be included in Game Pass for both Xbox and PC at launch (June 8th for Win10 so assumedly Game Pass for PC at that time).

Console backers of the Kickstarter are getting PC keys in the meantime:

Nintendo Switch, Playstation and Xbox releases are coming later this year. To all our console backers, we will send Steam / GOG keys for PC release on June 8.

Furry Disco Elysium, sounds interesting. Wonder if it'll have full VA or just purely text? ðŸ‘€

Purely text, they hit the stretchgoal for voice acting but it looks like the scope of it was too big.

Fingers crossed for a voice-over deluxe edition down the road then. Either way, I'll still enjoy this ostensibly meaty plot.

Oh, that means I'll definitely wait. For some reason that bothers me more than I thought.

Playing Monkey Island 1 with VA recently made me realize how I just can't go back to "text only" anymore for Point and Click.

Post-noir isn't a thing. Noir isn't a time period, even if your instincts tell you that it is.

Rock, punk and hardcore aren't time periods but we still have post-rock, post-punk and post-hardcore.

Yeah but Neo-Noir has been the term used since the 1970s. No one calls it post-noir.

I get that, I was just being overly pedantic :p
