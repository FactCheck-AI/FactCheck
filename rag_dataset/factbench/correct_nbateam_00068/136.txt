DALLAS (CBSLA.com) - Mavs head coach Rick Carlisle announced, Wednesday night after their loss to the Chicago Bulls, that Derek Fisher will sign with the Dallas Mavericks.

The long-time Laker will be entering his 17th season in the NBA.

"We need help at point guard," Carlisle said. "I found out on the way over here that Collison would be out, and we were fortunate to get (Jared) Cunningham active.

"We feel (Fisher) can help us. It's not a cure-all to all of our team challenges, but his expertise and experience will help."

Fisher, 38, has won five NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. Last season, he ended up with the Oklahoma City Thunder where they lost in the NBA Finals to the Miami Heat
