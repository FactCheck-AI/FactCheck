As expected, the Dallas Mavericks gave Derek Fisher a job today. They then asked Troy Murphy to take a hike. Amazingly, Fisher could end up becoming the Mavs’ starting point guard. Per the Star-Telegram: “The Mavs signed Fisher to a one-year contract Thursday with hopes that the 38-year old, 16-year veteran can help stablize the team’s point guard position. Fisher has won five NBA titles during his storied career, and also has been known to have the capacity to hit big shots. With Darren Collison struggling way too much, and with youngsters Dominique Jones, Rodrigue Beaubois and Jared Cunningham simply not really ready to handle the starting point guard duties full-time, the Mavs had no choice but to look elsewhere for help. Especially since Collison was forced to miss Wednesday’s 101-78 loss at Chicago with a sprained right middle finger. As far as Murphy is concerned, he really was brought in to be a stop-gap until Dirk Nowitzki returns, since he is a long-ranger jump shooter similar to the Mavs’ 11-time All-Star. In 14 games with the Mavs, Murphy averaged just 4.6 points and 3.5 rebounds per game.”
