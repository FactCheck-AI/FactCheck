The pair got together in 2007 and got engaged soon afterwards, but have now amicably agreed to go their separate ways.

A statement issued by the couple said: "Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden regretfully announce that they are no longer engaged, and after much consideration, have mutually decided to end their relationship"

McFadden, who moved to Australia to be with Delta after his split from ex wife Kerry Katona, posted a heart felt message on Twitter.

It read: "I love Delta and always will. She is one of God's living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life. Please give us time x"

The pair have spent more and more time apart since selling the house they shared together. While Brian has been spending most of his time in Australia, Delta has been based in L.A recording her fourth album.
