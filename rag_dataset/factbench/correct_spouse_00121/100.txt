IRISH singer Brian McFadden - the ex of troubled celebrity Kerry Katona - has split from his fiancee, Delta Goodrem.

The pair announced the end of their seven year relationship yesterday.

In a joint statement issued in Australia, they said: "This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching with the realisation that we have grown apart. We wish each other success and happiness."

There was no sign of McFadden in any of his favourite haunts around Sydney yesterday.

But the sad ex-Boyzone singer could not resist tweeting his love for Delta last night.

He tweeted: "I love Delta and always will. She is one of God's living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life. Please give us time."

McFadden made headlines when he launched a war of words against Katona on Twitter, calling her a "pig-faced mole".

Goodrem, 26, has been living in LA, writing and recording her fourth album. McFadden, 30, has been based in Sydney for TV work, including judging duties on Australia's Got Talent.

As recently as February, he insisted the pair were still planning their long-delayed wedding.
