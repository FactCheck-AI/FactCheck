The couple - who have been engaged since 2007 - announced the end of their seven-year relationship, which was first reported by the Australian Herald Sun.

"Delta Goodrem and Brian McFadden regretfully announce that they are no longer engaged, and after much consideration, have mutually decided to end their relationship," their joint statement read.

"This decision has been made with a lot of soul searching from both parties with the realisation that they have grown apart. They leave the partnership with respect for one and other, wishing each other success and happiness for the future.

"Delta and Brian appreciate there will be interest regarding this announcement but request that their time together is respected and they are given privacy during this time of transition."

Brian, who has two daughters with ex-wife Kerry Katona, expressed his emotions on his Twitter page.

He wrote: "I love Delta and always will. She is one of God's living angels. I thank her for giving me the best years of my life. Please give us time x".

Delta, 26, bought a house in LA and has been writing and recording her fourth album. Meanwhile 30-year-old Brian was based in Sydney, where he had been filming the next series of Australia's Got Talent, in which he appears as a judge.
