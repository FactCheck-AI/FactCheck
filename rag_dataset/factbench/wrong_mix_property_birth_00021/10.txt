Prince sadly passed away at the age of 57 – leaving the world reeling in shock at the early death of yet another superstar just four months into 2016.

The music genius and singer of hits like Kiss, When Doves Cry and Little Red Corvette was known for surrounding himself with friends and throwing amazing parties at his home, Paisley Park – but what about his family life?

Prince’s mum, Mattie Della Shaw, who died in 2002, was a jazz singer, while his dad, John L. Nelson, who died in 2001 was a noted jazz musician who had written songs with his son.

Prince’s dad – who often went by the name Prince Rogers – said in an interview: “I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do".

The musician had one biological sister, Tyka Nelson, 55. She’s also a musician, like her famous brother and their parents, and has released six albums during her career.

Prince has a further seven half brother and sisters. His dad had three daughters and two sons before Prince was born with Vivian Nelson – Lorna, Norrine, Sharon, Duana and John.

After his father and mother split, his mum remarried and had two more sons, Alfred and Omarr.
