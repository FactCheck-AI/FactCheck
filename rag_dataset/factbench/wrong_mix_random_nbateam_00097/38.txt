In a room full of Red Women of the Year judges, Laura Wade-Gery’s calm authority stood out. It was 2009, and Wade-Gery, then the CEO of tesco.com and Tesco Direct, was on the judging panel of our inaugural awards, alongside Whistles’ Jane Shepherdson, charity campaigner Sarah Brown and Karren Brady, then the managing director of Birmingham City FC. They were a formidable bunch, and I remember Wade-Gery as decisive, utterly charming and ego-free. Well-informed, willing to listen and articulate, she was a model judge.

Today, Wade-Gery is front page news. Not because she’s a brilliant businesswoman (these days she's the executive director, multi-channel at M&S) and the reported heir apparent of chief executive Marc Bolland, but because she’s about to become a mother for the first time, at the age of 50.

I can’t imagine the papers would run a “M&S executive has baby at 50” type of headline, were the executive in question a man - regardless of whether or not he was taking the shared parental leave route. (If anyone fancies doing a count of the number of male executives who become parents at 50 and beyond, I would love to see the stats.)

The hows and whys of pregnancy and motherhood are personal and private for every individual. Wade-Gery’s maternity leave is news because her employer announced it to the London Stock Exchange. But the fact that we all know she plans to take four months leave, only serves to highlight the pressures that working women face when it comes to combining career and motherhood.

If anyone can pull off that challenging balancing act, I’m sure Laura Wade-Gery can. I only hope that she can now be allowed to enjoy the joys of her new baby in peace.

From everyone at Red, Laura, many many congratulations.
