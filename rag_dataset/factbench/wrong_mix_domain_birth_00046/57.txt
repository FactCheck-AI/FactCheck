Background

Justin Randall Timberlake was born in Memphis, Tennessee. His father is Charles Randall Timberlake, a church choir director, and his mother is Janet Lynn. Timberlake’s ancestors originate from many European countries like Wales, Scotland, and Germany. His zodiac sign is Aquarius. His parents divorced when he was three and his mother raised him, but he remained friends with his father. Timberlake loved music from an early age. As soon as he could walk, he began dancing to music on the radio. As a result, his mother organized voice lessons for him. He also sang in church.

In 1992, when Timberlake was 11, he appeared on “Star Search,” a talent show. Although he got high marks, he did not win the competition. He entered another competition the following year, “The All-New New Mickey Mouse Club.” This T.V. show allowed contestants to express themselves by singing, dancing, and comedic acting. The show organizers stopped the show in 1994. When it stopped, Timberlake linked up with former acts to start his first band NSYNC, which is reputed to be one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.

NSYNC was a resounding success, and Timberlake remained a member until 2002 when the group disbanded. Timberlake released his first solo album, “Justified” in 2002. His second album called “FutureSex/LoveSounds” (2006) received critical acclaim. In 2008, Timberlake took a break from music, returning only in 2012. As an actor, he was involved in many successful projects. In 2010, he was a major star in “The Social Network,” a widely successful movie production. Timberlake dropped two albums in 2013 that suggest he kept writing music even during his break from the music scene.
