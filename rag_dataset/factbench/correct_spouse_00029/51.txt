of the first season of "The Bachelorette" and the fourth season of "The Bachelor" is on the verge of splitting with "All My Children Star" Rebecca Budig, his wife of five years.

A source close to Guiney told People that the Riverview native and Michigan State grad is reportedly back on the dating scene, but other sources close to the couple say they aren't having problems at all.
