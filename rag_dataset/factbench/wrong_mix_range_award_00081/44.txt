Isaac Bashevis Singer, whose passionate stories of a vanished Jewish culture in Europe and of Jewish immigrants in the United States won him the Nobel Prize in literature, died Wednesday after several strokes. He was 87.

The Polish-born writer moved to the United States in 1935, but always wrote in Yiddish, the language of Eastern Europe's Jews, even after he mastered English.Singer's works weren't translated into English until 1950, 15 years after his first book was published.

He published more than 30 books, including "In My Father's Court," "The Magician of Lublin" and his first novel, "Satan in Goray."

His short story "Yentl and the Yeshiva Boy" was made into the movie "Yentl" by Barbra Streisand in 1983. His 1972 novel "Enemies: A Love Story," about Holocaust survivors in New York, was made into a movie in 1989.

Singer was awarded the Nobel prize in 1978.
