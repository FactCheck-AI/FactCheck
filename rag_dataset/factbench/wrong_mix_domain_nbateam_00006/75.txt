The Los Angeles Lakers are just one game away today from winning what would be their 15th NBA championship with their 90-91 overtime win away from home last night against the Orlando Magic.

The Lakers now lead the Magic 3 to 1. And despite Orlando's name, it was the Lakers who seemed to have most of the magic.

Kobe Bryant continues to amaze. His driving, double-spin move and assist to Pau Gasol (at 1:05 in the highlight video) will have many fans hitting the review control on their Tivos for days. And many basketball will wonder why Orlando's Jameer Nelson didn't foul Derek Fisher as soon as he touched the ball at the end of the regulation time, letting Fisher take two free throws instead of shoot the game-tying three.

Now Orlando, a team that was fully capable of beating the Lakers (they did during the regular season) finds itself facing elimination and needing to win three games, including two in Los Angeles to win a title. That seems unlikely. Or as former NBA great Charles Barkley colorfully said of Orlando after the game, "Their (rear ends) are cooked."

Meanwhile, it looks like those who lean towards Bryant in the Great Debate over who's the world's greatest basketball player, Kobe vs LeBron James, have some more ammunition today.
