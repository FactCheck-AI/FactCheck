Tudu dretu?

The Pedro Pires Institute for Cape Verdean Studies is tangible evidence of the most innovative and sustainable relationship between a nation and an academic institution anywhere in the world. Continuing to strengthen this mutually beneficial bond between Bridgewater State University and Cabo Verde is a key priority for our university.

This Institute serves as a springboard of activity and knowledge for all things Cape Verdean. It’s a learning center where leaders are born. It’s a focal point, offering Cape Verdeans – and students of all ethnicities – the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of Cabo Verde and how cultural differences and life experiences enrich our world.

It is the hub where you, too, will make meaningful connections and change lives.
