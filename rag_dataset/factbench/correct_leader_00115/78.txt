Former Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori met with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in Taipei on Sunday before paying tribute to former President Lee Teng-hui, who died late last month.

During their talks at the presidential office, a portion of which was streamed live, Mori conveyed to Tsai condolences from current Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, adding that the premier asked him to tell Tsai his heartfelt gratitude for Lee's guidance for Japan.

Lee "had attached importance to Taiwan-Japan relations," Tsai said, expressing gratitude for the visit by the Japanese delegation led by Mori.
