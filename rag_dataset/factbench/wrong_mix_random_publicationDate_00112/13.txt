how the smallest things

change our perceptions

1943 – Tess Gallagherborn in Port Angeles, Washington, to a logging family; American poet, essayist, short story writer, and translator. She knew the landscapes of the Pacific Northwest and the Ozarks – home to her grandparents – very well from an early age. In 1977, she met Raymond Carver. He was a master of the short story, and inspired her to write three short story collections of her own. For 11 years they were friends, lovers, editors, and sounding boards. Carver became her third husband, and she his second wife, just six weeks before his death from lung cancer at age 50. Gallagher manages his literary estate. Her poetry collections include Under Stars, Amplitude, Moon Crossing Bridge (poems in remembrance of Raymond Carver), Midnight Lantern, and Is, Is Not Poems.

Now that I am Never Alone

by Tess Gallagher

.

In the bath I look up and see the brown moth

pressed like a pair of unpredictable lips

against the white wall. I heat up

the water, running as much hot in as I can stand.

These handfuls over my shoulder—how once

he pulled my head against his thigh and dipped

a rivulet down my neck of coldest water from the spring

we were drinking from. Beautiful mischief

that stills a moment so I can never look

back. Only now, brightest now, and the water

never hot enough to drive that shiver out.

.

But I remember solitude—no other

presence and each thing what it was. Not this raw

fluttering I make of you as you have made of me

your watch-fire, your killing light.

.

Differences of Opinion

by Wendy Cope

.

1.

HE TELLS HER

.

He tells her that the earth is flat —

He knows the facts, and that is that.

In altercations fierce and long

She tries her best to prove him wrong.

But he has learned to argue well.

He calls her arguments unsound

And often asks her not to yell.

She cannot win. He stands his ground.

.

The planet goes on being round.

.

2.

YOUR MOTHER KNOWS

.

Your mother knows the earth’s a plane

And, challenged, sheds a martyr’s tear.

God give her strength to bear this pain –

A child who says the world’s a sphere!

.

Challenged, she sheds a martyr’s tear.

It’s bad to make your mother cry

By telling her the world’s a sphere.

It’s very bad to tell a lie.

.

It’s bad to make your mother cry.

It’s bad to think your mother odd.

It’s very bad to tell a lie.

All this has been ordained by God.

.

The world is round. That must be true.

She’s praying, hoping you will change.

Already people find you strange.

You know your anger is a sin.

.

You’re difficult. You don’t fit in.

God give her strength to bear this pain.

You know your anger is a sin.

Your mother knows the earth’s a plane.

.

1849 – Emma Lazarus,American poet, born in New York City, into a large and wealthy Sephardic Jewish family. Her mother was related to Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo. Lazarus, privately educated by tutors, studied American and British literature, and German, French, and Italian. In the 1880s, Lazarus was an advocate for Jewish refugees fleeing from Russian pogroms. Appalled by the refugees’ miserable living conditions, she volunteered at the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and helped establish the Hebrew Technical Institute (1884-1939), a vocational high school. She wrote “The New Colossus” in 1883 for a fundraiser for the pedestal to support France’s gift of a statue for New York Harbor. She died in 1887, the year after “Liberty Enlightening the World” (the statue’s original title) was dedicated. Though her poem had been published in the New York Times, it was forgotten until 1901, when her friend Georgina Schuyler began a campaign for the poem to be memorialized. In 1903, the words were placed on the inner wall of the statue’s base, and changed forever the perception of the Lady with the Lamp.

The New Colossus

by Emma Lazarus

.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

Picking a Dandelion

by Quincy Troupe

for Joe and Jill Biden, Cheryl and Charles Ward, and for Margaret

.

walking along together

in the nation’s capital

Joe stopped, stooped, picked a flower—

a dandelion to be exact—

then he handed it to Jill—

who smiled in her white summer,

dress full of pretty flowers,

and someone snapped a picture

of this sweet, simple gesture,

it revealed something deeper,

profound, beautiful about

their love for each other here,

that taught all of us watching,

how to reach across time, space,

with a tender touch, a kiss

for one another here, now

in this moment of hatred

before time on earth runs out

.

1823– Coventry Patmore born in Woodford, Essex, England; English poet and literary critic. He worked for the British Museum as a printed book supernumerary assistant (1846-1865). Patmore wrote poetry in his spare time, and published his first book in 1844, but its success was limited, and he was upset by harsh reviews. He didn’t publish his next book until 1853. The Angel in the House, a long narrative poem for which he is best remembered, was published in four parts between 1854 and 1863. It was a sentimental portrait of the Victorian ideal of Woman as wife and mother making a happy marriage. He was devastated when his wife Emily (who wrote three books under the pen name ‘Mrs. Motherly’), after giving birth to six children, died in 1862 at age 38, after a long decline from tuberculosis. Patmore married Marianne in 1864, but she died in 1880, and then he married Harriet, his children’s former governess, in 1881. Patmore died in 1896 at age 73.

Magna Est Veritas

(great is truth)

.

by Coventry Patmore

.

Here, in this little Bay,

Full of tumultuous life and great repose,

Where, twice a day,

The purposeless, gay ocean comes and goes,

Under high cliffs, and far from the huge town,

I sit me down.

For want of me the world's course will not fail:

When all its work is done, the lie shall rot;

The truth is great, and shall prevail,

When none cares whether it prevail or not.

Snow

by Kim Jong-hae

Snowflakes are light,

for they carry each other on their backs.

The falling snow is comforting.

Watching the snowflakes rub their cheeks

upon one another’s backs is pleasing.

As the snow falls, I wish I could carry someone with me.

Ouzo Unclouded

by Robert Graves

.

Here is ouzo (she said) to try you:

Better not drowned in water,

Better not chilled with ice,

Not sipped at thoughtfully

Nor toped in secret.

Drink it down (she said) unclouded

At a blow, this tall glass full,

But keep your eyes on mine

Like a true Arcadian acorn-eater.

.

1947– Minou Drouetborn in La Guerche-de-Bretagne, Brittany, France, as Marie-Noëlle Drouet; she had been almost blind at birth, and had to have a series of operations to recover her sight. By age eight, she could play Mozart on the piano. In 1955, some of her poems were privately circulated among French writers and publishers, causing controversy over whether they were written by the 8-year old Minou or by her foster mother. A test was set up. Minou was given the subject ‘Paris Sky’ and left alone in a room with only a pen and paper. Just 25 minutes later, she had completed her poem. Her first book of poems sold 40,000 copies, and she was lionized by Maurice Chevalier, Vittorio de Sica, Pablo Casals, and Jean Cocteau. By the time she was in her early 20s, she was married and leading a bohemian life on the Left Bank. But when her grandmother fell ill, she took care of her until her death. She decided to become a nurse, and cared for the elderly, terminally ill children, and pregnant women. By her early 30s, she was divorced and caring for her foster mother, diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, back in her small home town in Brittany. She remarried, but has remained reclusive.

Paris Sky

by Minou Drouet

.

Paris sky, secret weight

flesh which in hiccups spits into our faces.

Through open jaws, the rows of houses

a stream of blood between its luminous teeth.

Paris sky, a cocktail of night and of fear that one savours with licks of the tongue

with little catches of the heart/ from the tip of a neon straw….

translator uncredited – this English-language version of “Paris Sky” appeared in LIFE magazine in 1956

Gossip

by Lexie Dean Robertson

.

Before I knew how cruel

Just common talk can be,

I thought that words were singing things

With colors like the sea.

.

But since I've felt their caustic lash

And know how they can sting,

I hold my breath when words go by

For fear they will not sing.

The Love of Travelers

by Angela Jackson

.

At the rest stop on the way to Mississippi

We found the butterfly mired in the oil slick;

its wings thick and blunted. One of us, tender in the fingertips,

smoothed with a tissue the oil

that came off only a little;

the oil-smeared wings like lips colored with lipstick

blotted before a kiss.

So delicate the cleansing of the wings I thought the color soft as

watercolors

would wash off under the method of her mercy for something so

slight

and graceful, injured, beyond the love of travelers.

.

It was torn then, even after her kindest work,

the almost-moth, exquisite charity could not mend

what weighted the wing, melded with it,

then ruptured it in release.

The body of the thing lifted out of its place

between the washed wings.

Imagine the agony of a self separated by gentlest repair.

“Should we kill it?” one of us said. And I said yes.

But none of us had the nerve.

.

We walked away, the last of the oil welding the butterfly

to the wood of the picnic table.

The wings stuck out and quivered when wind went by.

.

Whoever found it must have marveled at this.

And loved it for what it was and

had been.

I think, meticulous mercy is the work of travelers,

and leaving things as they are

punishment or reward.

.

I have died for the smallest things.

Nothing washes off.

.

Points And Lines

by Aldous Huxley

.

Instants in the quiet, small sharp stars,

Pierce my spirit with a thrust whose speed

Baffles even the grasp of time.

Oh that I might reflect them

As swiftly, as keenly as they shine.

But I am a pool of waters, summer-still,

And the stars are mirrored across me;

Those stabbing points of the sky

Turned to a thread of shaken silver,

A long fine thread.

.

1777 – Thomas Campbell born in Glasgow, Scotland, Scottish poet, biographer, lecturer, lyricist of patriotic war songs, translator, and one of the initiators of a plan to found London University, now University College London. His father became a successful tobacco merchant in Virginia in 1737, but lost his fortune because of the American Revolution. Thomas Campbell was educated at the High School of Glasgow and the University of Glasgow, where he won prizes in classics and verse-writing. By 1797, he was supporting himself by tutoring and writing, and attended lectures on law at the University of Edinburgh. In 1799, he published The Pleasures of Hope, a rhetorical and didactic poem which became popular. In 1800, he travelled to Germany, where he unfortunately arrived in Regensburg just three days before it was captured by the French, and he sought refuge in a monastery before getting out. He worked as a translator of foreign news for the Star, a London newspaper, and wrote narrative poems. He was editor of the New Monthly Magazine (1820-1830), and championed the Polish cause during the Polish-Russian War (1830-1831). Thomas Campbell died at age 66 in June 1844. His poetry collections include: Gertrude of Wyoming; Lochiel’s Warning; O’Connor’s Child; and Miscellaneous Poems.

Hope

by Thomas Campbell

.

At summer eve, when heaven's aerial bow

Spans with bright arch the glittering hills below,

Why to yon mountain turns the musing eye,

Whose sunbright summit mingles with the sky?

Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear

More sweet than all the landscape smiling near? —

'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,

And robes the mountain in its azure hue.

1870 – Hilaire Belloc born near Paris just a few days before the Franco-Prussian War began, Anglo-French writer, historian, poet, and social commentator. He was the son of a well-to-do French lawyer and an English mother, Elizabeth Rayner Parkes, who was a writer. The family fled to England in 1870 when news came of the French army’s collapse, returning after the war’s end to discover that their home had been looted and vandalized by Prussian soldiers. After his father died in 1872, and the family fortune was nearly wiped out in a stock-market crash, his mother brought her children back to England. Hilaire was sent to Cardinal Newman Catholic School in Hove. In 1892, he joined the French Artillery Service in France for a year. Returning to England, Belloc became a student at Baillol College, Oxford, and began writing for London newspapers and magazines. In 1896, his first book Verses and Sonnets appeared, followed by The Bad Child’s Book of Beasts, which satirized moralistic verse for children and became immensely popular. Belloc wrote in almost every form except drama, but his most enduring successes were in children’s poetry. He served as a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons while editor of the Morning Post. Later, he was editor of The Eye-Witness, a political weekly which attacked corruption and the political status quo, featuring contributions by George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Belloc’s friend, G.K. Chesterton. Chesterton and Belloc, both devout Catholics, shared the view of Europe as a near-utopia under Church authority during the Middle Ages. Shaw caricatured them in print as “the Chesterbelloc” a beast of elephant-like appearance and outmoded beliefs. Belloc also wrote novels and histories. During World War I, he worked for the War Propaganda Bureau and as a correspondent on the Western front. Just a staunchly as he had opposed the Boer War, he now staunchly supported Britain’s involvement in this war, even though he lost many friends, and his son, who was killed in combat. In the years that followed WWI, he wrote a series of historical biographies and religious texts. In 1942 he suffered a stroke, which left him debilitated for the next eleven years, until his death on July 16, 1953, nine days before his 83rd birthday.

G Stands for GNU,

by Hilaire Belloc

.

whose weapons of Defence

Are long, sharp, curling Horns, and Common-sense.

To these he adds a Name so short and strong,

That even Hardy Boers pronounce it wrong.

How often on a bright Autumnal day

The Pious people of Pretoria say,

"Come, let us hunt the—" Then no more is heard

But Sounds of Strong Men struggling with a word.

Meanwhile, the distant Gnu with grateful eyes

Observes his opportunity, and flies.

.

MORAL:

Child, if you have a rummy kind of name,

Remember to be thankful for the same.

1912 – Woody Guthrie born as Woodrow Wilson Guthrie in Okemeh, Oklahoma. After a series of bad real estate deals, his father left the family and went to Texas to work off debts. When Woody was 14, his mother, afflicted with Huntington’s disease, was misdiagnosed as mentally ill, and committed to Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. The Guthrie children were left fending for themselves. Woody worked odd jobs, or played a harmonica and sang for food and money. He dropped out of high school in his senior year before graduation, but remained an avid reader. His mother died in the mental hospital in 1930. During the Dust Bowl years, Guthrie migrated to California looking for work. He partnered with Maxine “Lefty Lou” Crissman on the “Woody and Lefty Lou Show” on the radio, but were fired after the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany in 1939. He, Pete Seeger, Will Geer, and others went to New York City. In February 1940, Guthrie wrote his most famous song “This Land Is Your Land.” His autobiography, Bound for Glory, was published in 1943. He served in the U.S. Merchant Marine during WWII. By the late 1940s, Guthrie started showing symptoms of Huntington’s disease, but like his mother, he was misdiagnosed. He returned to California, and lived at the Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theatre founded and owned by Will Geer. His arm was badly burned in a fire, leaving him unable to play his guitar. Increasingly debilitated by Huntington’s, Guthrie was hospitalized at a series of psychiatric hospitals from 1956 until his death at age 55 in October 1967.

I Ain't Got No Home

by Woody Guthrie

.

I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin' 'round

Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town

And the police make it hard wherever I may go

And I ain't got no home in this world anymore

.

My brothers and my sisters are stranded on this road

A hot and dusty road that a million feet have trod

Rich man took my home and drove me from my door

And I ain't got no home in this world anymore

.

Was a-farmin' on the shares, and always I was poor

My crops I lay into the banker's store

My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor

And I ain't got no home in this world anymore

.

I mined in your mines and I gathered in your corn

I been working, mister, since the day I was born

Now I worry all the time like I never did before

'Cause I ain't got no home in this world anymore

.

Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see

This world is such a great and a funny place to be

Oh, the gamblin' man is rich an' the workin' man is poor

And I ain't got no home in this world anymore

.

A Lament for the Motherland

by Himayat Ali Shair

.

“The vultures sitting over my body

Are snatching every piece of my meat

My eyes, the nest of beautiful dreams

My tongue, the mirror of pearl-like words

My arms, the guarantors of the interpretation of dreams

My heart, in which every impossible, becomes possible

My spirit is watching this whole spectacle

Thinking

Was this entire game

(My corpse over the table-cloth of savages)

Meant for the pleasures of eating and drinking?”

.

“Madar-e-Vatan Ka Nauha” (“A Lament for the Motherland”) was written in 1958 in response to the first military coup in Pakistan, led by the army’s Commander-in-Chief Ayub Khan. It was published in his complete collection Kuliyat-e-Shair, © 2007

Confinement

by Christina Goh

.

We have become eagles

who glaze over the information peaks

from sunrise to sunset

trumpeted in all languages, in colors,

in plumes of sweetness and vigor

masters of the dreamlike airs…

Today we are lions

who roar their fury of life

or spread out, troubled in the sunlight

of their screens, watching the family

of the world, waiting for the best

and theories in the wind

.

But who would have believed it?

by the glow of virtual campfires

for a reconstructed holiday,

the shadows of the past took pity

and before disappearing,

they turned us into griffins.

Congress

by Richard Armour

.

Politics, it seems to me,

For years, or all too long,

Has been concerned with right or left

Instead of right or wrong.

Blatant Resistance

by Bub Bridger

.

I have a new scarlet coat and

I look like a fire engine

And I don't give a damn

One should grow old gracefully

Somebody said - I don't know who

But I've heard it all my life and

So you have to but to hell with that

I refuse to grow old anyway

But reluctantly and bold as brass

And when my arthritis bites in all

My bones and sleep sulks outside

My bedroom window in the dark

I just toss and turn and scratch

And swear the hours away I'm not

Growing older - it's the stupid

Betrayal of bones and flesh

That makes me feel this way but

.

Look at me now with springs in

My heels and the wind in my hair

Any moment I'll start whistling

And might even dance you a jig

And stop all the traffic along the

Quay wearing my new scarlet coat

And looking like a fire engine

.

Blasphemy – American Style

by Esther Popel

.

Look, God,

We've got a ni**er here

To burn;

.

A goddam ni**er,

And we're goin' to plunge

His cringin' soul

To Hell!

.

Now watch him

Squirm and wriggle

While we swing him

From this tree!

.

And listen, God,

You'll laugh at this

I know—

.

He wants to pray

Before we stage

This show!

.

He's scared

And can't remember

What to say—

.

Imagine, God,

A ni**er tryin'

To pray!

.

Lean over, God,

And listen while we tell

This fool

.

The words

He couldn't even

Spell!

.

"Our Father

Who art in Heaven,"

(Say it again!)

.

"Thy will be done

On earth . . ." (Laugh, God!)

"Amen!"

.

To Hell with him!

Come on, men,

Swing him high!

.

A prayin' ni**er,

Golly--

Watch him die!

The Way In

by Linda Hogan

.

Sometimes the way to milk and honey is

through the body.

Sometimes the way in is a song.

But there are three ways in the world: dangerous,

wounding, and beauty.

To enter stone, be water.

To rise through hard earth, be plant

desiring sunlight, believing in water.

To enter fire, be dry.

To enter life, be food.

1921 – Hannah Szenes Hungarian Jewish poet and playwright born in Budapest, Hungary, who became a Zionist, and immigrated to Palestine in 1939. In 1943, she became one of 37 Jewish Palmah (Hanagnah strike force) recruits from Mandate Palestine that took part in a British SOE operation, after being trained as paratroopers. In March 1944, she was dropped into Yugoslavia in order to aid local anti-Nazi forces. Szenes was captured in June after entering Hungary, and sent to a prison in Budapest, where she was tortured. Since Szenes would not talk, Hungarian authorities arrested her mother. Both women remained silent. Szenes refused to beg for a pardon in November 1944, and was shot by a firing squad at age 23. Szenes’s mother kept her daughter’s memory alive, publishing Szenes’s diary, poetry, and plays.

Blessed is the Match

by Hannah Szenes

.

Blessed is the match consumed in kindling flame.

Blessed is the flame that burns in the secret fastness of the heart.

Blessed is the heart with strength to stop its beating for honor’s sake.

Blessed is the match consumed in kindling flame.

Solemn Drums of Tragedy

by Nikos Karouzos

.

Electra you are now daughter of a king amid the nightingales

adders in your eyes, tigress in your hands, with silken soles

you tread upon all with gloomy love and lamenting epitaphs

the phallic majesty of your father,

you pad along all alone as

Clytemenstra for a few seconds,

whispers the vile electrons of her body

and Aegisthus drenched in blood abandons his erection

death sovereign of each and all declares itself

winding the catharsis in unblemished gloom.

Justice comes from everywhere and glows all over.

A Glance

by Zheng Min

.

What’s beautiful are the two shoulders sinking

into the shadows locking the chest, rich as an orchard.

Only the radiant face, a dream suddenly appearing,

corresponds to the slim fingers that rest on the low gate.

.

River of time carries away another leaf.

From her half lowering eyes, sphinxlike, flows out a tranquility

that dazzles. Her unchangeable calm is facing a limited life

when in a chance evening she casts a long glance

at this changing world.

1990 ― Xu Lizhi, Chinese poet and factory worker born in Jieyang in Guangdong Province to a farming family. He was interested in reading and learning, but had very limited access to books. After his test scores on the national entrance exams for college were too low to gain admission, he became depressed. In July 2010, he went to Shenzhen, a larger city in his province which is a center for technology and manufacturing. He went to work for Hon Hai, multinational electronics manufacturer. In October, 2010 while recovering from an appendectomy, he posted one of his poems on his blog for the first time. He had a three-year contract at Hon Hai, but working conditions were poor, causing coughing, headaches and trouble sleeping. He wrote for a local newspaper, and published poems and reviews online and in magazines. Xu tried to find other work, applying for jobs in libraries, but wasn’t hired. In September 2014, at age 24, he committed suicide by jumping off a building. His blog posted a new message after his death, and his friends published a collection of his poems, leading to some of them being translated into English.

I Swallowed an Iron Moon

by Xu Lizhi

.

I swallowed an iron moon

they called it a screw

.

I swallowed industrial wastewater and unemployment forms

bent over machines, our youth died young

.

I swallowed labor, I swallowed poverty

swallowed pedestrian bridges, swallowed this rusted-out life

.

I can’t swallow any more

everything I’ve swallowed roils up in my throat

.

I spread across my country

a poem of shame

1875 – Alice Moore Dunbar Nelson born as Alice Ruth Moore, in New Orleans, Louisiana; African-American author poet, columnist, short story writer, activist, diarist, and teacher.

In 1924, she campaigned for passage of the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, but it was defeated by the white Southern bloc. Between 1928 and 1932, she toured as a public speaker for the American Friends Inter-Racial Peace Committee. Dunbar Nelson died from a heart ailment in September, 1935, at age 60.

I Sit and Sew

by Alice Moore Dunbar Nelson

.

I sit and sew—a useless task it seems,

My hands grown tired, my head weighed down with dreams—

The panoply of war, the martial tread of men,

Grim-faced, stern-eyed, gazing beyond the ken

Of lesser souls, whose eyes have not seen Death,

Nor learned to hold their lives but as a breath—

But—I must sit and sew.

.

I sit and sew—my heart aches with desire—

That pageant terrible, that fiercely pouring fire

On wasted fields, and writhing grotesque things

Once men. My soul in pity flings

Appealing cries, yearning only to go

There in that holocaust of hell, those fields of woe—

But—I must sit and sew.

.

The little useless seam, the idle patch;

Why dream I here beneath my homely thatch,

When there they lie in sodden mud and rain,

Pitifully calling me, the quick ones and the slain?

You need me, Christ! It is no roseate dream

That beckons me—this pretty futile seam,

It stifles me—God, must I sit and sew?

.

1927 – Simin Behbahani born as Simin Khalili. Her parents met because her mother, Fakhr-Ozmaa Arghoun, wrote a poem, and sent it to Nedaay-e-Islam’ the newspaper where her father, Abbas Khalili, who was also a poet, was editor-in-chief. He liked the poem, but was surprised to find the poet was a woman. This began their courtship. They married, but less than a month layer the political storm at the end of Ahmad Shah Qajar’s reign as Shah of Persia forced Khalili into exile, unaware that his new wife was already pregnant. Abbas Khalili did not see his daughter until she was 14-months-old, then didn’t see her again until she was eleven. Raised by her mother, who became known for her poetry, as a social activist, and as a founding member of the Iranian Committee of Nationalist Women. Her mother married another newspaper editor, Aadel Khalatbari, and changed her name to Fakhr Aadel. Behbahani started writing poetry at age 14, but felt too shy to show anyone her poems. Her mother found one, and not only encouraged her to write more, she also sent the poem she discovered to a literary editor she knew, who was amazed it was written by a 14-year-old. He published it in his newspaper under the name Simin Khalatbari. In 1941, Simin joined the Tudeh Party’s Youth Organization, a Communist group, which caused her trouble at school; when an anonymous report appeared in a newspaper criticizing the administration’s management of the school, she was immediately suspected, and was expelled. She married her first suitor, Hassan Behbahani, and from then on published her work as Simin Behbahani. There was conflict in the marriage almost from the beginning. She continued her studies, went to law school, then became a teacher, but her poetry brought her increasing recognition. She and her husband had two sons and a daughter during the 20 years they lived together, but they ultimately separated. In 2006, Iranian authorities shut down an opposition newspaper for printing one of her works, the same year she was hit by a policeman during an International Women’s Day rally. In 2010, about to board a plane for Paris, 82-year-old Simin Behbahani, now almost blind, was arrested andinterrogated for hours about her poems on Iran’s 2009 elections. Her passport was confiscated, and she was barred from leaving the country. No legal basis was given for the travel ban. Simin Behbahani earned her title, ‘the Lioness of Iran.’ She died of heart disease at age 87 in August 2014. Thousands came to honor her at her funeral.

Necklace

by Simin Behbahani

.

Anxious, agitated, sad,

her face uncovered, her head unveiled,

not afraid of arrest or policeman,

oblivious to the order, “Cover! Conceal!”

Her eyes two grapes plucked from their cluster,

squeezed by the times to fill a hundred barrels with blood,

mad, really mad, a stranger to herself and others,

oblivious to the world, beyond being awakened even by the deluge,

a particle of dust adrift in the wind, without purpose or destination,

lost, speechless, bewildered, a corpse without a grave,

carrying around her neck a necklace of curses and tears,

a pair of boots tied together belonging to a dead soldier.

I asked her: what does this mean?

She smiled: my son, poor child, sitting on my shoulders,

hasn’t taken off his boots yet.

The Road

by Helene Johnson

.

Ah, little road all whirry in the breeze,

A leaping clay hill lost among the trees,

The bleeding note of rapture streaming thrush

Caught in a drowsy hush

And stretched out in a single singing line of dusky song.

Ah little road, brown as my race is brown,

Your trodden beauty like our trodden pride,

Dust of the dust, they must not bruise you down.

Rise to one brimming golden, spilling cry!

.

The Struggle Staggers Us

by Margaret Walker

.

Our birth and death are easy hours, like sleep

and food and drink. The struggle staggers us

for bread, for pride, for simple dignity.

And this is more than fighting to exist;

more than revolt and war and human odds.

There is a journey from the me to you.

There is a journey from the you to me.

A union of the two strange worlds must be.

.

Ours is a struggle from a too-warm bed;

too cluttered with a patience full of sleep.

Out of this blackness we must struggle forth;

from want of bread, of pride, of dignity.

Struggle between the morning and the night.

This marks our years; this settles, too, our plight.

.

Hatred

by Gwendolyn B. Bennett

.

I shall hate you

Like a dart of singing steel

Shot through still air

At even-tide,

Or solemnly

As pines are sober

When they stand etched

Against the sky.

Hating you shall be a game

Played with cool hands

And slim fingers.

Your heart will yearn

For the lonely splendor

Of the pine tree

While rekindled fires

In my eyes

Shall wound you like swift arrows.

Memory will lay its hands

Upon your breast

And you will understand

My hatred.

.

(1926)

1944 – Mourid Barghouti born in Deir Ghassaneh (now Bani Zeid), near Ramallah in the Governorate of Palestine. He studied English Literature at Cairo University, graduating in 1967, only to be barred from his homeland after the Six-Day War in June that year. Barghouti spent thirty years in exile—shuttling among the world’s cities, never secure—never certain whether he was a visitor, a refugee, a citizen, or a guest—separated from his family for years at a time. He was married to the novelist Radwa Shour. Their son Tamim, is also a poet. Barghouti’s memoir, I Saw Ramallah, won the 2003 Naguib Mahfouz Medal for Literature. He published 13 books of poetry, but only A Small Sun and Midnight and Other Poems have been translated into English. He died at age 78 in Jordan, in February 2021.

Without Mercy

by Mourid Barghouti

.

There is a sweet music,

but its sweetness fails to console you.

This is what the days have taught you:

in every long war

there is a soldier, with a distracted face and ordinary teeth,

who sits outside his tent

holding his bright-sounding harmonica

which he has carefully protected from the dust and blood,

and like a bird

uninvolved in the conflict,

he sings to himself

a love song

that does not lie.

.

For a moment,

he feels embarrassed at what the moonlight might think:

what's the use of a harmonica in hell?

.

A shadow approaches,

then more shadows.

His fellow soldiers, one after the other,

join him in his song.

The singer takes the whole regiment with him

to Romeo's balcony,

and from there,

without thinking,

without mercy,

without doubt,

they will resume the killing!

1936 – June Jordan born in Harlem, New York, the only child of Jamaican immigrant parents. She was a poet, essayist, teacher, feminist, civil rights activist, and self-identified Bisexual. While the students at most of the schools she attended were predominately White, at Barnard College, “No one ever presented me with a single Black author, poet, historian, personage, or idea for that matter. Nor was I ever assigned a single woman to study as a thinker, or writer, or poet, or life force ... Nothing showed me how I might try to alter the political and economic realities underlying our Black condition in white America.” She left without graduating, but returned later. Her first book, Who Look at Me, a collection of poems for children, was published in 1969. She wrote 27 more books, the last three published posthumously. Jordan was the librettist for the musical Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky. She taught at several colleges and at SUNY at Stony Brook, then founded the Poetry for the People program at UC Berkeley in 1991. She died of breast cancer at age 65 in 2002.

Apologies to All the People in Lebanon

by June Jordan

.

Dedicated to the 600,000 Palestinian men, women,

and children who lived in Lebanon from 1948-1983.

.

I didn’t know and nobody told me and what

could I do or say, anyway?

.

They said you shot the London Ambassador

and when that wasn’t true

they said so

what

They said you shelled their northern villages

and when U.N. forces reported that was not true

because your side of the cease-fire was holding

since more than a year before

they said so

what

They said they wanted simply to carve

a 25 mile buffer zone and then

they ravaged your

water supplies your electricity your

hospitals your schools your highways and byways all

the way north to Beirut because they said this

was their quest for peace

They blew up your homes and demolished the grocery

stores and blocked the Red Cross and took away doctors

to jail and they cluster-bombed girls and boys

whose bodies

swelled purple and black into twice the original size

and tore the buttocks from a four month old baby

and then

they said this was brilliant

military accomplishment and this was done

they said in the name of self-defense they said

that is the noblest concept

of mankind isn’t that obvious?

They said something about never again and then

they made close to one million human beings homeless

in less than three weeks and they killed or maimed

40,000 of your men and your women and your children

.

But I didn’t know and nobody told me and what

could I do or say, anyway?

.

They said they were victims. They said you were

Arabs.

They called your apartments and gardens guerrilla

strongholds.

They called the screaming devastation

that they created the rubble.

Then they told you to leave, didn’t they?

.

Didn’t you read the leaflets that they dropped

from their hotshot fighter jets?

They told you to go.

One hundred and thirty-five thousand

Palestinians in Beirut and why

didn’t you take the hint?

Go!

There was the Mediterranean: You

could walk into the water and stay

there.

What was the problem?

.

I didn’t know and nobody told me and what

could I do or say, anyway?

.

Yes, I did know it was the money I earned as a poet that

paid

for the bombs and the planes and the tanks

that they used to massacre your family

.

But I am not an evil person

The people of my country aren't so bad

.

You can expect but so much

from those of us who have to pay taxes and watch

American TV

.

You see my point;

.

I’m sorry.

I really am sorry.

1640 – Aphra Behn born in Kent, in southeastern England; English poet and one of the most influential Restoration era playwrights. Her parentage remains disputed, and her early years unknown. She was a traveler; a widow; a spy for an English King who then didn’t pay her, so she was thrown into debtor’s prison, then wrote her way out. She was also a novelist, and one of the few women of her time to write under her own name and earn her living by her pen. Behn was vividly talented, outspokenly opinionated, self-supporting, scandalous, and legendary —Aphra Behn refused to accept the restrictions society imposed on women. She lived by her own rules, even in her last years, when illness made it difficult for her to write.

Love Armed

by Aphra Behn

.

Love in fantastic triumph sat,

Whilst bleeding hearts around him flow’d,

For whom fresh pains he did create,

And strange tyrannic power he shew’d;

From thy bright eyes he took his fire,

Which round about in sport he hurl’d;

But ’twas from mine he took desire

Enough to undo the amorous world.

.

From me he took his sighs and tears,

From thee his pride and cruelty;

From me his languishments and fears,

And every killing dart from thee;

Thus thou and I the God have arm’d,

And set him up a Deity;

But my poor heart alone is harm’d,

Whilst thine the victor is, and free.

.

1875 – Edmund Clerihew Bentley born in London, England; English journalist, novelist, and poet. He attended London’s prestigious St Paul’s School. Gilbert Keith (G. K.) Chesterton was a fellow student, and became his best friend. When Bentley was 16 years old, he started to write short verses about people he knew, or famous people he had read about, which became known as Clerihews. Chesterton took up the hobby too and the rhymes were often accompanied by his sketches. Clerihews have 4 lines, the subject’s name is in the first line, the rhyme scheme is AA/BB, it tells you something about the subject, and it should be amusing. In 1913, exasperated with the infallibility of Sherlock Holmes, he published Trent’s Last Case, regarded as the first “modern” detective novel. E.C. Bentley may be the only author credited with starting two literary forms, one in poetry and the other in genre fiction. He died at age 80 in March 1956.

This is the first known Clerihew:

1561 – Luis de Góngora y Argote born to a noble family in Córdoba, Spain; influential Spanish Baroque poet and Catholic predendary (administrative clergy). He was ordained in his twenties, but did not become an ordained priest until he was in his 50s.He divided most of his time between Valladolid in northern Spain and Madrid, but often traveled to carry out his duties. As a poet, he had a long feud with his chief rival Francisco de Quevedo. They attacked each other with bitter satirical poems. The feud led to Quevedo buying the house where Góngora was living, and then evicting him. Góngora became seriously ill, returned to Córdoba, and died there at age 65 in May 1627. His legacy rests mainly on two long poems: Fábula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea) and Soledades (Loneliness).

‘Sacred temple of pure honesty’

(De pura honestidad templo sagrado)

by Luis de Góngora y Argote

.

Sacred temple of pure honesty,

Whose foundation and noble wall

Of white nacre and hard alabaster,

Was fashioned by a hand divine,

.

Little door of precious coral,

Clear windows of sure gaze,

Where you transmute purest green

To finest emerald among men,

.

Lofty roof whose golden summits

In the glowing sun, as the eye moves,

Dress it in light, crown it in beauty,

.

Beautiful form, whom the humble worship,

Hear, with pity, one who sighs for you,

Sings your hymns; lauds your virtues.

.

Card of Thanks

by E. B. White

.

A spaniel’s ears hang low, hang low;

They mop the sidewalk as they go.

Instead of burrs and beggar’s-lice,

They pick up things not half so nice.

.

Spaniels deserve our special thanks

For mopping floors in shops and banks,

Resourceful, energetic, keen,

They keep the city nice and clean.

.

Spaniels should be exempt from tax

And be supplied with Johnson’s wax.

1904 – Pablo Neruda was born in Parral, Chile, as Ricardo Eliécer Neftalí Reyes Basoalto. He was a Chilean diplomat, politician, author, and a poet whose poems were honored with the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971. He is considered the national poet of Chile. Neruda’s writing covered a wide range: historical epics, political manifestos, an autobiography, surrealist poems, and passionate love poetry. His first collection of verse, Crepusculario (Book of Twilights) was published in 1923 under his pen name, Pablo Neruda. Crepusculario was quickly followed in 1924 by Veinte poemas de amor y una canción desesperada (Twenty Love Poems and A Desperate Song), which is still the best-selling book of poetry in the Spanish language. He was a member of Chilean diplomatic missions in Burma, Argentina, Spain, Mexico, and was in France when he ended his diplomatic career upon being diagnosed with cancer. He died Santiago in September 1973 at age 69. Pinochet, Chile’s military dictator who had just staged his coup d’état, refused permission for Neruda’s funeral to be public, but thousands of defiant mourners attended, surrounded by a massive police presence.

Cat's Dream

by Pablo Neruda

.

How neatly a cat sleeps,

sleeps with its paws and its posture,

sleeps with its wicked claws,

and with its unfeeling blood,

sleeps with all the rings –

a series of burnt circles –

which have formed the odd geology

of its sand-colored tail.

.

I should like to sleep like a cat,

with all the fur of time,

with a tongue rough as flint,

with the dry sex of fire;

and after speaking to no one,

stretch myself over the world,

over roofs and landscapes,

with a passionate desire

to hunt the rats in my dreams.

.

I have seen how the cat asleep

would undulate, how the night

flowed through it like dark water;

and at times,it was going to fall

or possibly plunge into

the bare deserted snowdrifts.

Sometimes it grew so much in sleep

like a tiger's great-grandfather,

and would leap in the darkness over

rooftops, clouds and volcanoes.

.

Sleep, sleep cat of the night

with episcopal ceremony

and your stone-carved moustache.

Take care of all our dreams

control the obscurity

of our slumbering prowess

with your relentless heart

and the great ruff of your tail.

.

The Owl

by Briceida Cuevas Cob

.

The owl is here.

He perches on the wall. And meditates.

Whose death does he announce

if no one lives in this village?

The fossils of the people

do not cross to either side.

.

The tombs in the cemetery paint the moon

that has begun to chew the underbrush.

The owl

rehearses a song to life.

It refuses to presage its own death.

Telephone Conversation

by Wole Soyinka

.

The price seemed reasonable, location

Indifferent. The landlady swore she lived

Off premises. Nothing remained

But self-confession. "Madam" , I warned,

"I hate a wasted journey - I am African."

Silence. Silenced transmission of pressurized good-breeding. Voice, when it came,

Lipstick coated, long gold-rolled

Cigarette-holder pipped. Caught I was, foully.

"HOW DARK?"...I had not misheard...."ARE YOU LIGHT OR VERY DARK?" Button B. Button A. Stench

Of rancid breath of public hide-and-speak.

Red booth. Red pillar-box. Red double-tiered

Omnibus squelching tar.

It was real! Shamed

By ill-mannered silence, surrender

Pushed dumbfoundment to beg simplification.

Considerate she was, varying the emphasis-

"ARE YOU DARK? OR VERY LIGHT" Revelation came

"You mean- like plain or milk chocolate?"

Her accent was clinical, crushing in its light

Impersonality. Rapidly, wave-length adjusted

I chose. "West African sepia"_ and as afterthought.

"Down in my passport." Silence for spectroscopic

Flight of fancy, till truthfulness chaged her accent

Hard on the mouthpiece "WHAT'S THAT?" conceding "DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS." "Like brunette."

"THAT'S DARK, ISN'T IT?"

"Not altogether.

Facially, I am brunette, but madam you should see the rest of me. Palm of my hand, soles of my feet.

Are a peroxide blonde. Friction, caused-

Foolishly madam- by sitting down, has turned

My bottom raven black- One moment madam! - sensing

Her receiver rearing on the thunderclap

About my ears- "Madam," I pleaded, "wouldn't you rather

See for yourself?"

.

1911 – Czeslaw Milosz born in Šeteniai, Kovno Governorate, Russian Empire (now part of Lithuania); prolific Polish poet, author, translator, and diplomat; awarded 1980 Nobel Prize in Literature. His father was a Polish civil engineer, and his mother was from a distinguished Polish-Lithuanian family. He survived the German occupation of Warsaw during WWII, and helped save some Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto. A cultural attaché for the Polish government during the postwar period, he defected to France after communist authorities threatened him, then came to the U.S., becoming a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and a naturalized U.S. citizen. His work was banned in Poland for three decades, but his poetry and nonfiction book, The Captive Mind, made him a leading émigré artist and intellectual in the West. After the 1989 fall of communism in Poland, he divided time between the U.S. and Kraków. He died at age 93 in August 2004 in Kraków. His poetry collections include Trzy zimy (Three Winters); Na brzegu rzeki (Facing the River); and Druga przestrzen (The Second Space).

A Song on the End of the World

by Czeslaw Milosz

.

On the day the world ends

A bee circles a clover,

A fisherman mends a glimmering net.

Happy porpoises jump in the sea,

By the rainspout young sparrows are playing

And the snake is gold-skinned as it should always be.

.

On the day the world ends

Women walk through the fields under their umbrellas,

A drunkard grows sleepy at the edge of a lawn,

Vegetable peddlers shout in the street

And a yellow-sailed boat comes nearer the island,

The voice of a violin lasts in the air

And leads into a starry night.

.

And those who expected lightning and thunder

Are disappointed.

And those who expected signs and archangels’ trumps

Do not believe it is happening now.

As long as the sun and the moon are above,

As long as the bumblebee visits a rose,

As long as rosy infants are born

No one believes it is happening now.

.

Only a white-haired old man, who would be a prophet

Yet is not a prophet, for he’s much too busy,

Repeats while he binds his tomatoes:

There will be no other end of the world,

There will be no other end of the world.

.

– Warsaw, 1944

1920 – Eleanor Ross Taylor born in Norwood, North Carolina; American author, poet. She graduated from the Woman’s College of the University of North Carolina in 1940, then worked as a high school English teacher. She then went to Vanderbilt University for master’s work, but married novelist Peter Taylor in 1943, and did little writing until the late 1950s. Her first poetry collection, A Wilderness of Ladies, was published in 1960. Her second book, Welcome Eumenides, appeared in 1972. A third book drew little attention, but her fourth, Days Going, Days Coming Back, and her next two books Late Leisure and Captive Voices: New and Selected Poems, were chosen by poet and editor Dave Smith for inclusion in poetry series which he edited, and brought attention to her work. Several awards were then given to her: the 1998 Shelley Memorial Award by the Poetry Society of America; the 2000 Aiken Taylor Award for Modern American Poetry; the 2010 William Carlos Williams Award; and the 2010 Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. Eleanor Ross Taylor died at age 91 in December 2011.

Kitchen Fable

by Eleanor Ross Taylor

.

The fork lived with the knife

and found it hard — for years

took nicks and scratches,

not to mention cuts.

.

She who took tedium by the ears:

nonforthcoming pickles,

defiant stretched-out lettuce,

sauce-gooed particles.

.

He who came down whack.

His conversation, even, edged.

.

Lying beside him in the drawer

she formed a crazy patina.

The seasons stacked —

melons, succeeded by cured pork.

.

He dulled; he was a dull knife,

while she was, after all, a fork.

.

The Lives of Poets

by José Emilio Pacheco

.

In poetry there’s no happy ending.

Poets end up

living their madness.

And they’re quartered like cattle

(it happened to Darío).

Or they’re stoned or wind up

flinging themselves to the sea or with cyanide

salts in their mouths.

Or dead from alcoholism, drug addiction, poverty.

Or worse: canonical poets,

bitter inhabitants of a tomb

entitled Complete Works.

The Mad Soldier

by E. Wyndham Tennant

I dropp'd here three weeks ago, yes ~ I know,

And it's bitter cold at night, since the fight ~

I could tell you if I chose ~ no one knows

Excep' me and four or five, what ain't alive

I can see them all asleep, three men deep,

And they're nowhere near a fire ~ but our wire

Has 'em fast as fast can be. Can't you see

When the flare goes up? Ssh! Boys; what's that noise?

Do you know what these rats eat? Body-meat!

After you've been down a week, 'an your cheek

Gets as pale as life, and night seems as white

As the day, only the rats and their brats

Seem more hungry when the day's gone away ~

An' they look as big as bulls, an' they pulls

Till you almost sort o' shout ~ but the drought

What you hadn't felt before makes you sore.

And at times you even think of a drink…

There's a leg acrost my thighs ~ if my eyes

Weren't too sore, I'd like to see who it be,

Wonder if I'd know the bloke if I woke? ~

Woke? By damn, I'm not asleep ~ there's a heap

Of us wond'ring why the hell we're not well…

Leastways I am ~ since I came it's the same

With the others ~ they don't know what I do,

Or they wouldn't gape and grin. ~ It's a sin

To say that Hell is hot ~ 'cause it's not:

Mind you, I know very well we're in hell.

~ In a twisted hump we lie ~ heaping high

Yes! an' higher every day. ~ Oh, I say,

This chap's heavy on my thighs ~ damn his eyes.

Weathering Hate

by Harryette Mullen

.

The way, exposed to weather, a body is worn.

Velvet threads begin to

wither, rapid ripened beyond the burst bloom.

Vibrant strands, cut short,

fray, unweaving faded fabric. Sun-struck,

rain-warped, storm-blasted,

rough-sanded in whipping wind that whittles rock.

.

Small, torturous fractures opened in stone where

water freezes in the

pores with grains of salt. Cracks in the surface

pried apart by unrelenting

pressure. With incessant freezing and thawing,

shock and fatigue speed

rugged stress to ultimate breakdown.

Intemperate weather, abrading edges,

gradually disintegrates resolute minerals.

.

A boulder, even a mountain, will wear down. So

will bodies, bent and

broken under toilsome burdens, caving

beneath unbearable weight, in

adverse climate, exposed to harsh elements,

caustic rains.

Cat in an Empty Apartment

by Wisława Szymborska

.

Die — you can’t do that to a cat.

Since what can a cat do

in an empty apartment?

Climb the walls?

Rub up against the furniture?

Nothing seems different here

but nothing is the same.

Nothing’s been moved

but there’s more space.

And at nighttime no lamps are lit.

.

Footsteps on the staircase,

but they’re new ones.

The hand that puts fish on the saucer

has changed, too.

.

Something doesn’t start

at its usual time.

Something doesn’t happen

as it should.

Someone was always, always here,

then suddenly disappeared

and stubbornly stays disappeared.

.

Every closet’s been examined.

Every shelf has been explored.

Excavations under the carpet turned up nothing.

A commandment was even broken:

papers scattered everywhere.

What remains to be done.

.

Just sleep and wait.

Just wait till he turns up,

just let him show his face.

Will he ever get a lesson

on what not to do to a cat.

Sidle toward him

as if unwilling

and ever so slow

on visibly offended paws,

and no leaps or squeals at least to start.

.

I hope to God you will not ask

by Esther G. Belin

I hope to God you will not ask me to go anywhere except my own country. If we go back, we will follow whatever orders you give us. We do not want to go right or left, but straight back to our own land.

—Barboncito

.

I hope to God you will not ask

Me or my People to send

Postcard greetings: lamented wind

Of perfect sunrisings, golden

Yes, we may share the same sun setting

But the in-between hours are hollow

The People fill the void with prayers for help

Calling upon the Holy Ones

Those petitions penetrate and loosen

The binds you tried to tighten

Around our heart, a tension

Blocking the wind, like a shell

Fluttering inside, fluttering inside

1860 – Charlotte Perkins Gilman born in Hartford Connecticut; American feminist leader, author, poet, editor, sociologist, economist, and science fiction writer. Her father abandoned the family while she was still an infant, and they often had to stay wilt relatives. Charlotte was in and out of seven different schools, often missing days and weeks, and she left when she was 15. An avid reader, she spent much time at public libraries. She did learn painting at the Rhode Island School of Design, then supported herself painting cards, and tutoring. She is best known for her subtly terrifying short-story “The Yellow Wallpaper,” written after she suffered from post-partum depression during her first marriage, compounded by the complete forced isolation treatment which made her condition even worse. Her non-fiction works, such as Women and Economics, and The Home: Its Work and Influence, contributed much to feminist thought. From 1909-1916, Gilman single-handedly wrote and edited The Forerunner, a monthly magazine where many of her ideas first appeared. She produced 86 issues, each 28 pages long, for nearly 1,500 subscribers, from 1909 through 1916. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1932. A believer in euthanasia, she committed suicide with an overdose of chloroform at age 75 in August 1935.

The Socialist and the Suffragist

by Charlotte Perkins Gilman

.

Said the Socialist to the Suffragist:

“My cause is greater than yours!

You only work for a Special Class,

We work for the gain of the General Mass,

Which every good ensures!”

.

Said the Suffragist to the Socialist:

“You underrate my Cause!

While women remain a Subject Class,

You never can move the General Mass,

With your Economic Laws!”

.

Said the Socialist to the Suffragist:

“You misinterpret facts!

There is no room for doubt or schism

In Economic Determinism–

It governs all our acts!”

.

Said the Suffragist to the Socialist:

“You men will always find

That this old world will never move

More swiftly in its ancient groove

While women stay behind!”

.

“A lifted world lifts women up,”

The Socialist explained.

“You cannot lift the world at all

While half of it is kept so small,”

The Suffragist maintained.

.

The world awoke, and tartly spoke:

“Your work is all the same:

Work together or work apart,

Work, each of you, with all your heart–

Just get into the game!”

.

the key is under the flower pots'

One of its leaves

was still in his hand.

Repose

by Adrienne Lewis

For those on earth can much advance us here.

— Dante

.

Catholics have it all wrong: Purgatory

is not in the afterlife. It is the aisle in a grocery store

where your husband ignores you, the bed covers

you lie beneath alone. Never knowing if he will ask you

to leave this place. It is not the dead

in need of prayers; the living are the punished.

Trapped in a car with someone

they can’t ask to stop, a person who never speaks

sitting across the table from them.

It is easy to see why they linger

near others of their kind. Seeking release

they want to be whole again and remember

what it was like to reside in the world unfettered,

without thirty pieces of silver lining

their pockets.

1923 – Mitsuye Yamada born as Mitsuye Yasutake in Fukuoka, Japan; Japanese-American activist, feminist, fiction author, poet, essayist, editor and professor of English. Her father worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the family lived in Seattle. Immediately after Pearl Harbor, her father was wrongfully arrested by the FBI for espionage, so her family was interned at Mindoka War Relocation Center in Idaho. She was only allowed to attend the University of Cincinnati after she renounced loyalty to the Emperor of Japan. Her first book, Camp Notes and Other Poems, was written during the war, but not published until 1976. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1955, five years after her marriage to Yoshikasu Yamada, who was born in Hawaii, and had served as a medic and a translator in the U.S. Army during WWII. Her other works include Lighthouse, her essay “Invisibility is an Unnatural Disaster,” and Full Circle: New and Selected Poems.

lasting forever)

Smile!

1765 – Catherine Maria Fanshawe born Shabden in Chipstead, Surrey, England; English writer, poet, and etcher. Her father was a squire who held a post in the household of King George III. After his death in 1816, she and her two sisters were his heirs. They divided their time between a house in London, the family home in Surrey, but also spent several winters in Italy because of ill health. Some of Catherine’s poems were printed in literary publications in 1820s, and then a collection of poems was published posthumously after her death at age 68 in April 1834.

When Last We Parted

by Catherine Maria Fanshawe

.

When last we parted, thou wert young and fair,

How beautiful let fond remembrance say!

Alas! since then old time has stolen away

Full thirty years, leaving my temples bare.—

So has it perished like a thing of air,

The dream of love and youth!— now both are grey

Yet still remembering that delightful day,

Though time with his cold touch has blanched my hair,

Though I have suffered many years of pain

Since then, though I did never think to live

To hear that voice or see those eyes again,

I can a sad but cordial greeting give,

And for thy welfare breathe as warm a prayer—

As when I loved thee young and fair.

.

“When Last We Parted” from The Literary Remains of Catherine Mary Fanshawe; with Notes by the Late Reverend William Harness, originally published in 1876

In my invincible summer

by William Wall

.

In my invincible summer

I walk the fields

skirting the frozen pools

stepping daintily

like an excited foal

.

in the broken lines

of a wintery morning

with no grand gesture

the old year is dying

.

through the ice

the stubble tells

of harvest past

and golden days

.

and the hill rises

like a breaking wave

a buzzard circling

in the steel grey

.

three thousand cases

is the estimate

we circle the same place

but we’re far from home yet

.

1888 – Anna Akhmatova born as Anna Andreyevna Gorenko near Odessa, Ukraine, but grew up in Tsarskoye Selo (now Pushkin) near St. Petersburg. One of the most acclaimed and significant Russian poets of the 20th century, she remained in the USSR even after her work was condemned and censored by Stalinist authorities. She wrote in secret about the horrors of living under Stalin. Requiem, her interconnected poems about Stalin’s Great Purge, is considered her masterwork. Her first husband was executed by the Soviet secret police, and her son spent many years in a Gulag. Requiem, written and rewritten between 1935 and 1961, was published in Germany in 1963. In 1987, Requiem was finally published in Russia, 21 years after her death at age 76.

You Will Hear Thunder

by Anna Akhmatova

.

You will hear thunder and remember me,

And think: she wanted storms. The rim

Of the sky will be the colour of hard crimson,

And your heart, as it was then, will be on fire.

.

That day in Moscow, it will all come true,

when, for the last time, I take my leave,

And hasten to the heights that I have longed for,
