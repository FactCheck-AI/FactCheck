Martine McCutcheon spilled the beans on what it was like to kiss ‘posh boy’ Hugh Grant.

Martine starred opposite Hugh in Richard Curtis’ 2003 rom-com Love Actually.

She played Natalie, a junior member of household staff who falls for Grant’s newly-elected Prime-Minister David.

After skirting around each other, the pair share a kiss backstage at a Christmas play just before the curtain rises on them, revealing their romantic moment to everyone watching.

It’s one of the film’s most iconic moments, and Martine confessed she had a lot of fun filming it.

Appearing as a guest panelist on Loose Women, she was asked what it was like to lock lips with Hugh.

She said: ‘I won’t be mysterious he was fabulous. I’m not gonna lie.

‘At first he was very polite and I thought “Posh boys aren’t very good kissers. Maybe they’re not very good kissers these posh boys,” but then when Richard Curtis said to him “Go for it” – ooh, did he!’

Her co-panelist, actress Sherrie Hewson, quipped: ‘This is fantastic for me because it’s been a long time!’

Martine continued: ‘And I kept getting [the kiss] wrong of course so we had to do it again. And then another take, and then another take…’

Host Andrea McLean added: ‘I like Hugh because he looks like he’s a little bit filthy.’

Martine agreed saying: ‘He is filthy but he is fabulous. Fabulously filthy.’
