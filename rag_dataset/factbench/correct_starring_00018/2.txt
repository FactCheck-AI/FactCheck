MARTINE McCutcheon has revealed she never watches Christmas classic Love Actually despite being one of the stars.

The actress, 46, appears alongside huge names including Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson in the flick.

But former EastEnders star Martine insists Love Actually is not a holiday staple in her home, despite its huge popularity nearly two decades since its release.

Speaking to The Sun, she said: "I never watch it… I can’t watch myself, but my family adore it and are so proud that I’m a part of it - as am I!"

Martine, who shares son Rafferty, seven, with husband Jack McManus, also shared what she was hoping to find under the tree this year.

She said: "I’ve been so busy, I’m more just excited to spend time with all the family without worrying about anything.

"I would love some new pyjamas, some silky ones in a dusty blue colour, and obviously every girl loves jewellery!”

Earlier this year Martine opened up to The Sun about her 10 year marriage to musician Jack, 38.

"Both Jack and I have always been honest we don’t have the perfect relationship by any means," she says.

"We’ve had our ups and downs, like everybody. We’ve had our challenges, but I think ultimately we’re each other’s best friend and when life gets tricky and isn’t always as fabulous it’s good you can have somebody you can talk too and confide in and be all of yourself with, and you know that’s a safe space and they’ve got your back.

"I think that hopefully when you look back in your life it’s about the memories you make, and I think sometimes you have to put effort into making those memories, otherwise you look back and it’s all been a fast-paced blur, especially in this day and age.

"I like to take time to celebrate the good moments, and I think that in our industry, especially, it’s a long time."
