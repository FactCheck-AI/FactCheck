Bryan Cranston and Allison Janney are set to star in “Everything’s Going to Be Great,” an upcoming film from Scottish director Jon S. Baird, eOne and Astute films.

Cranston is known for playing antihero Walter White in the HBO television series “Breaking Bad.” Recently, he’s starred in the legal drama series “Your Honor” and David Frankel’s “Jerry and Marge Go Large.” Janney played the mother of Tonya Harding in the biopic “I, Tonya.” She previously in the political drama series “West Wing” and the CBS sitcom “Mom.”

“‘Everything Is Going to Be Great’ is a valentine to big dreamers whose dreams won’t necessarily come true. It’s about individuality vs. conformity, fantasy vs. reality; but mostly, it’s about family. As the Smart family move from one state to the next, they cope with loss and struggle with identity, all while performing in regional theater,” said the project’s reps.

The film is written by Steven Rogers and is produced by Rogers alongside Bryan Unkeless and Alex Lalonde. It’s executive produced by Scott Morgan, Michael Souther and Teza Lawrence.
