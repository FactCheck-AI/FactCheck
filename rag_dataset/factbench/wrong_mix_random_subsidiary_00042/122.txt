Hugh Grant is to play disgraced MP Jeremy Thorpe in a three-part BBC TV drama written by Russell T Davies and directed by Stephen Frears.

In 1979, former Liberal party leader Thorpe was tried and acquitted of conspiring to murder his ex-lover Norman Scott.

Newspapers at the time described it as "the trial of the century".

A Very English Scandal is based on the bestselling book by author and former journalist John Preston.

Thorpe was the first British politician to stand trial for conspiracy and incitement to murder.

In the mid-70s, stories circulated about Thorpe's relationship with a former male model, Norman Scott.

The relationship was alleged to have started in 1961, when male homosexual acts were illegal.

The story broke when Scott was appearing at a court in Barnstaple on a minor social security charge.

During the hearing, Scott shouted out, "I am being hounded because of my sexual relationship with Jeremy Thorpe."

Thorpe issued an immediate denial but when an affectionate letter between them appeared in the press, Thorpe resigned as leader.
