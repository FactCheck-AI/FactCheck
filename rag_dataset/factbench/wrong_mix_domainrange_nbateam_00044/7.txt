The most exciting time of the NBA offseason will kick off July 1 as free agency in the NBA begins and the San Antonio Spurs are reportedly in the mix for players.

According to a report, the Spurs (among other teams) are eyeing sharp-shooter Kyle Korver.

“League sources told the San Antonio Spurs, Los Angeles Clippers and Los Angeles Lakers also have an interest in Korver. Cleveland.com added the Milwaukee Bucks and New Orleans Pelicans to that list.”

Korver just completed his 16th season in the NBA and one with the Cavaliers in which he appeared in 35 games (49% shooting off the bench) after he was traded mid-year from the Atlanta Hawks.

Although Korver, 36, may be considered past his prime and too old, Korver is still an excellent shooter and is a career 43 percent from beyond the arc and can be help spread the floor for San Antonio. Furthermore, the Spurs still do not know if Patty Mills will come back (free agency) and Korver could fill the void.
