Rockets GM Daryl Morey tells Fox Sports that his team would like to bolster its frontcourt by signing Sammy Dalembert: “Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey acknowledged Thursday he is in negotiations with free agent center Samuel Dalembert. The Rockets have been working the free agent market to add an impact big man to their roster. Dalembert is 6-11 and 250 pounds. ‘We have interest in Sam,’ Morey said. ‘If it makes sense for him and us, we would love to have him. It’s in negotiations. Between the two of us looking for a fit. He’s got a lot of options and we’ll see if it makes sense here … I think he’s somebody who could add presence in the middle, rebounding, shot blocking that could help us out,’ Morey said. ‘That said I think our young guys are some guys that could develop and give us that as well.'”
