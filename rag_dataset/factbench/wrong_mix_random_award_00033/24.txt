Yep, a headline we never would have bet on. Mardy Fish is the 19th seed at the 2010 US Open. He’s in the bottom half of the draw (with Federer) and shares the same quarter as buddy Andy Roddick. Meanwhile, with his recent transformation (dedicating himself to fitness as he recovered from an injury sustained in the fall of 2009), we expect to see more pictures like this.
