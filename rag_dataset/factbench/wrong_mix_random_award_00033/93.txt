Mardy Fish hits a tee shot on the 17th hole during the final round of the American Century Celebrity Championship golf tournament at Edgewood Tahoe Golf Course in Stateline, Nev., Sunday, July 14, 2024.

Former tennis player Mardy Fish racked up 83 points to win the American Century Championship celebrity golf tournament on Sunday in Stateline, Nev.

Fish is now a two-time champion at the event, which he also won in 2020. He nearly matched the tournament record of 84 points set by former NFL quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver in 2010.

The modified Stableford scoring system is used at the American Century, meaning golfers get one point for a par, three for a birdie and six for an eagle. Points can also be lost, with two coming off the board for a double bogey or anything worse.

"I've won a few of the celebrity golf tournaments, and so I felt comfortable kind of coming into here having won in Dallas and in Maine," Fish said. "And this is the one you really want to win. American Century is really the Super Bowl, culminating the rest of the year."

Fish racked up 26 points on Sunday in the third and final round at Edgewood Tahoe.

Eighteen-year NHL veteran Joe Pavelski came in second with 79 points, followed by golfing legend Annika Sorenstam (68 points) and a pair of former major league pitchers in John Smoltz (64) and Derek Lowe (62), who finished in fourth and fifth, respectively.

Last year's champion, Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, did not participate in the tournament. He is currently with the U.S. men's basketball team as it prepares for the 2024 Paris Olympics.
