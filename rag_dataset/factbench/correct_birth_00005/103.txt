The Liverpool childhood home of Beatles legend Paul McCartney has sold for Â£150,000 at auction.

The terraced house in Western Avenue, Speke, was where the musician lived with his parents from 1947 until the mid-1950s.

McCartney's mother Mary worked as a midwife at the time, and the family are said to have been well known in the community.

The sale was held at Liverpool's Cavern Club where The Beatles often played.

Beatles guide Paul Beesley said: "This is an important house because it's where Paul spent his formative schoolboy years.
