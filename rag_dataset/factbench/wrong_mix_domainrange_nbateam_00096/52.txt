Ron Adams

The hire is expected to be announced today, and Adams will be on the bench for tonight’s game against Denver.

Adams served as an assistant under former Bulls coach Scott Skiles before Chicago general manager John Paxson moved Adams into a scouting role under new coach Vinny Del Negro. Adams also spent time as an assistant in Milwaukee, San Antonio and Philadelphia and was a player-personnel scout for Portland.

Adams began his coaching career at his alma mater, Fresno Pacific, and coached at the University of Cal-Santa Barbara, Fresno State and UNLV.

"We’ve been doing a pretty good job rebounding except for (giving up) offensive rebounds,” said Desmond Mason. "Against a team like this, even their smalls will crash the boards. Biedrins, that’s what he does. He scores a little on offense, but he’s relentless on the offensive boards.”

"He’s a smart defender,” Brooks said. "He knows how to put himself in the right position. He’s a long athlete who uses his hands well and anticipates well.

"One thing he’s learning as he goes is it’s a physical league. You might get that call in college, but you’re not getting that same type of respect. But he’s a smart kid who picks up things pretty quickly.”
