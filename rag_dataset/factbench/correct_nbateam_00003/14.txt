Former Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash is most recently remembered as a coach fired from the Brooklyn Nets. Admittedly so, there's some nephews in the NBA world who don't know the sort of player Nash was.

Before his coaching days, Nash played a vital role in Phoenix's rise to success in the 2000's, running point guard for Mike D'Antoni's "seven seconds or less" squad that nearly reached the NBA Finals on more than one occasion.

Nash's resume includes six-time All-Star, two-time league MVP, three-time 1st Team All-NBA, two-time 2nd Team All-NBA, and five-time assists champion accolades.

Nash spent majority of his career between the Suns and Dallas Mavericks, and now, he'll be inducting a good friend from his time with the Mavericks into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Dallas legend Dirk Nowitzki is part of the 2023 Class, and Nash will be assisted by Jason Kidd (the two prominent point guards during Nowitzki's tenure) in inducting him.

Nash himself was inducted in 2018.
