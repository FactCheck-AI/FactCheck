On top of that mini-reunion at this year's Vanity Fair Oscars after party brought back a lot of memories, Joe Jonas is here to help rekindle our hopes for a Camp Rock.

That's right, the DNCE frontman recently told Marie Claire that if he had things his way, a reunion would definitely be in the cards.

"If it made sense, sure. For all of us â€” Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it," he said. "Do the graduating days, make it kind of dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-rated film. We've joked around about the idea a couple times."

It's not exactly what you'd expect, but there's no denying that an on-screen reunion between the three of them and (hopefully) their oldest brother Kevin would be everything. And with nostalgia making a full-on TV comeback via Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life and Fuller House, we vote for a reboot of the trio's camp classic next! At this point, it's your move, Disney or perhaps Netflix.
