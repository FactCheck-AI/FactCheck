Sam Stosur has been keeping a very special secret, and what a secret-keeper she is.

The Australian tennis star is a new mum, after her partner Liz gave birth to the couple's first child, a daughter last month.

She shared the news on Instagram on Monday night along with a photo showing her smiling widely next to Liz, who is cradling their baby who they named Genevieve.

Stosur shared the photo along with the caption: "Life in lockdown during coronavirus has been challenging in many ways but personally it's been one of the most exciting and happy times of my life.

"On the 16th of June, my partner Liz gave birth to our beautiful little girl, Genevieve. It has been a whirlwind time but we could not imagine life without her now.

"We are absolutely in love with this little bundle and rolling with the happy chaos. We can't wait for what's to come and to watch little Evie grow up â€¦ Although not too quickly we hope!"

Among the first to congratulate the couple was Tennis Australia who said: "Congratulations Sam and Liz on the safe arrival of beautiful Evie, with love from the tennis family."

Asic Tennis commented: "Congratulations Sam!"

Next up it was the Australian Open's official Instagram account sharing their congratulations with the post: "Major congrats! Welcome to the world, Genevieve."

The US Open champion also reached a World Tennis Association ranking of fourth in 2011 but has since fallen to 97th.
