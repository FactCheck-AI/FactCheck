Thank you @festivaltvmonte_carlo for a great trip! Loved being there with this A team. Lots of laughs, blisters on our feet, and ate enough croissants to supply a bakery. See you next time.”

However, that’s not the real gist. The big news is the baby bump that Khalil was spotting. How can we miss that? The Young and the Restless star is expecting another baby.

Khalil did not announce her pregnancy, but fans saw her bump and they got really excited. They quickly took to her comment section to express their excitement.

They also mentioned how they were skeptical about her pregnancy with the way she was hiding her belly with purses and bags on the show.

Fellow cast member, Michelle Stafford (Phyllis Summers), also took to the comment section to write how she was so happy about the news. Fans and friends congratulated Khalil. However, she is yet to reveal her due date.

Christel Khalil tied the knot with Stephen Hensley in 2008 but the duo split in 2011. They share a son together, Michael, whom they welcomed on April 17th, 2010.

After the divorce, Khalil moved on to another relationship. However, she is currently dating Canadian businessman Sam Restagno, whom she is expecting her second child with.
