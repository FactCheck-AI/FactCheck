John Charles Carter, best known under his professional name as legendary actor Charlton Heston, would have turned 100 today (he was born in Wilmette, Illinois, on Oct. 4, 1923, and passed away in Beverly Hills on April 5, 2008, at age 84). Turner Classic Movies will celebrate Heston with lineups of his films each Wednesday in October.

Highlights among today’s lineup include the 1959 epic Ben-Hur, featuring Heston’s Best Actor Oscar-winning performance in the title role; the 1965 Western Major Dundee, with Heston again playing the titular character; and two films making their TCM premieres: the 1990 TV movie Treasure Island, with Heston as Long John Silver, and the 1968 World War II drama Counterpoint.
