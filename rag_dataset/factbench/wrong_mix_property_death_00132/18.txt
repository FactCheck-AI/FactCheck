PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island (CNN) -- Actor Anthony Quinn is dead. He was 86.

Quinn, 86, died Sunday morning at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where he had been for 17 days for treatment of pneumonia and respiratory failure, said Buddy Cianci, the mayor of Providence, Rhode Island, and a friend of the actor.

"He was a larger-than-life figure," Cianci said. "We're immensely sad here because he was part of our community." Quinn moved to nearby Bristol about seven years ago, Cianci said.

Cianci said Quinn's wife, Katherine, asked him to make the announcement. He and Quinn met in area restaurants "and we became pretty good friends over the course of the years."

Quinn had 13 children and was married several times, the last one to Katherine Benvin.

"He loved his wife, he loved his kids," Cianci said.

Quinn was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, into a poor family. As a boy, he moved with his family to East Los Angeles, where Quinn worked odd jobs as a butcher, a boxer, street corner preacher and a slaughterhouse worker.

Quinn won a scholarship to study architecture with Frank Lloyd Wright, with whom he developed a close relationship, Cianci said.

He appeared in more than 100 films, including "Zorba The Greek," "The Guns of Navarone" and "Viva Zapata!"
