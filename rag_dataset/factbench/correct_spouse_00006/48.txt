The poster couple for autism, Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy, has decided to end their relationship, and the pair chose to announce the news on Twitter. "Jenny and I have just ended our [five-year] relationship," Carrey wrote. "I'm grateful [for] the many blessings we've shared and I wish her the very best!" Carrey often wrote or spoke about the controversial link between autism, which McCarthy’s 7-year-old son has been diagnosed with, and vaccination. McCarthy’s first marriage, to actor and director John Asher, was reportedly strained by their son’s autism. The split was unexpected, and as recently as Valentine’s Day, Carrey hired a plane to write “J (heart) J” in the air.
