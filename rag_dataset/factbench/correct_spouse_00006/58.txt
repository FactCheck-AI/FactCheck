Jim Carrey has said he will never marry Jenny McCarthy.

The Eternal Sunshine actor - who has been married twice - has been dating McCarthy for a year but says they will never tie the knot.

Carrey said: "We're never getting married, but we're never getting divorced, which is fantastic.

"She's just a wonderful lady and much deeper than she's ever received credit for, and I'm very excited about her future."

Asked if he would at least give former Playboy playmate McCarthy a ring to cement their love, the 45-year-old actor replied: "I bought her a Chloe purse. Isn't that good enough?"

Carrey was previously married to actress Lauren Holly and has a 19-year-old daughter, Jane, with his first wife, Melissa Womer.

McCarthy filed for divorce from film director John Asher in August 2005, after six years of marriage. They have a four-year-old son, Evan.
