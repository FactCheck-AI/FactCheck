Hollywood star Jim posted the news on Twitter, saying he wished actress and model Jenny "the very best".

The 48-year-old - who started romancing the blonde in December 2005 - tweeted: "Jenny and I have just ended our five-year relationship, I'm grateful for the many blessings we've shared and I wish her the very best!"

People reports that Jenny released a statement saying she was "so grateful" for her years with the actor, and that she would maintain her relationship with his 22-year-old daughter Jane.

"I will continue to be in his daughter's life and will always keep Jim as a leading man in my heart," said the 37-year-old, who has a seven-year-old son from a previous relationship.
