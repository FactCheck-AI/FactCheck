Mike Myers just lined up an excellent new Netflix project.

Myers is set to star in a new half-hour comedy series in which he'll play multiple characters, Netflix announced on Wednesday per Variety. This will be a six-episode limited series that Myers is producing alongside Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me producer John Lyons and The Gong Show producer Jason Weinberg. Details about the title or the plot of the series were not made available.

This will be one of Myers' only film or television roles of the decade, with the actor taking on few projects in the years after the critical and financial disappointment The Love Guru. After a long absence, he took center stage in 2017 with The Gong Show, but in a bizarre twist, Myers hosted this game show revival entirely in character as a fictional comedian named Tommy Maitland. He wore prosthetics in every episode, and ABC did not even publicly admit that Myers was, in fact, Maitland until later on.

Myers, of course, previously starred on Saturday Night Live, but this Netflix series will be his first scripted show telling a continuous narrative, The Hollywood Reporter points out.
