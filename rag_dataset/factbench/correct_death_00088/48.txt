Overlooking Lake Monona in Madison, WI is the Monona Terrace. Originally designed by Frank Lloyd Wright (a Wisconsin native), it was rejected by a single vote in 1938. Wright continued to alter and refine his plan for the terrace until he died in 1959.

Plans for the terrace were resurrected in 1990, and the project was completed in 1997.

On top of the terrace is a memorial to the soul singer Otis Redding. On December 10, 1967, Redding was flying to Madison with his Stax Records backing group, the Bar-Kays, when their plane crashed into the icy waters of Lake Monona. Except for one member of the Bar-Kays, everyone aboard the plane died.

The crash came three days after Redding had recorded "Sitting On the Dock of the Bay," which would become his first #1 hit song. He was 26 years old.
