Living less than 70 of my footsteps to the shoreline of Lake Monona means December 10th is always noted.

In 1967 Otis Redding was killed in a plane crash on Lake Monona, the ‘lake of the rising sun’. The plane carrying Redding and his band crashed into icy waters near Madison. Just four miles from their destination at Madison’s Truax Field.
