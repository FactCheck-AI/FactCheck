The funeral of country music legend George Jones will be held at the famous Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville and is open to fans, it has been announced.

"George would have wanted his fans and friends everywhere to be able to come and pay their respects along with his family," publicist Kirt Webster said.

The ceremony will be held on Thursday, a day after a private visitation for family, friends and fellow performers.

Jones' hits included He Stopped Loving Her Today. He died on Friday aged 81.

Mr Webster said he died after being admitted to hospital for fever and irregular blood pressure.

In a statement, Jones' widow Nancy said: "Thanks to George's friends, fans, and loved ones for the outpouring of love at this terrible time. I love you all."
