The Democratic Party of Wisconsin has added Superbad to its growing list of film and TV reunion fundraisers.

Stars Jonah Hill (Seth), Michael Cera (Evan), Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Fogell aka McLovin), Seth Rogen (Officer Michaels; writer), Bill Hader (Officer Slater) and Martha MacIssac (Becca) are all participating, along with writer Evan Goldberg, director Greg Mottola, and producer Judd Apatow. Emma Stone, who played Jules in the film, has also been added to the event, Hill announced on Twitter.

The “Superbad: Cast Reunion & Watch Party,” taking place on Oct. 27 at 8 p.m. CT, will feature the cast and filmmakers of the popular 2007 coming-of-age comedy giving live commentary as they rewatch the movie with fans around the country.

Wisconsin remains a key battleground state in the 2020 presidential election between President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden. With the Superbad event taking place one week ahead of Nov. 3, Hill noted a “homestretch” urgency in his tweet announcing the event.

“If Trump wins Wisconsin, his path to an electoral college win dramatically increases. Your donation will go toward stopping Trump from winning back the White House,” reads the invite. Similar to other reunions hosted by the Wisconsin Democrats, a donation of any amount gives fans access to the watch party, which will be live-streamed once. (RSVP here.)

Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler, who has organized recent events with the West Wing, Princess Bride and Veep casts, says in a statement: “We are thrilled to have the cast of Superbad join us in the fight to defeat our super awful president. With the help of our talented guests, we know that we can win this election for Wisconsin and for the country. Laugh with us as we raise the funds and mobilize the volunteers we need to finish this race strong.”
