In a bid to promote joint economic ventures between his country and U.S. investors, and entice Americans to visit Croatia, President Stjepan Mesic traveled to California April 8-10, 2006. Mesic's trip to the West Coast also included meeting with some of the 50,000 Croatians in the San Francisco Bay area at a reception at the Croatian-American Cultural Center to inform them of the latest developments in Croatia's efforts towards EU and NATO membership. During his visit Mesic expressed his satisfaction with the level and quality of Croatian-U.S. cooperation. The President's itinerary also included speaking before the World Affairs Council in San Francisco on the role of small nations on the 21st century international political scene, an interview for the San Francisco Chronicle and a meeting with former U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz.

One of the highlights of Mesic's visit was a meeting with famed Napa Valley winemaker Miljenko Mike Grgich on April 9, 2006, with whom he planted a vine commemorating Roots of Peace efforts in Croatia - a campaign to replace mines with vines - in front of Grgich Hills Cellar in Rutherford, CA.
