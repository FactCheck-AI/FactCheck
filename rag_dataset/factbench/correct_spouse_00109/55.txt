Two years after swapping vows with CSI: NY actor Carmine Giovinazzo, Vanessa Marcil has pulled the plug on their union.

Filing divorce papers in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Marcil, 43, cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for her split from the actor, 38, according to TMZ. In her filing, Marcil petitions the court to order Giovinazzo to pay her attorney’s fees and award her spousal support.

Giovinazzao — who wed the actress in July 2010 — was Marcil’s second husband. She was married to ’80s star Corey Feldman from 1989-1993.

Former Beverly Hills, 90210 actress Marcil dated her costar, Brian Austin Green, from 1999-2003. They share a son, Kassius, 10. Green married Megan Fox in June 2010. Green, 39, and Fox, 26, are expecting their first child together.
