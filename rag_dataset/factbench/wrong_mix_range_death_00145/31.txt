One of my favorite people in the entire world died earlier today. Comedian, philosopher and poet, George Carlin died of heart failure at a hospital in Santa Monica, California. Carlin may not have been in a band, but he was metal as fuck! He was most famously know for his Seven Dirty Words routine, but the above routine may be my all time favorite.

Update: The New York Times wrote a great obituary to Carlin definitely worth checking out.

LONG LIVE GEORGE FUCKING CARLIN!
