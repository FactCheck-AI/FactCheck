The Tennessee Williams Society, named in honor of the famous American playwright and author, is the St. Louis Public Library Foundation’s special recognition society that honors those who demonstrate a leadership commitment to the St. Louis Public Library each year.

With gifts of $1,200 or more, the Tennessee Williams Society helps fund the Library's literacy programs that serve thousands of children and adults throughout the City of St. Louis each year.

Leadership gifts provided by Tennessee Williams Society Friends are increasingly important for the future of the St. Louis Public Library. With this continued support, the Library will maintain its role as one of the nation’s top urban libraries, providing programs that serve the St. Louis community and region for generations to come.
