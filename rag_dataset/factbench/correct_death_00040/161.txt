Ex-President Johnson died, July 31, at the residence of his daughter, Mrs. W. R. Brown, near Carter Station, Tennessee. On the 27th, when he left his home in Greenville, he was apparently in vigorous health; but soon after reaching his daughterÂ’s house, on the evening of the 28th, he was stricken with paralysis, which mainly affected his left side, and rendered him unconscious. He rallied occasionally, but finally passed away. Mr. Johnson was in his sixty-seventh year. We give his portrait on page 665.
