eBay, the world's top internet auctioneer, and Wells Fargo, the largest US online banker, said they would jointly operate a system that lets sellers take credit card payments over the web.

Wells Fargo will pay eBay an undisclosed amount for a 35 per cent stake in the venture, called Billpoint. eBay bought Billpoint, a provider of online payment services, for about $US86 million ($142 million) in May.
