The Mavericks have rarely been confused with the Bad Boy Detroit Pistons or any other thuggish team in NBA history.

But while they've been blown out in two of the three games in their first-round series against Oklahoma City, they've also shown they aren't afraid to get down and dirty.

Raymond Felton and the Thunder's Steven Adams both got technical fouls in the third quarter for giving each other forearm shots that basically served as a "welcome to the playoffs" moment for both of them.

"That's all in a game," Felton said. "Just because I'm 6-1 I ain't backing down from nothing. I'm not gonna let anybdoy hit me in my face and let that go.

"But whatever - it's over with now. I'm not gonna dwell on it. On to the next game. It happens. Games get chippy. Everybody fighting for something. Gets emotional, trash talking or whatever goes back and forth. That's all in the game."

There were other feisty moments, too. Salah Mejri got pulled to the ground once and also took a Serge Ibaka elbow to the midsection. He voiced his displeasure to the referees, but was basically met with a non-response.

It's playoff basketball. Time to put the hard hats on.
