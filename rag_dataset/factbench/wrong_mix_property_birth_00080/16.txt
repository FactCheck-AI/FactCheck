London: Serbian Nenad Zimonjic and his Australian partner Sam Stosur are the Wimbledon mixed doubles champions. They beat Max Mirnyi of Belarus and Chinese Tapei's Hao-Ching Chan 6-4, 6-2 at the All England Club.

It took less than an hour for the experienced No.15 seeds Zimonjic and Stosur to triumph against Mirnyi and Chan, reports Xinhua.

The first blow came when they broke Mirnyi's serve in the ninth game of the first set.

A double break in the second set, both on Chan's serve, ensured Zimonjic and Stosur were not troubled on their way to victory.

It's the second Wimbledon mixed doubles title for Stosur, having combined with Bob Bryan to triumph in 2008.
