A major global company has renewed the lease of its office at Kings Hill.

Infor, a leader in business cloud software, is headquartered in New York and has 17,300 employees worldwide.

It has more than 68,000 customers in more than 170 countries.

Its customers include the world’s top 20 aerospace companies, 17 of the top 20 global banks, nine of the top ten high tech companies and nine of the largest ten global hotel brands.

In the UK customers include BAE Air Systems, Transport for Greater Manchester, South Western Railways, Fullers Brewery, Vantage Power and Accor Hotels.

With almost 1,000 employees throughout the UK, Infor moved to Kings Hill in West Malling in 2004.

Caroline Binns, of Kings Hill developer Liberty Property Trust, said: “It is always good news when a tenant renews its lease multiple times.

“We are mindful that tenants have a choice and how important it is for us to provide a quality environment conducive to them retaining their talented people.”

It comes just months after Covéa Insurance renewed its lease on the site - believed to be the biggest office deal in the county for 18 months.
