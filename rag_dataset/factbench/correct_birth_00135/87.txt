English novelist, essayist, and critic George Orwell was born on June 25, 1903, near Gopal Sah High School, located in the city of Motihari, about 150 kilometres from Patna in Bihar.

Best known for the allegorical novella ‘Animal Farm’ and the dystopian novel ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four,’ his work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism.

Orwell’s father was a minor British official in the Indian Civil service; his mother, with French lineage, was the daughter of a teak merchant in Burma (Myanmar).
