Whereas Amazon has garnered customers of its cloud computing offering and Google unveiled AppEngine this week another, more likely suspect is entering the fray: EMC.

CEO Joe Tucci said this week that “there already is an EMC storage cloud.” He was referring, of course, to Mozy, the company’s online backup and recovery service, acquired in the buyout of Berkeley Data Systems.

“Tucci’s ambitions go far beyond simple, online backup,” Bill Snyder writes in Battle brewing in the cloud. “Like Amazon, EMC’s cloud will include both storage and computing resources.”

And while the timing is not yet clear, Snyder continues that, “EMC’s cloud play will focus on businesses through its computing and storage offerings, but the company sees an opening on the consumer front as well.”

Even still, Snyder is not altogether convinced that cloud computing’s success is a foregone conclusion.

“I’m not making any predictions here, but keeping an eye on this nascent trend is likely a good idea for investors as well as serious consumers of technology.”
