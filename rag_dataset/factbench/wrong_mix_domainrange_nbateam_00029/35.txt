Veteran NBA guard Luke Ridnour and his expiring contract are once again on the move, this time with the Oklahoma City Thunder shipping him to the Toronto Raptors, reports the Oklahoman’s Darnell Mayberry.

According to the report, Oklahoma City also sent cash in the deal, creating a $2.85 million trade exception. Toronto sent the draft rights of Tomislav Zubcic to the Thunder to complete the deal.

The Raptors selected Zubcic with the 56th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft.

Ridnour’s journey around the league started last Wednesday when he was traded from the Orlando Magic, where he spent one season, to the Memphis Grizzlies.

Less than 24 hours later, Ridnour was traded to the Charlotte Hornets from Memphis for veteran forward Matt Barnes.

That deal was flipped when Charlotte sent Ridnour and a 2016 second-round pick to the Oklahoma City Thunder in exchange for Jeremy Lamb.

Ridnour is scheduled to make $2.75 million next season and that money becomes guaranteed if he is not waived on or before July 10.
