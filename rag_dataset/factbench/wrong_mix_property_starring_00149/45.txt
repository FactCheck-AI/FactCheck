Biography

Vincent Price is the 10th President of Duke University, where he is also Walter Hines Page Professor of Public Policy and Political Science in the Sanford School of Public Policy and Trinity College of Arts and Sciences.

A leading global expert on public opinion, social influence, and political communication, President Price came to Duke in 2017. Since arriving on campus, he has turned his attention to the future of the university, developing a strategic vision focused on five core principles: empowering people, transforming education, building community, forging partnerships, and engaging a global network. He has also overseen a series of major new initiatives at Duke — including a comprehensive commitment to racial equity, continued strategic advancement of the arts, implementing next-generation residential programs, investing in Duke science and technology, and broadening and deepening engagement with Durham and the surrounding region.

Under Price’s leadership, Duke has continued to build on its global reputation for innovation and service. President Price also oversaw the launch of the undergraduate program at Duke Kunshan University, a unique, joint venture liberal arts university in Kunshan, China. Closer to home, the university is helping to grow the already-thriving research and technology ecosystem in the Research Triangle region and finding new opportunities for experiential and team-based learning across disciplines. President Price also oversees Duke Health — a leading academic medical center — and one of the most successful collegiate athletics programs in the nation.

Prior to coming to Duke, Price served as Provost of the University of Pennsylvania and was the Steven H. Chaffee Professor in the Annenberg School for Communication and Professor of Political Science in the School of Arts and Sciences. As Provost and chief academic officer, he advanced initiatives to diversify the faculty and expand interdisciplinary research; guided the development of new forms of teaching and learning, both in the classroom and in the digital world; expanded the University’s global presence, including the launch of the Penn Wharton Center in Beijing; and enhanced arts and culture on campus, shepherding the creation of the Sachs Program for Arts Innovation. He led Penn’s role as one of the first partners with Coursera, the online open learning platform, and served as Chair of Coursera’s University Advisory Board. He came to Penn in 1998 after 11 years at the University of Michigan, where he was Chair of the Department of Communication Studies and a Faculty Associate of the Center for Political Studies.

President Price’s Public Opinion (Sage, 1992) has been published in six languages and taught in courses around the world. His work has been widely cited on such topics as the impact of political polls, the effects of TV news coverage, and the factors that shape public opinion. His research, funded by grants from the Pew Charitable Trusts, National Science Foundation, and National Institutes of Health, has explored the role of online discussion in shaping public knowledge and opinion. The former editor-in-chief of Public Opinion Quarterly, the leading journal of public opinion research, Price has held visiting appointments at the University of Paris-Sorbonne and the University of Amsterdam, and has lectured widely at universities around the world.

A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Price earned his PhD (1987) and MA (1985) in Communication from Stanford University and a BA magna cum laude (1979) in English from the University Honors Program at Santa Clara University. Born and raised in southern California, Price and his wife Annette are the proud parents of two adult children. In their free time, they can often be found walking their doodles, Cricket and Marlowe, on the Al Buehler Trail in Duke Forest.
