The Portland Trail Blazers re-acquired Steve Blake because he's a capable primary reserve at the point guard position. They also re-acquired Steve Blake because he doesn't like getting pushed around by anyone...a quality the Blazers need to learn.

Exhibit A in the case of Steve Blake v. The World: his reaction when Denver power forward Kenneth Faried (who has 5 inches and 55 pounds on Blake) forearmed him in the back during Portland's Sunday evening victory against the Nuggets:

Double technicals were called on the play, along with a Flagrant 1 for Blake.

You may recall that Blake got double-chucked by Chris Paul and Blake Griffin in similar fashion during Saturday afternoon's loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. That was also Blake's worst game of the season. On this night he made pretty clear he's just not having it.

Gotta love that guy.
