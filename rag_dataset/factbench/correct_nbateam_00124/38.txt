SEATTLE (AP) - Former Rainier Beach High School star and current Atlanta Hawks guard Jamal Crawford has announced plans for a charity basketball game to be played at the University of Washington on Dec. 15.

Crawford made the announcement on Tuesday and said players confirmed for the event include Kevin Durant, John Wall, Brandon Roy and Jason Terry.

Along with Durant, Nick Collison and Jeff Green were announced as participants. All three played for the Seattle SuperSonics before the team moved to Oklahoma City.

Other notable players include Baron Davis, LaMarcus Aldridge, Spencer Hawes, Nate Robinson and Brandon Roy.

This will be the second charity game to take place in the Seattle area this year after a similar event in July at Key Arena.
