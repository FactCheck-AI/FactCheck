ATLANTA ? The Hawks and Golden State Warriors have completed a deal that sends guard Jamal Crawford to Atlanta for guards Acie Law and Speedy Claxton.

Crawford provides the Hawks with depth and flexibility at the guard spot. Starting point guard Mike Bibby and backup combo guard Flip Murray are both unrestricted free agents after helping Atlanta reach the second round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.

The deal was reached after Crawford signed paperwork indicating he won?t opt out of his contract and become a free agent. He is due to make nearly $20 million the next two years.
