After five seasons with the L.A. Clippers, winning two out of his three Sixth Man of The Year awards, Jamal Crawford was recently traded to provide cap room for free agent signing Danilo Gallinari.

Crawford was sent to the Atlanta Hawks in a three-team trade, but was quickly bought out by the team. The Hawks did not want his two-years and $28 million on their books, and Crawford did not want to play for Atlanta.

That opened up a chance for many teams who wanted Crawford at a reduced price. Many suitors emerged, with most reports underlining the Lakers, Cavaliers, and Warriors. However, Crawford is going somewhere else.

The Timberwolves has now emerged as an intriguing force in the tough Western Conference with All-Star Jimmy Butler and young studs Andrew Wiggins and Karl Anthony-Towns. With Crawford in tow, Minnesota now has one of the most reliable bench producers in NBA history.

Last season, Crawford averaged 12.3 points per game on 41.6 percent shooting from the field. He also shot 36 percent from the three, making almost 1.5 threes per game.
