Dwight Howard might soon be making a return to the NBA.

The veteran center is meeting with the Golden State Warriors next week, sources told The Athletic's Shams Charania.

Howard, 37, played 60 games with the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2021-22 season. He won a title with L.A. in 2020 while in a reserve role. Howard spent his latest professional campaign in Taiwan with the Taoyuan Leopards.

On the cusp of entering his 19th season in the league, Howard has notified prospective teams this offseason that he is in shape and ready to contribute in any role, Charania adds.

The Warriors have been exploring adding a reserve veteran big man during the offseason, Charania adds.

Golden State has prioritized adding veterans since Mike Dunleavy Jr. took over as general manager in June. The team acquired veteran Chris Paul in a move that sent youngster Jordan Poole to the Washington Wizards, re-signed Draymond Green on a four-year, $100-million deal, and signed Cory Joseph and Dario Saric.

The Warriors finished with a 44-38 record last campaign. They were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs by the Lakers after winning the NBA championship the season prior.
