Tom Cruise did “not see” the separation coming when actress Katie Holmes filed for divorce.

The star, 61, and Holmes sent shockwaves among fans over the news of separation over Scientology fears.

The Mission Impossible star and The Giver actress, 45, married in a Scientology ceremony in 2006, shortly after their daughter Suri was born.

However, their relationship deteriorated over time, with sources suggesting that the Phone Booth alum felt threatened by the Church of Scientology and worried that it would manipulate her daughter against her.

As a result, Holmes was awarded full custody of Suri in their divorce agreement, leading to Tom becoming increasingly disconnected from his daughter's life.

According to Ron Miscavige, father of Scientology leader David Miscavige, the marriage of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes began to show signs of trouble when members of the Church of Scientology moved into their Los Angeles home.

Ron alleged that the church's staff relocated to the couple's residence to ensure Cruise received proper care and supervision, potentially exerting significant influence over their household and contributing to the cracks in their relationship.

Speaking to the Daily Mail, he said: "That didn’t sit so well with Katie, of course, and it hurt the marriage." Ron said that Katie was afraid her daughter might have called off contact with her under Scientology’s "disconnection" policy.

On June 29 2012, the now separated couple has announced the disheartening news of their separation.

The Oblivion star said he was "deeply saddened" by his ex-wife’s decision to divorce him.

A spokesperson for the actor said at the time: "Kate has filed for divorce and Tom is deeply saddened and is concentrating on his three children."
