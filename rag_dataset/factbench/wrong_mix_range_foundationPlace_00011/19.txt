Mountain View is bounded on the north by the San Diego Arizona Eastern Railroad (which is now shared by the San Diego Trolley), on the south by National Avenue and extending southward to the Delta Street, Interstate 805, on the east and State Highway 15 on the west. The neighborhood is separated from the surrounding areas by two major freeways and two large cemeteries: Greenwood, and a portion of Mount Hope. The neighborhood became known as “Mountain View” due to the unobstructed view of San Miguel Mountain to the east.
