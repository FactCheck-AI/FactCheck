The World Health Organisation's top staff has been replaced by an entirely new team. The announcement came on 21 July--the day Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, former prime minister of Norway, assumed office as the WHO's new director general.

Since January Dr Brundtland's transition team has been working to mastermind a radical break with the WHO's tarnished past in terms of a new leadership, structure, priorities, and operations. Despite nervous grumbling about the “heavy input” from headquarters and a lack of transparency in the “Scandinavian-Anglo-Saxon mafia” the transition team seems to have achieved its goal.

The names of the new appointees to the WHO's cabinet were unveiled in Dr Brundtland's first teleconference address to the WHO's 3500 staff around the world on the day of her arrival.

It is rumoured that the Norwegian government has placed a sizeable sum ($30m; £19m) at the WHO's disposal to ease the departure of staff whose services will no longer be required.
