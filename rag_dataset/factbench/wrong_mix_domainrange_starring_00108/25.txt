Pitch Perfect star Anna Kendrick and Trainwreck's Bill Hader have been dating in secret for over a year, according to reports. The pair, who starred in the 2019 Christmas film Noelle together have been able to keep their relationship secret during the pandemic, but a source recently revealed the romance.

According to the source the pair got together some time in late 2020 and have managed to keep the relationship out of the public eye ever since then with increased privacy during the pandemic.

"Anna has been dating Bill quietly for over a year," a source told People. "They met years ago. She's hosted Saturday Night Live and they've done a movie together, but they got together well after the movie.

"They are both very private people, and with the pandemic it was easy to keep it quiet," the source explained, adding, "They're both hysterical so they must keep each other laughing all of the time. She's really, really happy."

Previously Hader was in a relationship with The O.C. star Rachel Bilson, but the pair split in July 2020, six months after taking their relationship public on the red carpet of the Golden Globes. Hader was also previously married to film director Maggie Carey with whom he shares three children, Hannah Kathryn, 12, Hayley Clementine, 7, and Harper, 9.
