Mel Torme, the jazz and pop singer whose warm vocals earned him the unwanted title "the Velvet Fog," and the co-writer of the Christmas classic that celebrates "chestnuts roasting on an open fire," died Saturday. He was 73.

Torme, who had suffered what was described as a mild stroke in August 1996, died of complications from that stroke after being rushed from his Beverly Hills home to the University of California, Los Angeles, medical center, said his publicist, Rob Wilcox.

Torme's wife, Ali, and five children were at his side when he died, Wilcox said.

Besides his singing and prolific songwriting, Torme's career included acting.

Torme, who began his singing career on radio at age 4, preferred jazz singing to the crooning that brought him his nickname.

"It really wasn't until the end of my high school days, in 1943, that I determined to be a jazz singer," he said. "Then I got sidetracked. (His manager) felt the way to the gold was for me to become a crooner.

"For a long period I was singing mushy, sentimental songs. I began to be called the Velvet Fog. I never liked it."
