Widely considered America’s foremost dramatist, he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize four times and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936. His masterpiece, LONG DAY’S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT (produced posthumously in 1956), is at the apex of a long string of great plays, including BEYOND THE HORIZON (1920), ANNA CHRISTIE (1922), STRANGE INTERLUDE (1928), AH! WILDERNESS (1933), and THE ICEMAN COMETH (1946). O’Neill passed away at the age of 65 in November 1953.
