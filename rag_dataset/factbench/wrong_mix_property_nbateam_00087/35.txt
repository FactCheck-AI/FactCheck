CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Tribune is reporting on its Web site that the Chicago Bulls have agreed to trade center Tyson Chandler to the New Orleans Hornets for veteran forward P.J. Brown and swingman J.R. Smith.

Chandler tells the newspaper ``it's a great basketball opportunity to play with a bunch of young, up-and-coming guys. That's the thing I'm excited about.''

The deal can't become official until July 12th, when the league's free agent signing moratorium ends.

Chandler averaged just over five points and nine rebounds last season after signing a six-year contract worth about 60 (m) million dollars.

Earlier this week four-time Defensive Player of the Year Ben Wallace agreed to contract terms with the Bulls. A person within the N-B-A tells The Associated Press the free-agent center is getting a four-year pact worth around 60 (m) million dollars.
