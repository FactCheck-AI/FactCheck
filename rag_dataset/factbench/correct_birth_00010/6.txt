NEW YORK (WABC) -- A new bill could soon reintroduce December 4th as "Jay-Z Day" in the Big Apple.

New York City Councilmembers introduced a legislation earlier this month to recognize the Brooklyn-born MC and mogul's birthday as its own official day in New York City.

According to the resolution, the bill would celebrate the "Book of HOV" subject's "legendary status as a masterful MC and lyricist and as an innovative entrepreneur."

The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, who coined the iconic line, "I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man," recently took over his home borough over the summer with the record-setting "Book of HOV" exhibit at Brooklyn Public Library.

According to the library, the career-spanning tribute brought in more than 600,000 visitors -- a 74% increase in the Central Library branch's attendance.

Limited-edition library cards exclusively available across Brooklyn Public Library branches sparked a whopping increase in memberships in addition to thousands of attendees.

The library also had nearly 11,000 patrons during the exhibit's final day, which fittingly fell on Jay-Z's birthday.
