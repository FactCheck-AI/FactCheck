Timothy Zachery Mosley (born March 10, 1972), better known by his stage name Timbaland, is an American record producer and rapper from Norfolk, Virginia. After a DJing career during his teenage years, Timbaland began his producing career strictly for R&B artists. In the early to mid-1990s, he produced for artists such as Jodeci and Sista, before having his mainstream breakthrough by producing the majority of both Aaliyah's second album One in a Million and Ginuwine's debut album Ginuwine...the Bachelor. While Timbaland was initially producing for R&B artist, his trademark sound was very much rooted in hip hop, and he was isntrumental in blurring the distinction between hip hop and R&B production. In 1997, he produced the entirety of Missy Elliott's debut album, Supa Dupa Fly, in addition to releasing his first album alongside rapper Magoo, Welcome to Our World. In the late 1990s, his hip hop production sound would become very influential and common as he produced for many high profile hip hop artists such as Jay Z, Nas and The LOX. Timbaland released his debut solo album, Tim's Bio: Life from da Bassment, in 1998.

In 2002, Timbaland produced the hit single "Cry Me a River" by Justin Timberlake, going on to produce most of Timberlake's subsequent albums and their hit singles. In 2004, he founded his own record label, Mosley Music Group, which has released successful albums by Nelly Furtado and OneRepublic. In 2005, Timbaland released a solo album, Shock Value, which was followed by Shock Value II two years later.

Aside from the aforementioned artists, Timbaland's production credits from the 2000s forward include work with Ludacris, Bubba Sparxxx, Madonna, Rihanna, Brandy, Drake and Rick Ross, among others.
