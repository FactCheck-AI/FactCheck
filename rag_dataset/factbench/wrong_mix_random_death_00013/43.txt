Dialogue: Broadacre City. Exhibition Of Frank Lloyd Wright. Italian Studio of Art History, May 15, 1951. As previewed at Gimbel Brothers, Philadelphia, APA., January 1951.

Author: Wright, Frank Lloyd; Stonorov, Oskar

Description: Produced for the exhibition Sixty Years of Living Architecture held in Florence Italy, 1951. Text of a conversation between Frank Lloyd Wright and Oskar Stonorov concerning Broadacre City. A Preview of the exhibition was held in Philadelphia (January 1951). The world wide tour opened in Palazzo Strozzi Florence, Italy (June 1951).

Frank Lloyd. Wright: Oskar, what is that you wish me to clarify on the idea of Broadacre City?

Oskar Stonorov: Mr. Wright, after wandering through this exhibition of earlier buildings of yours, people have now reached this model of the landscape of a modern city you call Broadacre City: an example of free planning for Usonians. Samuel Butler suggested the name "Usonia" for our country, the United States. You have adopted the name. Just what is the meaning of this great model? For one thing, people will want to know why you put skyscrapers next to cottages on acre lots, Mr. Wright.

Frank Lloyd Wright: To begin with, this model of Broadacre City is an attack upon the cultural lag of our society. The model you see before you attempts to show how a more humane use of the power gained by use of our vast Machine leverage could be used to free the citizen from urbanism and war. That could be accomplished by way of the citizen's own Architecture. Were the Machine put in place, today, its place would be the hand of the creative Architect. Or, let us better say, Architecture creative. Democracy can arrive no other way! We might realize (seeing this model) that the right buildings for the right people in the right places would naturally be harmonious. Each building, though differing totally, could easily-because naturallybe complementary to the other. That is really what you are seeing here...

Description: Original poster published for the exhibition Sixty Years of Living Architecture, The Work of Frank Lloyd Wright, held "in het ahoy' gebouw" (in the Ahoy Building), Rotterdam, Holland, 1952. The traveling exhibition consisted of models, photographs and original drawings. A Preview of the exhibition was held in Philadelphia at Gimbel Brothers Gallery in January, 1951.

From the Rotterdam Catalog: Ter gelegenheid van hot het honderdjarig bestaan van de Acedemie van Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen is het mogelijk geworden met bijdragen van Rijk, Gemeente en stadgenoten deze tentoonstelling in Rotterdam to houden. (On the occasion of the centenary of the Academy of Visual Arts and Technical Sciences, it has become possible with contributions from the State, Municipality and fellow citizens to hold this exhibition in Rotterdam.)

Oud is bereid geweest zijn bemiddeling to verlenen om deze tentoonstelling noor Rotterdam te krijgen en belostte zich op verzoek van Frank Lloyd Wright met de supervisie de Rotterdamse tentoonstelling. (Architect J. J. P. Oud was willing to mediate in getting this exhibition to Rotterdam and, at the request of Frank Lloyd Wright, took over the supervision of the Rotterdam exhibition.)

De inrichting word verzorgd door de ontwerper B. H. Wissing. (The interior is provided by the designer B. H. Wissing.)

The poster was designed by "Wissing - Beger," Benno Wissing and Jan A. Begeer. The design is a montage of the S. C. Johnson Research Tower which is overprinted with a reversed plot plan for the Auldbrass Plantation, which was on display at the exhibition. (See Switzerland Catalog, Cover and p.88.)

The poster was not printed in the standard four color process. The vignettes (dark to light blends) were not achieved with a dot pattern but possibly by a rubber transfer or another process. We identified eight distinct colors: Dark and light olive, dark and light gray, black, pink (or magenta), yellow and dark green. It also appears that they may have used a photogravure process.

Wissing and Begeer were close friends and colleages. From 1949 to 1966 Benno Wissing worked as a designer for the Boymans Van Beuningen Museum in Rotterdam. Begeer's father was an art critic. They collaborated on many projects.

Author: Wright, Frank Lloyd

Description: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. A pamphlet describing the Usonian House that was built on the grounds of the Future Guggenheim Museum as part of the exhibition: Sixty Years of Living Architecture. "To say the original of this Usonian house, planted by myself on the good earth of the Chicago prairie as early as 1900 or earlier, was the first truly democratic expression in Architecture of our Democracy would start a controversy with professional addicts who believe Architecture has no political (therefore no social) significance. So, let's say that the Spirit of Democracy - freedom of the common man to grow to be an individual - took hold of the house as it then was, took off the attic and the porch, pulled out the basement, and made a single spacious, harmonious unit of living room, dining room and kitchen, with appropriate entry conveniences...

Usonian Exhibition Dining Chair, 1953. Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright for the Usonian Exhibition House exhibited in "Sixty Years of Living Architecture: The Work of Frank Lloyd Wright", at The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum exhibition grounds, New York, 22 October - 29 November 1953. For the retrospective of Frank Lloyd Wright's work in 1953, Wright built a fully furnished ''Usonian House'' and pavilion in the museum gardens. The house was described in a New York Times article as a ''fusion of architecture and furnishings, the blending of indoors and out.'' These two chairs were designed and built specifically for the exhibition house. Wright later used the same model for the Trier Residence, Iowa, 1956. Oak plywood, 37 inches high. Manufactured by Plycraft Products. (Sotheby's description. Sale date December 2003. Sold for $24,000 each plus buyer's premium.)

Usonian Library Table and Chair, Circa 1953. Christie's, London, April 2008. The table of was pitch pine, the chair of mahogany laminate. Table 27 in. high; 72 in. wide; 30 in. deep. Chair 37¼ in. high; 18½ in. wide; 19½ in. deep. Notes: Examples of the chair design were first exhibited at the Usonian Pavilion of the "Sixty Years of Living Architecture exhibition", New York, 1953. The model was subsequently incorporated in other interiors including the Paul Trier house, Des Moines, Iowa, 1956. (Christie's description. The set sold for $23,311 plus buyer's premium.)

New York Usonian Exhibition House and Pavilion opening reception photographs, October 22,1953. Photographed by Pedro Guerrero. Built on the site for the Guggenheim Museum. Contact sheet 8 x 10, twelve images each 2.25 x 2.25. See twelve images. The 1953 New York Usonian Exhibition House (S.369) and The 1956 Trier Residence (S.398). The Trier Residence is based on the Usonian Exhibition House (S.369) that was built in 1953 on the site for The Guggenheim Museum. The Trier Residence was the second home to utilize this floor plan. The first being the Feiman Residence (S.371). Wright's initial drawing of the home shows that he conceived the Trier Residence as a Usoniam Automatic, constructed of 12 x 24" concrete blocks. The working drawings specify the home to be constructed of brick. The Triers elected to use brick, and then substituted brick tile, to save construction costs. The 4 x 12" size remained consistent with Wright's original dimensions. The Trier's original floor plan created approximately 1740 square feet of living space, not including the Work Shop. The Living Room occupied thirty percent of the living space... Sixty Years of Living Architecture (New York).

LaSalle St., Chicago. Oct. 16, 1956. For Immediate Release. First view of Frank Lloyd Wright's Mile-High Building. Shown for the first time Tuesday (Oct. 16) was this 22-foot visualization of mile-high building proposed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright for Chicago. Details of the mammoth structure will be explained by Wright at a dinner in his honor to be held Wednesday (Oct. 17) at the Hotel Sherman. The giant visualization was prepared by Wright and apprentice architects at Taliesin, unique architectural school conducted by Mr. And Mrs. Wright at their Spring Green, Wis. Home. The dinner is being sponsored by the Frank Lloyd Wright Endowment Fund for the perpetuation of Taliesin." Clipping on verso: Stamped "Feb 4, 1959". "That Mile-High Skyscraper? - Famed architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed in 1956 to build it in Chicago. He said it would be 528 stories tall, could hold 100,000 people, would cost about $100 million. The "eighth wonder of the world" was to be erected of steel and glass, with floors extending outward from a central core like branches from a tree trunk. Wright's design drew jeers and cheers. The architect insisted the structure was "practical and expedient." Today, more than two years after Wright bared his daring idea, the mile-high building is no further along than a drawing. A spokesman for Wright says no group is currently interested in building or backing it." Clipping on verso: Stamped "Apr 9, 1959". "Here's sketch of mile-high skyscraper as envisioned for Chicago by Frank Lloyd Wright." Acquired from the archives of the Chicago Sun Times.

S#: 1147.75.0117 Cary Caraway was president of the Frank Lloyd Wright Day. Jesse Claude (Cary) and Frances Caraway, were both Taliesin apprentices in the 1930/40s. Cary was an apprentice from 1935-1942. In 1954 the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that Wright owed $10,000 in back taxes on Taliesin. For years he had argued that Taliesin was primarily a school and therefore tax exempt. He was so mad he threatened to destroy Taliesin and move from the state. Cary Caraway, suggested that Wright's friends express their appreciation and take up a collection. Mary Lescohier and Helen Groves made it happen. On February 10, 1955, 380 supporters gathered in the Great Hall of the U.W. Memorial Union for a tribute, the Monona Terrace Testimonial Banquet. Wright took the opportunity to display the new Monona Terrace model. At the end of the program, he received a check for $10.000.
