The Last Action Hero

“Way before multiverses became a Hollywood staple, Schwarzenegger went meta, playing an action-movie hero yanked into the real world. Packed with sly mischief, this colossal caper features cameos from iconic movie characters (the T-1000, Basic Instinct’s Catherine Tramell), in-jokes (look out for a hilarious guest appearance from Sylvester Stallone) and even the rare sight of Arnold performing Shakespeare.” —Nick de Semlyen, author of The Last Action Heroes
