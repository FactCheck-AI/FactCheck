A U.S. business software maker is buying Janna Systems Inc. of Toronto for about $1.4-billion in stock.

Siebel Systems Inc., based in San Mateo, Calif., said it has agreed to offer 0.497 of an exchangeable share of a Canadian subsidiary for each Janna share. Janna, which makes financial services software, said the bid values its stock at $65 a share, given the closing price of Siebel on Monday.

"Janna's customers and employees will significantly benefit from the combined resources and technologies brought to the table by both parties," William Tatham, Janna's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.

"We believe that becoming part of the clear global market leader will accelerate the realization of a definitive standard for e-business in financial services."

Holders of 29 per cent of Janna's stock and options have agreed to tender to the offer, which requires shareholder and regulatory approval.

Janna made a profit of $3.8-million or 23 cents a share on revenue of $19.2-million last year. However, it made a profit of $349,000 or 2 cents a share on revenue of $18.9-million in the first six months of this year.

Siebel made a profit of $122.1-million (U.S.) or 54 cents a share on revenue of $790.9-million last year.

Janna has agreed to pay a break fee of up to $30.15-billion to Siebel if the deal falls apart under certain circumstances. However, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.

The exchangeable shares of Siebel's Canadian subsidiary can be swapped for an equivalent number of Siebel shares at any time within five years, Siebel said.

Upon completion of the deal, Mr. Tatham will become vice-president and general manager of Siebel Systems institutional finance business unit for Siebel Financial Services, the company said.
