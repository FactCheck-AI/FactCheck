The Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, yesterday vowed to push post office privatisation through parliament by the end of next month. Mr Koizumi said he was "determined" to go ahead with privatisation which, by 2017, would turn Japan Post's Â£1.7 trillion in assets into the world's biggest private bank. "Since I took office I have been pressing for wide-ranging structural reforms ... in order to revive and move our country forward," he said. But the opposition leader, Seiji Maehara, accused the prime minister of having an unhealthy obsession with postal reform.
