Cecilia Cheung's manager has rubbished rumours that the Hong Kong actress is getting back together with her ex-husband, actor Nicholas Tse.

According to reports, rumours of the pair's reconciliation went rampant after fans speculated that Tse, 42, and Cheung, 43, met up while they were in Australia.

Tse was recently spotted with their son Lucas in Melbourne while Cheung was seen with a fan in Australia.

Addressing the rumours in an interview with Hong Kong media, Cheung's manager said that the Shaolin Soccer star was actually in Australia to visit relatives.

"Cecilia used to study in Australia, and she has lots of relatives and friends who live there," she said.

The manager added if Cheung and Tse were to get back together, they would announce it themselves on social media and not through media reports.

"I understand that many people want to see them together, but I can say with certainty that at this moment, (they) have not seen each other," she said.

Tse and Cheung tied the knot in 2006 and have two sons together. However, their marriage did not work out and they divorced in 2011.

Tse is currently in a relationship with Chinese singer Faye Wong.

On July 12, the actor told reporters to "stop messing with us" after a report claimed that he and Wong have broken up amicably after realising they were incompatible.

Tse and Wong started dating in the late 1990s but separated in 2002.

They started seeing each other again in 2014 and have since kept their relationship low profile.
