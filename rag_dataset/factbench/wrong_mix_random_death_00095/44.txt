The park commemorates the achievements of Baron Sir Ferdinand Von Mueller.

Baron Sir Ferdinand von Mueller was a pharmacist, botanist and explorer who migrated to South Australia from Rostock, Germany, in 1847. He explored vast areas of the continent, contributing greatly to the botanical knowledge of Australia. This work included a survey of the forests of Western Australia. Von Mueller was created Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George by Queen Victoria and appointed Baron by the King of Wurttemburg.

He was a Fellow of the Royal Society and in his time was probably the most famous scientist in the Southern Hemisphere. He died in 1896 in Victoria.
