Banquet speech

Guglielmo Marconi’s speech at the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm, December 10, 1909

Your Royal Highnesses, Your Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen

I thank Mr. Hildebrand for the very kind but too flattering remarks that he has made of myself and of my work in Wireless Telegraphy.

I believe that one perhaps of the least thought of advantages enjoyed by the winner of the Nobel Prize is that he is asked to visit Sweden and thereby given an opportunity of appreciating the illustrious count of Linné, Schéele, Berzelius, and Arrhenius.

Thanks to the high standing which science has for so long attain and to the impartiality of the Nobel Prize Committee, the Nobel Prize for Physics is rightly considered everywhere as the highest reward within the reach of workers in that branch of Natural Philosophy.

I am also glad to have this opportunity of expressing my high appreciation of the honour extended to me many years ago by the Royal Swedish Academy of Science by enrolling me amongst its members. You will also allow me to thank the Academy for inviting me to lecture in Stockholm, for its hospitality, and for the opportunity afforded me for admiring the charm of your people and the beauty of your country.

Your Royal Highnesses, Your Excellencies. Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the honour to ask you to drink to the health of Sweden and to the continued happiness and prosperity of the Swedish nation.
