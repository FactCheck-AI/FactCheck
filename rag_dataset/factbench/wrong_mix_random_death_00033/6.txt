Long before she was dubbed “Queen Bey” or “Sasha Fierce” Beyoncé Knowles-Carter spent her childhood and formative teenage years in Houston’s Third Ward neighborhood. Since then, she has sold over 100 million records, won 20 Grammy Awards, and performed all over the world. The international icon is headed home to Houston next week for the final leg of her Formation World Tour.

Houstonians know Beyoncé rarely visits Htown without making some appearances at some of her favorite spots around town. We put together a list of some of her known hometown hangouts:

Menil Collection

Mrs. Carter made a stop at the acclaimed Menil Collection this past May with her mother Tina and sister Solange. The Menil Collection is one of the most significant art collections of the twentieth century, consisting of nearly 15,000 works dating from the Paleolithic era to the present day. It's also free to visit!

The Breakfast Klub

Beyoncé made a stop at The Breakfast Klub in Midtown in 2010 and 2013. The acclaimed restaurant specializes in Katfish & Grits and Wings & Waffles and has been named one of the best breakfast spots in the nation.

Pappasitos Cantina

Queen Bey couldn’t pass up the opportunity to get some Tex-Mex at Pappasito’s Cantina in 2013. The restaurant has been voted “Number One Mexican Restaurant” repeatedly in publications across Texas. The cantina serves up sizzling platters of the tastiest fajitas and margaritas this side of the Rio Grande.

BB’s Café

This past May Beyoncé stopped at BB’s Café in Montrose after her Toyota Center concert. BB’s offers up Gulf Coast cuisine and New Orleans-inspired fare with a Texas twist.

Max's Wine Dive

Queen Bey showed up to Max's Wine Dive with Jay-Z and family in 2014. The restaurant is an upscale dive bar offering a standout wine list, late-night comfort food and a Texas-proud jukebox. She may have stopped by for some of their nationally ranked fried chicken and lobster tail!
