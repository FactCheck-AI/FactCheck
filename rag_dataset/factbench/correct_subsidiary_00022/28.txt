Today we completed the EqualLogic acquisition, a leading provider of high-performance storage area network (SAN) solutions designed for virtualization and ease-of-use. The purchase extends Dell's leadership in simplifying IT for customers.

Customers face extreme challenges with data growth. Storage solutions that use existing infrastructure, install in minutes not days, manage themselves, can grow easily as needs increase and plug into the virtualized IT ecosystem will help businesses with their storage needs. EqualLogic provides these storage solutions and that's the incredible value that Dell will now be able to deliver to our customers. With Dell's PartnerDirect channel, we will unleash the power of iSCSI and virtualization to redefine the economics of storing and processing data.

Dell plans to preserve and build on EqualLogic's successful channel program in addition to offering products directly from Dell. Starting today in the U.S. and ultimately around the world, current EqualLogic partners will be enrolled into PartnerDirect and are eligible for Dell's newest certificationâ€”Enterprise Architecture. Certification requirements and benefits are modeled after EqualLogic's widely-regarded channel program and extend the benefits of Dell's full server and storage product lines.

Here's a vlog where I talk more about this acquisition.
