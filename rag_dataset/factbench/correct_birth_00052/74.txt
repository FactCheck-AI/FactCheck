Born in Baltimore, Maryland, on December 21, 1940, Frank Zappa was largely a self-taught musician, whose 30-year career embraced a wide variety of musical genres, encompassing rock, jazz, synth, and symphonies. Avant-garde composers, as well as math and chemistry from his father's work, all fell into Zappa's mix of influences and comprised his unique approach to his art, coupled with a flouting of convention. Zappa also directed films, designed album covers, and spoke about social issues. Although his bizarre and rebellious streak occasionally overshadowed his compositional strength, Zappa is highly respected as a guitarist and musical pioneer. He died from prostate cancer on December 4, 1993, at age 52.
