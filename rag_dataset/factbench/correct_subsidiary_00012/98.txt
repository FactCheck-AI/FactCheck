ABOUT CONRAIL

The areas we serve are shared assets of CSX and Norfolk Southern. Customers located along Conrail's lines have access to the national rail network through either railway.

As a local rail service provider, it's our job to make sure that customers' freight shipments are safely and efficiently moved between their rail sidings and the long distance freight trains operated by CSX and Norfolk Southern.

CSX and Norfolk Southern handle all commercial matters for customers. However, we play a critical role in serving shippers and receivers as a service provider for our owners.
