(showbizspy.com) -Actor Ryan Phillippe has gone public with his Abbie Cornish romance two years after the Aussie actress was accused of coming between the actor and his then-wife Reese Witherspoon.

The Stop Loss film lovers were spotted holding hands at the 2008 Australian in Film Breakthrough Awards on Thursday (05Jun08).

One guest tells People.com, "They were adorable. He had his arm around her and they were cozy and comfortable."

Cornish was honoured with a Breakthrough Award at the event.

Reports the new couple fell in love on the set of Stop Loss, when Phillippe was still married to Witherspoon, have been routinely squashed by Phillippe and Cornish.
