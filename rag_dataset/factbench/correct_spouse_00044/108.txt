Elizabeth Hurley married an Indian businessman in a private civil ceremony at a 15th-century castle in Winchcombe, England.

Gloucestershire County Council confirmed that Hurley, 41, and Arun Nayar, 42, married Friday at Sudeley Castle in Winchcombe, 125 miles west of London. The pair held a blessing and party at the castle Saturday evening, with guests including Elton John, Kate Moss, Elle Macpherson and Hurley's ex, Hugh Grant.

Hurley and Nayar are expected to fly to India for celebrations in Mumbai and Rajasthan next week.
