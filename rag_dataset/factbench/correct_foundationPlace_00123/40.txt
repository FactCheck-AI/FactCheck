LimeWire, the decentralized peer-to-peer file trading service, was ordered by a federal to shut down on Tuesday.

The company, Lime Wire LLC, had been in a legal battle with the major labels including Arista, BMG, Sony, and Warner Bros.

LimeWire’s demise represents a victory for the music industry’s ongoing battle against internet piracy.

The presiding judge ordered LimeWire to shut down all versions of the software as of Wednesday.

The exact terms of the shut down include”the searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality, and/or all functionality.”

If the company were to resurface, it would have to implement a copyright filter.
