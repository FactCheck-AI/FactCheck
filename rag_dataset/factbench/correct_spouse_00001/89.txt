Owen Wilson is getting ready to have a real-life little Focker of his own.

E! News has learned that the big-screen goofball is set to become a first-time dad with under-the-radar girlfriend, Jade Duell.

"Owen Wilson and Jade Duell are happy to be expecting a baby," says the rep for the 42-year-old Wilson.

While they have kept their relationship on the down-low, Duell has been by Wilson's side almost nonstop and was living with him while he shot a movie in Vancouver last year, according to an insider.

The Wedding Crashers star has been living with Duell at his home in Maui, and he is said to be stoked about impending parenthood. Although the source says the couple is "very happy," they have no plans for a marriage at this point.

Congrats!
