Avril Lavigne and her rock musician husband Deryck Whibley have split up, she has announced on her website.

The singer, 24, wrote on her blog that she and Whibley, 29, lead singer of Sum 41, were "separating and moving forward on a positive note".

"I am grateful for our time together and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship," she added.

The couple, who both grew up in Ontario, Canada, started dating in early 2004 and married in July 2006.

The singer, whose hits include Sk8er Boi and Complicated, wrote on her website: "We have been friends since I was 17, started dating when I was 19, and married when I was 21."

"I admire Deryck and have a great amount of respect for him.

"He is the most amazing person I know and I love him with all my heart."

Songs from the singer's as-yet-untitled fourth album, due out in November, have been produced by her husband.

Sum 41's last album, 2007's Underclass Hero, reached number seven in the US.
