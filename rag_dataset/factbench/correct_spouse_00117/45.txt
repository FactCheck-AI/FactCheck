Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley took Avril Lavigne’s name when they were married, something that went under the radar during their four years of marriage. Now three years after their divorce was finalized, the singer has finally filed a petition to have his ex-wife’s last name dropped, Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley Finalize Divorce

According to the report, Deryck James Lavigne Whibley filed legal documents in L.A. County Court late last week to go back to his birth name, Deryck James Whibley.

Whibley and Lavigne married in 2006, with Lavigne filing for divorce in 2009. Their divorce was finalized in late 2010.

This past summer, Lavigne married Nickelback singer Chad Kroeger.
