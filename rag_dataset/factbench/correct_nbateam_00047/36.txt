The New Jersey Nets have reportedly come to agreement with the Portland Trail Blazers on a deal that will bring Gerald Wallace to the Prudential Center.

Adrian Wojnarowski reports that the teams have finalized terms to send Gerald Wallace to New Jersey in exchange for Mehmet Okur, Shawne Williams and a first-round pick in the 2012 NBA Draft.

The draft pick is reportedly protected only if it is a top 3 selection, meaning the Nets could possibly have to surrender a top-5 pick in what is considered one of the deepest drafts in years.

Rather than deal Deron Williams, the Nets are apparently trying to convince him to stay by making the team more competitive. It's unclear what affect this deal will have on Williams' impending free agency since Gerald Wallace does not instantly make the Nets contender, but it is a sign that the Nets are committed to winning now.
