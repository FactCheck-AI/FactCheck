CHARLOTTE BOBCATS ROOKIE EMEKA OKAFOR TO APPEAR ON THE WB'S "ONE TREE HILL" ON TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 9

NBA ROOKIE GIVES LUCAS AND NATHAN THE LOWDOWN ON PLAYING IN THE NBA

You've seen him on "SportsCenter" and leading the University of Connecticut to an NCAA men's basketball championship, now you can see Charlotte Bobcats rookie Emeka Okafor on The WB's hit series ONE TREE HILL on Tuesday, November 9 (9:00-10:00 p.m. ET).

Okafor, a two-time All-American and one of the most prolific shot blockers in college basketball history, plays himself on the episode entitled "Truth, Bitter Truth." The show's two central characters half-brothers Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan (James Lafferty) Scott go to a Charlotte Bobcats game (filmed during the preseason, during the first victory in Bobcats franchise history). Lucas and Nathan, the two best basketball players in Tree Hill, North Carolina, meet Okafor, the second overall selection in the 2004 NBA draft, who gives them advice on playing in the league.

ONE TREE HILL is having a sensational season. It is television's fastest-growing returning show and regularly ranks #1 in its time slot in The WB's core demographics of young women. The series also stars Hilarie Burton, Bethany Joy Lenz, Paul Johansson, Sophia Bush, Barbara Alyn Woods, Barry Corbin, Craig Sheffer and Moira Kelly.

ONE TREE HILL is from executive producer and show creator Mark Schwahn, executive producers Mike Tollin, Brian Robbins, Joe Davola and Mark Perry for Tollin/Robbins Productions and Warner Bros. Television Production Inc.
