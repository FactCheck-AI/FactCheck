No sooner had Charlotte Bobcats centre Emeka Okafor signed on the dotted line than he pronounced himself excited to play for incoming head coach Larry Brown.

"It is exciting to enter this season with a Hall of Fame coach and teammates who are committed to winning," Okafor said as he inked his six-year, $72-million US contract on Thursday.

It is the most lucrative deal in Bobcats history, but Okafor has earned it with career averages of 14.3 points, 10.8 rebounds, 2.0 blocks and 34.4 minutes in 248 games, including 245 starts.

Moreover, he has been the face of the expansion franchise since Charlotte drafted him second overall in 2004.

"It was important for us to get a deal done," Bobcats general manager Rod Higgins said.

Okafor is just one of four players to average a double-double in each of the past four seasons, joining Tim Duncan of the San Antonio Spurs, Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic and Victoria's Steve Nash, a two-time NBA MVP with the Phoenix Suns.

"Securing Emeka demonstrates that Bob Johnson and the rest of our ownership group are committed to building a winning franchise in Charlotte," Higgins said. "Any time you have a player who consistently ranks among the NBA's best in rebounding and shot blocking, you want to keep a guy like that around."

Okafor started all 82 games last season, averaging 13.8 points, 10.7 rebounds, 1.7 blocks and 33.2 minutes.
