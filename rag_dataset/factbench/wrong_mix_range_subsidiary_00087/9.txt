Verifone announced a new agreement to acquire AJB Software Design, a Toronto-based provider of payment gateway and switching solutions for large merchants, in order to offer an end-to-end payments solution.

By doing so, Verifone has expanded its service offerings for retailers in the U.S. and Canada. The solution that Verifone will acquire from AJB is one that roughly 150 large retailers in the U.S. and Canada rely on as a gateway to connect nearly half a million payment devices.

AJB connects devices from Verifone and other providers to more than 100 processors and applications — including government benefits, stored-value cards and fleet cards — that are required by supermarkets, c-stores and other merchants. By acquiring AJB, Verifone can enable its partners (such as ISVs and acquirers) to deliver payment and commerce services to keep up with merchants’ demands for more simplicity, security, flexibility and functionality.
