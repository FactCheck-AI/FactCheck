Britney Spears and Kevin Federline have certainly had their ups and downs since splitting in November 2006. The former couple — who tied the knot in 2004 and share sons Sean Preston and Jayden — have gone from feuding exes to supportive coparents.

Federline praised his ex-wife for seeking mental health treatment amid her father Jamie Spears’ illness in April 2019.

“Kevin commends Britney for recognizing that she needs to take a step back and that she is taking the reasonable steps to deal with her situation in a responsible way,” Federline’s attorney, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told The Blast. He also agreed to care for their children until she recovered.

Following their divorce in 2007, the twosome have continued to coparent — but it hasn’t always been easy. In her 2023 memoir, The Woman in Me, Spears revealed she shaved her head due to a disagreement over their kids. While the pair have faced their fair share of custody battles, a source exclusively told Us Weekly in September 2019 that the former couple had agreed to a new custody agreement. Federline would have custody of their boys 70 percent of the time, while the “Toxic” singer would get 30 percent unsupervised custodial rights.

However, Spears' relationships with Federline and her sons seemingly hit a rough patch after they skipped out on her wedding to now-estranged husband Sam Asghari in June 2022. The following years, they revealed they were moving to Hawaii with their father.

“Britney has never given up hope on repairing things with her kids,” a source exclusively told Us in July 2023. “But she hasn’t seen them in a long time, and she isn’t exactly sure when she’ll see them again now that they’re moving to Hawaii.”
