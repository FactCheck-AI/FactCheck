Here are the essential 50 Sci Fi authors and their 116 key works, as proposed by John C. Wright. This page tracks my progress getting copies and reading them.

Update: adding links to free editions on the Web where available; adding 1st published date. When I get all the first published dates in, I’ll reformat the list chronologically – that way, it’s easier to see who was cribbing from whom.

As of October 23th, 2015, I’ve read 46 (40%) of the stories and novels, and have copies to read of another 23 (20%).
