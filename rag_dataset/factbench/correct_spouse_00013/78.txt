Screenwriter Simon Monjack, the husband of the late actress Brittany Murphy, was found dead in his home on Sunday night. The cause of death is still unknown.

According to The Los Angeles Times, the Fire Department responded to a 911 call to Monjack's home. They arrived, "provided medical services," and pronounced him dead at the scene.

Who's Simon Monjack, you ask? Here's one answer. In a nutshell: He was the screenwriter behind the Edie Sedgwick biography Factory Girl, and, most famously, married to the late Brittany Murphy, the actress from Clueless and 8 Mile.

Monjack was the subject of a lot of rumors and speculation after Muphy's death, none of which really panned out. He was a pretty weird guy, who only got weirder in the midst of all the publicity. He and Murphy's mother started a scam charity in Murphy's name, and then returned the money when they were called out. Recently, he had been complaining that Murphy didn't leave him any money her will.
