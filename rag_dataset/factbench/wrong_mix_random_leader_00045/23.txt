A bust to Frederic Mistral (1830-1914) of the Provencal poet stands on a high pedestal, in front of the stairs leading to the National Palace. The authors of the monument are Catalans: architect Josep Puig-i-Kadafalk (author Colonnas Puig-i-Kadafalk) and sculptor Eusebi Arnau i Maskort. The monument was unveiled on June 29, 1930 in honor of the centenary of the birth of Mistral. By that time, the architect Puig-i-Kadafalk was removed from the post of chairman of the Catalan parliament in connection with the 1923 coup. After which the Spanish constitution was suspended, censorship was introduced, a “military directory” was created, headed by Primo de Rivera. The opening of the monument to the protesting poet, a kind of protest by the architect against the dictatorial regime, became possible after the resignation of Rivera in January 1930. But, with the advent of the new dictator Franco, in 1939 the monument was dismantled and reopened on the occasion of the centenary of the death of the poet, March 25, 2014. Mistral was born and lived in Provence in France. Today in this province there is not a single city, not a single village, wherever there is no Mistral street. What is his merit to fellow countrymen? Mistral revived Provencal language all his life. He popularized this language in his poems and founded the Felibre society, which celebrates the culture of the French South. Mistral received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1904. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that the language in which the poet wrote is not a state language. T. about. the prize does not support the mainstream of French literature, but fuels and glorifies the direction opposed to state doctrine. It is not surprising that with the advent of Franco, who supported the Nazis Hitler and Mussolini, the monument was dismantled, the dictatorship does not allow identity. Today, the monument to Nobel laureate Frederick Mistral has returned to its place on Mount Montjuic.
