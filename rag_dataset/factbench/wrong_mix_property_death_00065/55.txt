Appelstraße 7

Between 1885 and 1888, the building Königlicher Pferdestall was built for the 1st uhlan regiment No. 13 in Hannover. Following its military use, the two-storey redbrick building became the property of the former polytechnic college in Hannover, today’s Leibniz University Hannover. During this period, it was used as an institute building, as well as for conducting experiments and courses. Today, the building has been converted into a forum for communication, science and culture.
