Anna and Ben married in 2004 but three years later realised neither of them “were happy in the relationship”.

It was during the filming of Take Me Home Tonight, in which Anna starred alongside Chris Pratt and Topher Grace, that she realised she needed to end her marriage.

The final nail in the coffin came after Ben joined Anna and her fellow cast mates on a night out.

While Anna went home early, Ben continued to party and ended up crawling into bed at 7am.

“I don’t know what exactly went down, but the next evening I was talking with (Topher), who played my brother in the film,” Anna writes.

Topher then asked Anna, “what the f**k are you doing with that guy?”

Anna also went on to reveal her insecurities which only began to grow as her profile blossomed.

“Around the time I was filming The House Bunny, I started getting lip injections in my upper lip. I did it for a little bit and I noticed a small difference, but no one else ever said anything. I kept wondering if anybody else even noticed”, she said.

The actress said it was only when he friends old her that her lips were beginning to look “too big” that she stared to ween off them.
