Description

William George 1820-1864 and Elizabeth George (nee Lloyd) 1828-1896. William George, David Lloyd George's father, was a Pembrokeshire man from Trefwrdan. When teaching at Pwllheli he met and married Elizabeth Lloyd of Llanystumdwy. They later moved to Manchester where David Lloyd George was born in January 1863. Before the end of the year they returned to Pembrokeshire where William began to keep a smallholding. A sick man physically and subject to bouts of depression, he died of pneumonia in June 1864. Elizabeth and the children, Ellen and David, moved to Llanystumdwy to live with her brother Richard. Within a few months another child was born who was named William after his late father.
