Actress Lisa Faulkner has said she is “happy” she is infertile as she would not have her adopted daughter otherwise.

The former EastEnders star, 47, has a 13-year-old daughter Billie, who she adopted with her ex-husband Chris Coghill.

She told The Times magazine: “I am really happy that I am infertile because I wouldn’t have got Billie without it. I think I love her more because she is not my birth child. It is ferocious and it comes from here (my heart).”

“But I don’t think that yearning to be pregnant will ever completely go until I hit the menopause and I can’t physically have children any more.”

Faulkner is engaged to MasterChef judge and chef John Torode.

The pair met when she was a contestant on – and won – Celebrity MasterChef in 2010.

She said: “We have a really lovely time. He looks after me and I look after him. It’s nice to have a second chance, because sometimes (after a divorce) you think, ‘Maybe that’s it.’ I do see this as a second chance.”

Torode and Faulkner, who has written a memoir called Meant To Be, present John And Lisa’s Weekend Kitchen on ITV.
