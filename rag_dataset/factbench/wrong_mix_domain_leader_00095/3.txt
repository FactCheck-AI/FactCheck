John Kerry drew from this experience to provide the State Department with global stewardship on issues ranging from nuclear nonproliferation to radical extremists, to humanitarian challenges and the rising threat of climate change. In 2013, Kerry became the first Secretary of State to meet with Iranâs Foreign Minister since the Iranian revolution of 1979. He negotiated a path to renewed talks and cooperation between the two countries. This meeting was the highest-level U.S. diplomatic contact with Iran in more than six years, and a key moment on the journey towards the eventual signing of the landmark 2015 agreement to prevent Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon. Kerry was able to maneuver the complexities of such difficult negotiations by leveraging his experience, expertise, and insights from decades of service and diplomacy.

Faced with the rising threat of global climate change, Kerry was also a key architect of the Paris Climate Accord, negotiating on a global platform to finally sign the historic agreement to reduce carbon emissions in 2016. Kerry drew upon a lifetime of public service during his tenure as Secretary.

A best-selling author of A Call to Service: My Vision for a Better America and This Moment on Earth, Secretary Kerry released his first memoir, Every Day Is Extra, in 2018.

Dr. Santiago Calatrava is one of the worldâs most influential architects. Currently working on building the worldâs tallest tower in Dubai, the Swiss-Spanish architect is recognized for his iconic, sculptural buildings such as the World Trade Center station in New York, the Olympic Sports Complex in Athens and the University of Zurich Law Schoolâs library.

Calatrava puts emphasis on the fact that he is not only an architect and an engineer, but also an artist. He is known for his futuristic structures and forms that are often inspired by living organisms. His design of Zurichâs Stadelhofen railway station was the starting point of his international career. Calatravaâs designs suggest stylized natural objectsâwaves, wings, or sun-bleached skeletons, with rows of white concrete ribs curved into distorted parabolic arches.

After his PhD in Engineering from ETH Zurich, Calatrava received numerous honorary doctors from international universities, including those of Tel Aviv, Mexico City, Lima, LiÃ¨ge, Madrid, Atlanta, and Columbia University. In 2004, Calatrava was awarded the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects.
