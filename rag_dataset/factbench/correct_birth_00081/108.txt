After a two-year relationship, Nas married Kelis in Atlanta, Georgia in 2005. Kelis is best known as the singer/songwriter behind the 2003 smash hit "Milkshake" which has been a cultural staple since its release. On July 21, 2009 Kelis gave birth to Nas' second child and only son, Knight Jones. Unlike his older sister, Knight doesn't seem to have much of a social media presence at this time, likely due to his age. Of course, the public may begin to see more of the former power-couples' kid in the coming years as he enters adulthood.

On the night his son was born, Nas spread the word, by making an announcement during a live show in Queens, New York. Per sources close to the couple, Kelis disagreed with the decision to make their son's birth public information. This disagreement served as just one of many public disputes between the couple.

The Pair Split Up In 2010

Nas and Kelis finalized their divorce in May of 2010, resulting in a years-long public feud between the performing artists. In the decade since their marriage ended, Nas and Kelis have hurled insults and accusations of abuse at one another. The pair have also engaged in prolonged fights regarding child support and alimony payments. These fights have caused fans to take to social media to choose sides.

Though the pair have gone their separate ways, the two seem to finally be co-parenting respectfully in 2023 and beyond. Kelis has gone on to have two more children with her second husband, who died of stomach cancer In 2022. Meanwhile, Nas has reportedly engaged in brief love affairs with notable figures such as Mary J. Blige and Nicki Minaj.
