Former Dutch prime minister Ruud Lubbers resigned as head of the U.N. refugee organization this week, because of allegations that he sexually harassed an employee. In his resignation letter, Lubbers denied the charge and said he was being forced out for political reasons. A U.N. investigative report found Lubbers responsible for “a pattern of misconduct” toward women in his office. Five women accused him of groping or fondling them, although only one of those cases had supporting evidence. Lubbers, who headed the High Commission for Refugees for four years, said he was just being friendly. “I call it familiar,” he said, “but certainly not sexual harassment.”
