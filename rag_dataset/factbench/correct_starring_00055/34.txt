The comic actor Norman Rossington, whose credits include Carry On films and the cinema classic Lawrence of Arabia, has died.

The 70-year-old died actor in a Manchester hospital after a six-month battle with cancer.

Until a fall on stage last November, Rossington had been appearing in the London West End stage hit Beauty And The Beast.

Born in Liverpool, the he appeared in more than 40 films, including the A Hard Day's Night with the Beatles, the World War II epic The Longest Day and A Night to Remember about the Titanic disaster.

In fact Rossington 'went down with the ship' in three separate productions about the tragedy.

He was also in the very first Carry On movie, Carry On Sergeant and the classic Saturday Night And Sunday Morning with Albert Finney.

Rossington trained at the Bristol Old Vic and began his career at the city's Theatre Royal.

His stage career included time spent with the Royal Shakespeare Company and at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.

Among his many TV appearances were parts in I Claudius and, more recently, Last Of The Summer Wine, Heartbeat and Sharpe's Regiment.

Rossington is survived by his wife, Cindy, whom he married two months ago.
