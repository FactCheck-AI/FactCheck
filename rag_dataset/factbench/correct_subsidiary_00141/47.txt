Software giant Oracle said Monday it will acquire Siebel Systems Inc., a customer-relationship management software company. The deal is estimated to be worth $5.85 billion US.

"In a single step, Oracle becomes the No. 1 CRM applications company in the world," Oracle CEO Larry Ellison said in a statement. "Siebel's 4,000 applications customers and 3.4 million CRM users strengthen our No. 1 position in applications in North America and move us closer to the No. 1 position in applications globally."

Customer relationship management software assists organizations by integrating and automating basic business processes.

A spokesperson for Oracle said the deal values Siebel at $10.66 US per share. Shares of Siebel rose $1.22 to $10.35 US in premarket trading following the news, while Oracle shares fell 28 cents to $13 US.

Siebel's board and chairman approved the deal. The purchase is expected to close in early 2006, subject to regulatory and Siebel shareholder approval.
