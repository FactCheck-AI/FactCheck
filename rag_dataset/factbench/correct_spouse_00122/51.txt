Lopez, 41, and Anthony, 42, were married in June 2004 and are the parents of three-year-old twins, Max and Emme.

The “American Idol” judge had been married twice before she wed Anthony, a top-selling salsa singer and minority owner of the Miami Dolphins NFL team.

In 1997, she married former waiter Ojani Noa, but the couple split a year later.

Her second marriage, to back-up dancer Cris Judd, lasted from 2001 to 2003.

Anthony was previously married to former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres from May 2000 to January 2004. He had two sons with the Puerto Rican model.
