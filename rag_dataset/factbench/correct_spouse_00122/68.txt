Marc Anthony has officially filed for divorce from his singer and actress wife Jennifer Lopez.

Anthony, 43, filed the petition under his real name Marco Muniz on Monday in the Los Angeles Superior Court, citing irreconcilable differences.

The couple announced that they were splitting up in July after seven years of marriage.

Marc Anthony also filed for joint legal and physical custody of the couple's four-year-old twins, Max and Emme.

American Idol judge Lopez, 42, and Marc Anthony married in June 2004, months after Lopez's engagement to actor Ben Affleck ended and days after Anthony's divorce from former Miss Puerto Rico Dayanara Torres was finalised.

The couple's split has been friendly so far.

J.Lo and Marc Anthony, who is a Latin singer, are working together on new television talent show Q'Viva! The Chosen.

Jennifer Lopez is now dating 25-year-old dancer Casper Smart.

She released her seventh studio album Love? last year.
