Very few NBA players have hands as steady as Deron Williams does. He’s been among the best when it comes to bucket-assistance while being a scoring point guard as well, and he’s definitely picking up the scoring slack this season based on his career high 22.1 points per game. The Utah Jazz Home court is considered to be one of the toughest places to play as a visitor, due to the raucous crowd and fan loyalty, but for when Deron’s away, he’ll be wearing this colorway of the Nike Zoom Hyperfuse PE; it features a black base with hints of green and blue with D-Will’s ‘D8W’ logo on the upper collar. If only Deron’s future as a member of the Jazz was as steady as his hands were; he’s been openly unhappy about Utah’s front office moves (or lack of) and signed a short three-year contract, pointing to a possible departure during the summer of 2012. In the meantime, you can cop the Nike Zoom Hyperfuse Away PE at House of Hoops right now, so check out the extra detailed shots after the jump.
