In 1973, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz, and Niko Tinbergen for their groundbreaking discoveries concerning the organization and elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns1. Their pioneering work not only revolutionized the field of behavioral biology but also laid the foundation for understanding how animals, including humans, interact with their environments and each other. Among the foundational contributions, Konrad Lorenz's "Kumpan paper" published in 1935 stands out as a seminal piece that illuminated the intricate connections between animals and their social companions2,3.

To commemorate the 50th anniversary of this momentous achievement, we invite researchers across disciplines to contribute to a special topical collection that explores the legacy, impact, and ongoing advancements in the study of individual and social behavior patterns in animals. This collection will highlight the significance of the Nobel laureates' work and delve into contemporary research that has built upon their foundational findings.

Topics of Interest:

We welcome original research articles, reviews, and perspectives that encompass a wide range of topics related to behavioral biology, including but not limited to:

• Evolutionary insights into behavior patterns

• Social interactions and communication mechanisms

• Role of environment in shaping behavior

• Neurobiological mechanisms underlying behavior

• Comparative studies across species

• Ethical considerations in animal behavior research

Submission Guidelines:

Researchers are invited to submit their manuscripts through the journal's online submission system. Manuscripts should follow the journal's standard formatting and referencing guidelines. All submitted papers will undergo standard peer review to ensure the quality and relevance of the contributions. For inquiries and submissions, please contact the Editor-in-Chief Franz Bairlein.

Join us in celebrating the rich legacy of Karl von Frisch, Konrad Lorenz, and Niko Tinbergen while exploring the exciting frontiers of behavioral biology. We look forward to receiving your insightful contributions.
