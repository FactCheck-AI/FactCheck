&#151; -- The cast of the all-female "Ghostbusters" movie has received the seal of approval from Dan Aykroyd, who co-wrote and starred in the first two movies in the series.

It was announced Tuesday that Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and "Saturday Night Live" stars Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones will take part in the new installment in the franchise.

"The Aykroyd family is delighted by this inheritance of the 'Ghostbusters' torch by these most magnificent women in comedy," Akroyd said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. "My great grandfather, Dr. Sam Aykroyd, the original Ghostbuster, was a man who empowered women in his day, and this is a beautiful development in the legacy of our family business."

Aykroyd, 62, co-wrote "Ghostbusters" and "Ghostbusters II" with the late Harold Ramis, with whom he co-starred in the films along with Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson. After Ramis' death last year, Ivan Reitman, who had directed the first two installments and had been tapped to helm the third, bowed out of the project. Paul Feig is will now direct.

After word of the new "Ghostbusters" cast got out, Hudson tweeted, "Two words: 'No comment.'"

The all-female "Ghostbusters" movie will open July 22, 2016.
