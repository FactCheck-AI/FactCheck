Phoenix Suns fans: Here's a quick-and-dirty introduction to the team's newest member, Jason Richardson, who was acquired in Wednesday's five-player trade that sent Raja Bell and Boris Diaw to the Charlotte Bobcats.

* While at Michigan State, the McDonald's All-American -- along with legendary college ballers Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and Charlie Bell -- led the Spartans to the 2000 NCAA Championship.

* Other than Michael Jordan, the dynamic 6-foot-6 shooting guard is the only high-flying cat to win consecutive Slam Dunk Contests, which Richardson did in 2002 and 2003.

* During the 2006-07 NBA Playoffs, Richardson's 19 points per game helped the Golden State Warriors - who hadn't been in the postseason in 13 years - to an astounding first-round series victory against the Dallas Mavericks, a 67-win team that was the NBA's best in the regular season.

* Last season, Richardson showed his durability by starting in all 82 games for the Charlotte Bobcats, pouring in 21.8 points per game and connecting on a career-best 40.6 percent from behind the 3-point arc.
