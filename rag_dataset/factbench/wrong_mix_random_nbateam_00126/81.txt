Philip Jose Farmer, 91, one of the most celebrated science fiction, fantasy and short-story writers of the 1960s and '70s, died Wednesday in his sleep, according to a message posted on his official Web site.

The Peoria resident wrote more than 75 novels, including the Riverworld and World of Tiers series. He won the Hugo Award three times and the Grand Master Award for Science Fiction in 2001.

Mr. Farmer's first published story, The Lovers, caught the attention of the science fiction world in 1952 with one of the genre's first serious treatments of sexuality. At the time, he was working full time at a Peoria steel mill and writing on the side.

The Lovers was based on a love affair between a man on Earth and an alien woman, and Mr. Farmer rocked the science fiction community by dealing with sex in a frank manner. The story inspired some of the greatest science fiction writers, including Robert Heinlein, whose classic Stranger in a Strange Land was dedicated to Mr. Farmer.
