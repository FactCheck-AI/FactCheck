EMC Corporation has entered the world of software-as-a-service (SaaS) with its new MozyEnterprise backup application..

The system enables online backup of desktops, laptops and remote Windows servers.

MozyEnterprise is based on the Mozy family of online backup products that became part of EMC with the acquisition of Berkeley Data Systems in October last year.

The offering is built on the EMC Fortress platform, which is designed to be a secure enterprise-class SaaS delivery system.

"Our strategy is focused on bringing new SaaS offerings to market, powered by EMC," said Tom Heiser, senior vice president and general manager of EMC's SaaS business unit.

"EMC Fortress is a secure, multi-tenant, scalable platform providing customers with centralised billing, management and metering."

MozyEnterprise is designed to help automate secure online backup and recovery, offering reliable off-site data protection for remote desktops, laptops and branch office servers.

The system offers new features including integrated key management, authentication and authorisation security and a range of automation and remote administration tools.

MozyEnterprise is available immediately in the US through EMC and its reseller partners and is scheduled to be rolled out to other countries later in 2008.
