TechCrunch reports that online storage startup Mozy has been acquired by EMC Corporation for $76 million. Mozy is among a bunch of online backup startups launched in late 2005. Personal accounts on Mozy are $4.95 a month, while business accounts start at $3.95 per computer plus 50 cents per gig. Mozy apparently raised just $1.9 million in venture capital, and is rumored to have turned down a takeover offer from Google some months back. Mozy's data is stored in a 24,000 square foot Salt Lake City, Utah data center operated by Berkeley Data Systems.
