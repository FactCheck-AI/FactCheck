Verizon Wireless, or more commonly referred to as Verizon or VZW, is an American telecommunications conglomerate founded in Delaware. Verizon covers a vast amount of consumer products, such as cable and digital television, broadband internet, cellular and landline telephone networks, and much more.

Verizon first started out as Bell Atlantic in 1984, selling landline phone networks throughout the east coast of the United States. In 1997, Bell Atlantic merged with NYNEX and bought out their cellular division to create Bell Atlantic Mobile which let them sell their phones throughout New York and New England. In 1999, Bell Atlantic merged with GTE and Vodafone Airtouch and renamed to Verizon a year later.

After the countless mergers and after changing their name, Verizon began merging with smaller landline and cellular networks and spread from the East Coast to the Midwest. In 2005, Verizon launched FiOS, their fiber optic cellular/landline/television network, which was offered in 7 states, all on the East Coast. In 2006 they launched V-Cast, a music, video, and Mobile TV service on most 3G EVDO phones (excluding inPulse prepaid phones) sold from 2006 to 2011. Verizon launched their 4G network on December 5, 2010, with handsets being released in the following weeks and months. Verizon launched the first 5G network in the United States in Houston, Texas on October 1, 2018.
