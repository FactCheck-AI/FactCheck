About Bell Atlantic

Bell Atlantic Corp. merged with GTE Corp. to become Verizon Communications Inc. on June 30, 2000.

Prior to the merger, Bell Atlantic operated as a premier provider of advanced wireline voice and data services, a market leader in wireless services and the world’s largest publisher of directory information, with operations in and investments in 23 countries. It provided local telephone service to customers in 13 states from Maine to Virginia, as well as Washington, DC.

Bell Atlantic was founded in 1984 as one of the seven Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs) in the wake of the breakup of the Bell System. Bell Atlantic merged with NYNEX, a fellow RBOC, in 1997 and subsequently moved its headquarters from Philadelphia to New York City.

The Bell Atlantic-GTE transaction – valued at more than $52 billion at the time of the announcement in July 1998 – combined Bell Atlantic’s sophisticated network with GTE’s national footprint to create new a leader in the communications industry. After receiving regulatory approval for the merger, Verizon began operations in mid-2000.
