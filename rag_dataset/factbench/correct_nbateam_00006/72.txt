You’re not going to believe this, but Dwight Howard has once again put his foot in his mouth. Shocking, we know … In a wide-ranging interview with a CBS TV affiliate, Howard threw his former teammates under the bus by saying they were players that “nobody wanted”, but that he still deigned to lead them. Howard and the Los Angeles Lakers will visit the Orlando Magic next week, which should be a fun little circus. Per the Orlando Sentinel: “Howard began: ‘And I understand coming here to L.A., Kobe’s here and for 17 years Laker fans have seen Kobe be, they just see Kobe as somebody who’s serious. It seems like he doesn’t fool around, joke around, whatever it may be. But that’s his personality, and just because I don’t necessary make a [growling sound] or do all that during games or on the bench, that doesn’t mean I don’t care about succeeding or wanting to win. And I always tell people, ‘Hey, my team in Orlando was a team full of people who nobody wanted, and I was the leader and I led that team with a smile on my face.’ Howard’s comment will add some intrigue to the March 12 matchup between Howard’s Lakers and the Magic at Amway Center. That game will be Howard’s first game in Orlando since April 5, 2012. […] That sentiment, as well as his previously stated desire to play alongside point guards Chris Paul and Deron Williams, created friction with his teammates, including his Magic co-captain, Jameer Nelson.”
