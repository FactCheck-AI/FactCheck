Young Hollywood couple (and "Brokeback Mountain" co-stars) Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams have welcomed their first bundle of joy: a baby daughter named Matilda, according to reports. The pair began dating on the set of "Mountain" while working as on-screen husband and wife in the Ang Lee-directed cowboy romance due out next month. While mommy Williams enjoys some post-natal bonding time with the little one, Ledger will be busy premiering his period rom-com "Casanova" (November 30) one week before the highly anticipated "Mountain" debuts December 9.
