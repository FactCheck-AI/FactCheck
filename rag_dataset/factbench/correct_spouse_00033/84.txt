Heath Ledger’s dad has spoken out about Michelle Williams “secret” wedding, saying it’s “great” she has tied the knot.

The late Aussie actor’s dad Kim said he and his family were delighted Michelle — who dated Heath before he died and had a daughter, Matilda, with him — had married musician Phil Elverum in a secret ceremony in New York last week.

“We are terribly happy, it is great,” he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

The grandad of 12-year-old Matilda admitted he is yet to meet Michelle’s new man but has plans to do so “soon”.

“She’s very private and I don’t really like to make too many comments about her, but we are very happy for her,” he said.

Michelle revealed she had married in an interview with Vanity Fair last week, saying she “never gave up on love” after losing Heath.

Detailing their nuptials, the 37-year-old said they enjoyed a private ceremony in the Adirondack Mountains earlier this month.

Only a handful of their friends – presumably including BFF Busy Philipps – and their two daughters attended the ceremony.

Her wedding comes ten years after Heath passed away in 2008 following a cardiac arrest brought on by a drugs overdose. He was 28.

They started dating in 2004 after they met on the set of Brokeback Mountain and welcomed their daughter a year later.

Sadly the pair split in 2007 after Michelle reportedly found out that he had been abusing drugs.

Kim has always maintained a good relationship with the Dawson’s Creek alum.
