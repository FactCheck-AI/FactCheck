GAINESVILLE, Fla. (WCJB) - June. 2. marks 16 years since a rock-and-roll pioneer died in North Central Florida.

Bo Diddley was 79 years old when he died inside his archer home in 2008.

Songs like ‘Pretty Thing’, ‘I’m a Man’ and ‘Who Do You Love’ gave him several chart-toppers throughout the 50′s and 60′s.

But he also inspired rock and roll legends like ‘Buddy Holly’ and ‘U2.’

And of course, there’s a music venue named after him in downtown Gainesville.
