Los Angeles Clippers shooting guard Jamal Crawford has won Sixth Man of the Year for a record third time, the NBA announced Tuesday morning.

Crawford took home the prize with 51 first-place votes out of 130 voters. Golden State Warriors swingman Andre Iguodala came in second with 33 first-place votes, while Oklahoma City Thunder big man Enes Kanter earned 19 first-place tallies and finished third in the voting. The Denver Nuggets' Will Barton and Boston Celtics' Evan Turner round out the top five.

Crawford had been just one of four players who'd won the award twice, with the others being Kevin McHale, Ricky Pierce and Detlef Schrempf. Now the 36-year-old has become the first three-time winner after winning it two out of the last three years with Los Angeles.

Crawford averaged just over 14 points on 40 percent shooting overall and 34 percent from three in nearly 27 minutes per game this season. Those numbers jumped up to nearly 16 points per game on 42 percent shooting overall and 34 percent from three when Blake Griffin missed over three months with his hand and quad injuries.

Crawford also led the Clippers in fourth-quarter scoring, pouring in 341 points in the final frame.

Here are the final voting results:
