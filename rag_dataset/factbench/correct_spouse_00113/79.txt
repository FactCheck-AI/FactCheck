Kelly McGillis and Melanie Leis were joined in a civil-union ceremony in New Jersey Wednesday morning.

McGillis, 53, confirmed rumors that she was a lesbian in an interview last year.

The couple met in 2000, when Leis bartended in Key West, FL, at a restaurant owned by McGillis and her second husband, Fred Tillman.

McGillis, a Julliard graduate, is best known for her starring roles in “Top Gun” and “Witness.” Her latest film, “Stake Land,” will be shown at the Toronto Film Festival this week.

Leis, 42, is a graduate of the Berklee College of Music. She is currently a regional sales executive in Philadelphia with Independence Communications, a Muzak provider.
