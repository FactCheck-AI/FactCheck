Kelly McGillis, who stole fans’ hearts as Tom Cruise’s love interest in Top Gun and Harrison Ford’s in Witness, then came out as a lesbian last year, wed her partner, Melanie Leis. They were married in Collingswood, N.J., Municipal Court.

It was a civil union ceremony, as their home state of New Jersey does not recognize gay marriage. But the sentiment is the same, and we congratulate them.

Twice-divorced and with two children, Kelly McGillis announced she was a lesbian just last year although it had been long rumored in show business circles.

She and Melanie Leis first met when she worked as a bartender at a Key West, Fla., restaurant the actress owned with her then-husband, Fred Tillman.

McGillis has concentrated on stage work in recent years, though she did appear on the Showtime series about lesbians, The L Word. Congrats again!
