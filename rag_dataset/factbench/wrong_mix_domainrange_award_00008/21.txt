Par Fabian Lagerkvist was a poet, novelist, dramatist who was a dominant literary figure of Sweden during the first half of Twentieth Century. His father was a station master and the family was a god-fearing, religious family. Religious books such as Bible and other religious books formed the core of book collection. Though Lagerkvist broke away from traditional Christian beliefs, he was not overtly critical or rebellious of religious doctrines.

His poem Anguish(1916) is a cry of disillusionment against death, war and cruelty of life. The tone gradually turned to optimism and faith in the capability of man in his later works.

Barabbas(1953), when published, was immediately acknowledged as a masterpiece and is by far the best work of Lagerkvist. The novel was filmed in 1962.
