FARMINGTON, MEÂ (October 15, 2018)âA giant in the world of jazz, American jazz saxophonist John Coltrane and his work are the next featured selections of the New Commons Project of the University of Maine at Farmington. Events are free and open to the public.

An iconic figure of 20th century jazz, John William Coltrane (1926-1967), also known as âTrane,â is best known for his brilliant improvisation. Born in North Carolina, he played in a community band in his early years, picking up the alto saxophone in high school and performed in the U.S. Navy band during his service in World War II.

During the late 40s and 50s, he played with legendary musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, Johnny Hodges, the Miles Davis Quintet and Thelonious Monk. Coltrane formed his own acclaimed quartet in 1960. His first record with his new group featured his hugely successful âMy Favorite Things.â âGiant Steps,â âChasinâ the Trane,â and âA Love Supremeâ are among his celebrated recordings.

His memorable composition, âAlabama,â was written in response to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing on September 15, 1963. It is a powerful instrumental of the tragic Birmingham, Alabama, attack by the Ku Klux Klan that killed four African-American girls.

At the forefront of free jazz, Coltrane was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize in 2007 for his âmasterful improvisation, supreme musicianship and iconic centrality to the history of jazz.â

Twelve will be shared this year through a number of unique events, public discussions, talks and community engagement projects. These 12 works have been selected from more than 150 submissions by community members from a dozen Maine counties and include, a critically acclaimed TV show, public art installations by an anonymous artist, a jazz elegy and more.

The New Commons Project is a public humanities initiative of the University of Maine at Farmington, Maineâs public liberal arts college, in partnership with the Maine Humanities Council. It is made possible by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
