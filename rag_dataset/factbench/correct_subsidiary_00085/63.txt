"Yediot Ahronot" reported this morning that VeriFone, which acquired Lipman Electronics Engineering (Nasdaq: LPMA; TASE: LPMA) in April, was holding talks with Retalix (Nasdaq: RTLX; TASE: RTLX) for a possible acquisition. Retalix provides integrated enterprise-wide software solutions for the food and consumer retail and distribution industries worldwide.

"Yediot" said that both Retalix and VeriFone declined to comment on the report.

When it published its second quarter financials in August, Retalix lowered its guidance for 2006 as a whole, citing non-recurring expenses such as options expenses and an increase in project and research costs. A week and a half ago, the company announced that it wouldn't even meet its revised guidance and published a profit and revenue warning for the third and fourth quarters of 2006.
