McAdams, for both.

Seyfried has her moments (First Reformed) but she's often dull (Chloe, Gone), boring (Art of Racing in the Rain) or just bad (You Should Have Left, Million Ways to Die in the West). In the meatier roles, she seems to struggle as well, couldn't find anything special in her "Lovelace" performance. Her project choices are very inconsistent... I mean she was in "Red Riding Hood"..

In "Mean Girls", Amanda is funny but Rachel is iconic. Her comedic range is amazing in general, from "The Family Stone" to "Game Night", she manages to find the right beat, right timing to make her performances feel fresh and alive. Very effective dramatic performer also - impressive in "The Lucky Ones", recently deserved a nom for "Disobedience", I like her glamorous attitude in "Married Life". Her genre film choices - those included films by De Palma and Craven - are also much better and she's great in all of them, better than whatever Seyfried was trying to do in "Jennifer's Body". She can play ice-cold in films but she also has such uniquely warm presence in all those romantic films ("About Time") and even in weaker things like "Morning Glory", she still commands the screen. Oh and I take "The Notebook" any day over "Dear John".

So yeah, it's definitely McAdams. As for their looks, both are good but McAdams has more appeal.

Couldn't have said it better myself
