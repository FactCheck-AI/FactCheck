The Dropout star Amanda Seyfried has joined thriller series Long Bright River for streaming service Peacock.

According to Deadline, the series will be based on Liz Moore’s bestselling 2020 crime novel of the same name.

The plot follows police officer Mickey (Seyfried) who patrols a Philadelphia neighbourhood that has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. However, when a series of local murders begins, Mickey discovers that her personal history might tie into the case.

The Mamma Mia and Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again star will also executive produce the series.

Moore and co-showrunner Nikki Toscano said in a joint statement: "We are thrilled that Amanda Seyfried will lead this series about how those initially perceived as victims can band together to regain their power.

“Moore’s family history and her work with harm-reduction and community-service organizations in Philadelphia informed the series, which aims to portray with compassion the lives of those struggling with addiction and the family members who love them.”

The series has not started filming and has no release date yet.

Seyfried recently starred as former entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes in The Dropout – a 2022 Hulu series that charted the events that led to Holmes being convicted for fraud in 2023.

The actor also recently opened up about the possibility of a third Mamma Mia! film.

While speaking with Radio Times in an interview promoting her show The Crowded Room, Seyfried said: "There's lots of talk," before jokingly adding: "I just don't think Universal can afford us."

However, writer-director Ol Parker has previously reiterated that producer Judy Craymer "always plans for it to be a trilogy" – and Craymer herself said at the end of 2023 that it "will happen".

The Dropout is streaming now on Disney+ in the UK and Hulu in the US.
