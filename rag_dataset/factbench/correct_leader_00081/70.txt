Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called moves to replace him in office a “conspiracy woven from inside and out” in a pre-taped televised address Wednesday.

As the battle against Islamic extremist militants rages in the country’s north, the United States and some Iraqi politicians have pushed for al-Maliki to be replaced by a leader that Iraq’s people would perceive as more unifying during the trying times.

The political power struggle reached a breaking point Monday when President Fuad Masum named Haider al-Abadi, the deputy speaker of Parliament, to replace al-Maliki.

Al-Maliki’s opposition has feared that he might put up a political fight, making it harder for al-Abadi to form a government.

On Wednesday, the Prime Minister said political sides must wait for a federal court to decide about his office.

“We need to protect the federal court and its decisions; no one has any ground to go against this court,” al-Maliki said, while not specifically mentioning the name of Prime Minister-designate al-Abadi or any other leaders.
