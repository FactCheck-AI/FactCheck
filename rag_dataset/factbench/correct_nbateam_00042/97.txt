After striking out on big men Tyson Chandler and DeAndre Jordan, the Warriors have agreed to a contract with free-agent center Kwame Brown, Yahoo Sports reported Tuesday morning.

Brown, the former No. 1 overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Washington Wizards, reportedly has agreed to a one-year, $7 million deal with Golden State.

The 29-year-old Brown would likely share center duties with Andris Biedrins with the Warriors, who came in second in the Chandler sweepstakes when he signed with the Knicks last week. Golden State then signed Jordan to a four-year, $43 million offer sheet Sunday, but the Clippers matched the contract for their restricted free agent on Monday.

Brown had a solid season last year with the Charlotte Bobcats, averaging 7.9 points and 6.8 rebounds while starting 50 games. He had signed a one-year contract for the NBA minimum and had a resurgence under Bobcats coach Paul Silas, a former Warriors coach.

Then Washington Wizards president Michael Jordan made Brown the first No. 1 overall draft pick to be selected straight out of high school. Brown, however, has been a major disappointment in the NBA. His best statistical season came in 2003-04 when he had career-highs of 10.9 points and 7.4 rebounds with the Wizards.
