Francois Mauriac, member of the French Academy and Nobel prize winner, last night scored the rearming of a Germany "where the violence of anti-Semitism is undiminished."

M. Mauriac, who presided over the 18th congress of the League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism, told the closing session that "no one is more our brother than the Jews who suffered under the (German) occupation." He called for special efforts to conquer racism by education.
