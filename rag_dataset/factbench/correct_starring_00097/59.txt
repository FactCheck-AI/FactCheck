On Friday, a mini-reunion for the classic teen comedy Mean Girls assembled in Los Angeles. The film's stars, Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Seyfried, and Lacey Chabert, were spotted shooting a commercial on a football field dressed in pink, a nod to their characters from the movie. Lohan played Cady Heron in the 2004 film, a naive girl moving to a U.S. high school after growing up in Africa and finding it difficult to navigate a new social hierarchy.

Seyfried and Chabert were a part of “The Plastics,” the most popular clique in school who accept Cady into the fold, only to find their status quickly disintegrating. Their leader was played by Rachel McAdams as the notorious Regina George, but McAdams did not appear to be on set.

Chabert was photographed in a silver convertible very similar to the one she drove in the original movie, and in another picture Seyfried is talking into a microphone. In Mean Girls, she does the school weather reports. In another photo, Lohan was carrying a bag that reads, “Plastics Club Member,” and the tagline, “On Wednesdays, we wear pink.”

Next year is the 20th anniversary of the movie and it was recently October 3, a date that has a joking significance in the script and which the cast has often marked on social media since its release. Next year is also when Mean Girls Musical Movie is set to hit theaters, an adaptation of the musical of the movie. The new movie and the original were penned by Tina Fey, and she'll be reprising her role as Ms. Norbury in the adaptation.

The gals have been asked about the likelihood they'd make a cameo in the new Mean Girls and in February, Seyfried told Entertainment Tonight that she was “100 percent into” making an appearance.

“It's been a long legacy for Mean Girls, and I think we all kinda just need to hang,” she said.
