Severian is the narrator and author of The Book of the New Sun and The Urth of the New Sun.

He was raised in the Torturers' Guild, and was elevated to the rank of journeyman torturer before he was banished from the guild and the city of Nessus.

At this time he was 6'1", a height that might signify that he is an exultant bastard, and weighed 175 pounds. He is a pale man, with dark eyes and a dark straight hair. He has a long and rather bony face, a high, square forehead, moderately high cheek-bones and a strong chin. He is muscular and his hands are a little larger than average.
