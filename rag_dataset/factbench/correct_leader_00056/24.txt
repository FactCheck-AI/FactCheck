On 6 July 1972 Japan’s prime minister, Satō Eisaku, stepped down in favour of his faction manager, Tanaka Kakuei. Satō had been the longest-serving prime minister in Japanese history, having held office since 1964, and he symbolised a period of unprecedented political stability for Japan. Between 1960 and 1972 only two men had held the office of prime minister but in the next ten years there would be five incumbents of the office. In fact, between the departure of Satō and 1994 only one of Japan’s thirteen prime ministers, Nakasone Yasuhiro, would survive more than two years in office. Paradoxically, this bewildering turnover at the top of government did not seriously loosen the LDP’s grip on power. The party found itself swimming in difficult political waters but showed itself equal to the challenge of a new phase in Japanese politics. The LDP steadily built new bases of support throughout the 1970s, in part by meeting the demands from the new, urban, industrial working and middle classes for more social amenities and greater social welfare, and in part by extending industrial development beyond the great conurbations along the Pacific coast to other parts of Japan.
