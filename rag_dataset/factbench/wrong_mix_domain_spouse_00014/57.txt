Tony Parker responded in kind to wife Eva Longoriaâ€™s filing for divorce.

The San Antonio Spurs player filed his own divorce papers in Texas yesterday, E! News reported, two days after Longoria did the same thing in Los Angeles.

A petition that was obtained by TMZ said: "The marriage insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities between Petitioner and Respondent that destroys the legitimate ends of the marriage relationships and prevents any reasonable expectation of reconciliation."

The actress told friend Mario Lopez that Parker exchanged text messages with the wife of an NBA player, and that it was not the first time that her spouse had cheated on her.

"It is with great sadness that after 7 years together, Tony and I have decided to divorce," Longoria wrote on Twitter Wednesday. "We love each other deeply and pray for each other's happiness."

According to People, the couple had signed a prenup prior to their wedding three years ago in Paris. Longoria is looking to obtain spousal support from the NBA player.
