Eric Hahn started his first company at the age of 11, selling apps for early Altair PCs. By the late 1980s, he was vice president of engineering at cc:Mail, and when Lotus acquired the company, he was named divisional CEO. After his next venture, Collabra Software, was acquired by Netscape, he took over as Netscape's chief technology officer, just in time for the browser wars of the late 1990s. Today, he runs the Inventures Group.

Q: Is it easier developing software in today's PC market than in years past?

A: It's easier in the sense that, once developed, your application runs on hundreds of millions of computers. The downside is that many of these new platforms are controlled, or influenced, by very powerful vendors. You have to choose your applications very wisely because you're in a room filled with giant elephantsâ€” which was less true 15 years ago. Applications companies like Lotus were as large as operating system companies like Microsoft, and that's not true any longer.

Q: Who are the other elephants?

A: Microsoft is clearly the biggest one. But Apple is a slightly smaller one. And Sun controls an awful lot of the agenda on Solaris. At Netscape, we were in the business of building server products for Solaris, and we often felt that Sun was in a position to affect our servers adversely by building one themselves. Anybody who controls the platform tends to have undue sway over the applications that run on it.

Q: Some argue that Microsoft's position cuts down on innovation. Do you agree?
