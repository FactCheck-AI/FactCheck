HOLLYWOOD hunk James Franco and Agyness Deyn are back together... not that anyone actually knew they were an item in the first place.

They were rumoured to be dating last year, shortly after the 127 Hours star split from actress Ahna O’Reilly, but they had a “cooling off period” during which James presented the Oscars.

The couple had never been pictured together until recently when James, 32, posted a few videos online of himself and 28-year-old Agyness chatting inanely about Vietnamese food.

It’s probably “art” or something.
