Wet nurse? Johnny Depp reprised his Edward Scissorhands character in a 20-second cameo for the eleventh season of Family Guy, which airs this Sunday night on Fox

The show's producers use Depp's beloved goth in one of their trademark, non sequitur cutaway gags where he portrays a wet nurse for a naive couple.

On an exclusive video posted on Entertainment Weekly, Johnny is seen adopting his character's vulnerable voice to reassure the young parents that he would take good care of their blonde infant swaddled in a pink blanket.

Edward Scissorhands said: 'Okay, I'm an excellent wet nurse, so you two get some much deserved sleep. Don't worry about a thing. I'm going to take such loving care of this child. And when you two wake up your precious little baby will be smiling as bright as the sun.'
