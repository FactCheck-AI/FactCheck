Biography

Thomas Thurston was a Maryland colonist.

Thomas Thurston was born about 1622 and from Gloucestershire according to the Speedwell passenger list. His brother was known to live in Thernberry. He apparently returned to England and came again on the Woodhouse (1657?) and while persecuted in several colonies was well-treated by the Native Americans who visited him while he was imprisoned in Virginia. About 1665 he fell away from the Quakers and was 'lost to the Truth' and so George Fox tried to reform him on his American journey in 1673.[1][2]

Thomas Thurston was among the first converts of the Quaker faith to visit the colony of Maryland. He was banished from Boston before his travel through Maryland with Josiah Cole and Thomas Champman in 1658. He was made a prisoner in Anne Arundel County for his efforts to seduce the people and the Governor and Council of Maryland issued orders directing Justices of the Peace to seize any Quakers that might come into their districts, and to whip them from Constable to Constable until they should reach the bounds of the province. [3] Anyone helping him would also be in trouble.

He left Maryland for a few years, but returned with his wife and two daughters in 1663 and settled permanently in Maryland. He represented Baltimore County in the Lower House of the MD legislature from 1689-1692.

He was expelled from Maryland for "gross conduct" but was elected to the Assembly in 1688 and excused from taking the oath.[1]

Thurston claimed a large quantity of land via various patents:

1683 Elberton 1000 acs.

1684 Strawberry Hill 200 acs.

1684 Littleton 600 acs.

1684 Come By Chance 200 acs.

Upon the marriage of daughter Ann to Miles Gibson in 1676 he deeded significant property to Miles Gibson.[4]
