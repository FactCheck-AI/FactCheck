I absolutely LOVED watching Gilmore Girls. Not when it was actually on TV – oh no, no – but YEARS after. I fell in love with it and then watched it over and over and over again.

Those were the days.

I loved Rory’s reading addiction and had previously joined the Rory Gilmore Reading Challenge (back on my old blog) and thought it would be fun to join again.

Of course, I doubt I’ll ever get through all of these books, but it’s fun to try, right?
