Actress Kate Winslet has married her partner Ned RocknRoll in a secret ceremony in New York, it has been confirmed.

A representative for Winslet said the private ceremony, held earlier this month, was attended by her two children and "a very few friends and family".

The Oscar-winner has been engaged to Ned Rocknroll, the nephew of Sir Richard Branson, since the summer.

Winslet has previously been married to Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes.

She has a daughter, Mia, with Threapleton, to whom she was married for three years until 2001, and a son, Joe, with director Mendes, from whom she split in 2010.

Details of the New York wedding have been kept private, but People magazine reported actor Leonardo DiCaprio attended.

DiCaprio and Winslet starred together in the hugely successful Titanic movie, and teamed up again for Revolutionary Road, a grim inspection of married life in suburbia, which was directed by Mendes.

Winslet and RocknRoll were at Sir Richard's Caribbean retreat Necker Island in 2011 when a fire devastated the Virgin boss's luxury home.

Sir Richard praised Winslet for helping his elderly mother to safety.

Rocknroll, who changed his name from Abel Smith, works for his uncle's space flight company, Virgin Galactic.
