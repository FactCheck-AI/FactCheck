Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet and her director husband Sam Mendes have separated after nearly seven years of marriage, the British couple's lawyer has said. The Hollywood A-listers' split was "amicable."

Winslet, winner of the 2009 best actress Oscar for "The Reader", married Mendes, awarded the Academy Award for best director in 2000 for "American Beauty", in May 2003.

"Kate and Sam are saddened to announce that they separated earlier this year. The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement," London lawyer Keith Schilling said in a statement Monday.

"Both parties are fully committed to the joint parenting of their children," Schilling added. "They ask that the media respect the privacy of the family."

Winslet and Mendes have a six-year-old son, Joe, and Winslet has a nine-year-old daughter, Mia, from her previous marriage to Jim Threapleton, an assistant director she met while making the low-budget "Hideous Kinky".
