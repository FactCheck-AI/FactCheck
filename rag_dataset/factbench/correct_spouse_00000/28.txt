London, England (CNN) -- Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet has split from her husband, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, after almost seven years of marriage, a lawyer for the couple said Monday.

The separation happened "earlier this year," Keith Schilling said.

"The split is entirely amicable and is by mutual agreement," Shilling said. "Both parties are fully committed to the future joint parenting of their children."

Winslet, 34, and Mendes, 44, have a 6-year-old son, and she has a 9-year-old daughter from her previous marriage.

Winslet, nominated for Academy Awards six times, won the best actress Oscar in 2008 for her role in "The Reader."

Mendes won a best director Oscar in 1999 for "American Beauty."
