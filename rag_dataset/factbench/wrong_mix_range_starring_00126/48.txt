Remember Ashley Dewitt of Disney’s Hannah Montana?

The star who played her role Anna Maria Perez de Tagle finally tied the knot over the weekend with partner who is also half-Filipino, Scott Kline Jr.

Wearing an Oliver Tolentino dress with a 10-meter veil and an 8.5-meter train, she walked down the aisle at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Angels in downtown Los Angeles.

Perez de Tagle is the granddaughter of Original Pilipino Music (OPM) icon Sylvia la Torre.

It was no less than her grandmother who sang a beautiful rendition of “Ave Maria” during her wedding.

Perez de Tagle previously met her husband afer they were set up by her cousin. The former Disney star shared their first date even happened in Disneyland.

In their engagement (www.happilyeverkline.com), the Hannah Montana star said Kline looked at life the same way she did and “respected her old-fashioned, Filipina values.”

She immediately fell in love with Kline who courted her in the traditional Filipino way.
