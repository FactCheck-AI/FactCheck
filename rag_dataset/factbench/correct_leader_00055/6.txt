TOKYO -- Shinzo Abe became Japan's longest-serving postwar prime minister Friday with 2,798 days in office and is just months away from becoming the longest overall.

As of that day, Abe had served as many days in office as Eisaku Sato, who became prime minister a month or so after Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympics. Sato was the brother of Abe's grandfather.
