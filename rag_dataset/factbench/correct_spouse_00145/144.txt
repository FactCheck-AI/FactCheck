Katy Perry has posted to social media for the first time since her ex-husband, Russell Brand, was accused of rape and sexual assault as a result of a joint between The Sunday Times and Dispatches.

The Firework singer, who is now in a relationship with Orlando Bloom, posted an image of her on a scooter, modeling a pair of shoes from her new line of cowboy boots.

Attention has been focused on Perry since an interview surfaced of her discussing her relationship with Brand, in which she claimed she ‘found out the real truth’ about the comedian.

Reflecting on their time together, Perry revealed the complexities of their relationship. ‘At first when I met him, he wanted an equal, and I think a lot of times strong men do want an equal, but then they get that equal and they’re like, “I can’t handle the equalness,”’ she said.

Katy Perry was married to Russell Brand for 14 months.

Perry described Brand’s attitude towards her professional stature as ‘very controlling’, especially during her tours, causing a significant strain on their relationship.

‘I felt a lot of responsibility for it ending, but then I found out the real truth,’ she said, though not revealing any specifics, ‘I keep it locked in my safe for a rainy day.’

Perry's post comes after Brand's YouTube channel, which has a following of 6.6 million, was suspended from making money from adverts in the wake of the allegations against him, which he has denied.
