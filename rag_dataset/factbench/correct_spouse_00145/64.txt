Katy Perry and Russell Brand met in 2009 during the filming of "Get Him to the Greek."

The couple got engaged in early 2010 and married in a private ceremony in October 2010 in India.

Russell Brand filed for divorce from Katy Perry in December 2011, ending their 14-month marriage.

Perry received the breakup message via text, which was documented in her 2012 movie, Part of Me.

Brand cited irreconcilable differences and career conflicts as reasons for their divorce.
