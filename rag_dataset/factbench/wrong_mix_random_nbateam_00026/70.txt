âServant's Heart Award: Raveena Vij '21

Fostering an attitude of service to others is a very important part of educating the mind and the heart, taking our Lord Jesus Christ as the ultimate role model, as the one who "did not come to be served, but to serve."

The Servant's Heart Award honors that senior who high school career has clearly displayed an attitude of serving othersâat school, at church, and in the community. The recipient possesses a willing hand and a servant's heart, and has performed numerous selfless acts of willing and cheerful service, not for self but for the greater glory of God.

Katharine O.Â Dunham Award for Citizenship: Becket Pricer '21

The Dunham School Honor Code forms the basis for all conduct policies and is the primary building block of the school community. We believe that each student should have a strong sense of personal honor and integrity and that these character qualities will be vital assets throughout life.

In recognition of the important role that the Honor Code plays in the life of our school and that of our students, this award is given to the senior whose conduct and character exemplify The Dunham School Honor Code.

âHall of Fame Award: Carlos Stewart '21

Chosen by the faculty, the Hall of Fame Award is presented each year to the senior who has brought the greatest possible positive community recognition to The Dunham School during the course of his/her high school career.

As the most accomplished basketball player in Dunham history this recipient has been a two-time State Champion, two-time State and District MVP in Class 2A and a three-time All State Player. He leaves Dunham with several school records and has earned the respect of the Baton Rouge basketball community for his tenacious play and outstanding ability to push himself to excellence. He is respected and admired by his teammates and coaches for his uncompromising work ethic and has gained the respect of local sportswriters for his outstanding team play.

He has garnered almost every possible award: Louisiana's Mr. Basketball, Max Preps Player of the Year, NAACP Louisiana Player of the Year, and the The Advocate's Basketball Star of Stars. While talented athletically, his true character is displayed through the compassion he has for family, friends and teammates. Basketball has been his platform to honor God. He will continue to do that as he plays basketball on a full scholarship next year at Santa Clara University.
