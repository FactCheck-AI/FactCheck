Jules G. Verne was a French writer known as one of the earliest science fiction authors. He came from a sea-faring family, hence the setting for many of his novels. His most well-known stories are his series of novels known as “Les voyages extraordinaires” (“Extraordinary Voyages”): Voyage au centre de la terre (Journey to the Center of the Earth), De la terre à la lune (From the Earth to the Moon), Vingt mille lieues sous les mers (Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), and Le tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours (Around the World in Eighty Days). Most of his stories were first serialized in periodicals before being published in book form.
