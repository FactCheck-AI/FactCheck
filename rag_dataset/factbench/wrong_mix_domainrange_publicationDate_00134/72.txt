Early Life Develops Wanderlust and Imagination

Jules Verne was born in the busy seaport of Nantes, France in 1828. As a child, Verne had a wanderlust fueled by reading adventure stories and watching ships arrive from exotic destinations. He snuck aboard ships to imaginary distant shores beyond the horizon.

Verne moved to Paris in 1847 to study law at his father‘s insistence. But his heart wasn‘t in dusty law books. He found himself drawn to literature and the theater. Verne began writing short comedy plays in his free time.

After receiving his law degree in 1851, Verne took a day job as a stockbroker. This gave him financial security to pursue writing. He rose early each morning to work on stories before heading to the stock exchange.

Big Breakthrough Working With Hetzel Publishing

In 1857, Jules Verne met Pierre-Jules Hetzel, an enterprising publisher who would launch his career. Verne gave Hetzel the manuscript for his debut novel Five Weeks in a Balloon. Hetzel recognized Verne‘s talent for thrilling science-driven adventure and published the book in 1863.

The novel follows a light-hearted expedition across Africa in a balloon, with narrow escapes from danger at every turn. Five Weeks in a Balloon became a smash hit and bestseller. This marked the beginning of an immensely productive collaboration between Verne and Hetzel‘s publishing house.

For the rest of his career, Verne contracted to publish two books a year with Hetzel. The deal allowed Verne to become a full-time author and take his writing to new heights of imagination.

Classic Sci-Fi Novels That Inspired Generations

Some of Verne‘s most popular sci-fi titles published with Hetzel include:

Journey to the Center of the Earth (1864) – A professor leads an expedition down an Icelandic volcano to explore the unknown depths below.

From the Earth to the Moon (1865) – Members of a post-Civil War gun club construct a giant cannon to launch themselves to the moon.

Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870) – A strange giant sea creature is revealed to be a highly advanced submarine, the Nautilus, helmed by the mysterious Captain Nemo.

Around the World in Eighty Days (1873) – A gentleman named Phileas Fogg attempts to travel across the globe in under 80 days on a bet.

These stories fused rip-roaring adventure with pioneering science fiction concepts. Verne reveled in conjuring up futuristic submarines, spacecraft, and other innovations decades before they became reality. He awed readers with his technological prophecies.

Lasting Popularity and Acclaim

During his lifetime, Jules Verne achieved great fame and success. By his death in 1905, his books were translated into numerous languages and devoured by readers internationally.

But more than just a popular author, Verne inspired generations of writers. Sci-fi pioneers including H.G. Wells, Ray Bradbury, and Arthur C. Clarke all owed a debt to Verne for paving the way for their own futuristic works.

Beyond fiction, Verne motivated real-world scientific advancement. Engineers were spurred by Verne‘s vivid descriptions of submarines and rockets to make them a reality. He demonstrated science fiction‘s power to captivate while spreading knowledge and optimism about human progress.

Later Years: Politics and Playwriting

His science fiction output slowed, but he published the darker dystopian novel Paris in the Twentieth Century in 1994, along with the adventure tale The Lighthouse at the End of the World (1905).
