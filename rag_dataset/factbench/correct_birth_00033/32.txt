Gerald R. Ford became president in 1974 after Nixon resigned. While his presidency is rather memorable, not many people realize that Ford was born in Omaha. Today, the house he lived in as an infant is gone, but in its place is a breathtaking little oasis where you can relax, enjoy nature, and maybe even learn something new.
