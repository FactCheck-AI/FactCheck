Ryan Phillippe has denied that he was dumped by Abbie Cornish.

The Cruel Intentions star, who has two children called Ava and Deacon with ex-wife Reese Witherspoon, is now single after more than three years with Australian actress Cornish.

Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for Cornish said: "Abbie ended it and moved out." She was later spotted leaving his LA home.

However, Phillippe's representative has now told The Daily Telegraph: "Ryan ended the relationship recently while she was in Australia. [Ryan] asked her to remove her belongings from his house, which she did this weekend."
