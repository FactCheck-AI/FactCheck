In 2008, Ray Allen helped the Boston Celtics to an NBA title. It was the franchiseâs first title since 1986 and a wonderful moment for the city of Boston and Celtics fans everywhere.

Unfortunately, many players on that team â Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, Rajon Rondo â have distanced themselves from Allen, still upset that he joined the Miami Heat in free agency and won an NBA title with LeBron James.

Allen, 45, is at peace with the situation.

âI donât worry about it,â the Hall of Famer said on The DA Show. âIâve got to the point, life is too short. You have to chalk it up in the life-is-too-short category. Life is good.â

Allen, an Olympic gold medalist and 10-time All-Star, is focused on raising his five children. He has four sons and one daughter.

âIâm trying to figure out a way to keep them going and understand the game of basketball,â he said. âThey already love it. Iâm just trying to put them in positions where they can be successful and live a happy life. The people who are in my life, they mean so much to me, and thatâs all that matters.â
