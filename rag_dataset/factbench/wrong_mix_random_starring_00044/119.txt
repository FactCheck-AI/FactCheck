LONDON: British actress Liz Hurley's four-year marriage to Indian businessman Arun Nayar ended in divorce Wednesday amid continued speculation about her romance with Australian cricketer Shane Warne.

Hurley and textile tycoon Nayar were granted a divorce at a London court, although neither of them attended the hearing.

The couple married in March, 2007, in a star-studded ceremony at Sudeley Castle in southwest England, and had a second traditional Hindu ceremony at a palace in Jodhpur, northwest India.

Hurley, 46, revealed in December that she had split from Nayar, telling her followers on microblogging site Twitter: “For the record, my husband Arun and I separated a few months ago.”

It came after photographs were published of the actress and Warne apparently kissing and cuddling together in London.

The cricketer, 41, reportedly met Hurley at an English race meeting in July last year and the pair have since been spotted together on several occasions.

Hurley was photographed cheering on Warne at an Indian Premier League match in northwest India in April.

Warne's romances have sparked almost as much media attention as his performance in cricket matches and his energetic love life is widely thought to have cost him the Australian captaincy.

He brought the curtain down on his two-decade career at an Indian Premier League match last month, several years after he retired from international cricket.

Hurley and actor Hugh Grant were one of Britain's leading celebrity couples in the 1990s but separated in 2000.
