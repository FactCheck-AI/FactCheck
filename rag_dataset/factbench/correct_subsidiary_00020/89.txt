Normally, there are several tabs when viewing docs in a SharePoint - “new”, “upload”, “actions” and “settings”. For some SharePoint sites, I only see “actions” and therefore am unable to download files to that SharePoint or checkout docs from that SharePoint.

if you are in the document library it is probably security, however if you are on the main page, looking at the web part, it could be the web part settings. select the site actions, edit page, then edit on the library you are having issues with. click modify shared web part… then check the toolbar settings on the right when it opens up. the choices are no toolbar, summary toolbar, and full tool bar… check full tool bar then apply, then save and exit edit mode…

If you are in the library directly it is probably security, but if you are in the webpart (on the main page) it could be that the web part is configured to show only no toolbar or summary tool bar… go to the site actions, edit page, edit the webpart with the doc library, then modify shared webpart, then check the toolbar setting, full , summary or no toolbar…
