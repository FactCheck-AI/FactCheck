The other day ...

I was working on the SharePoint pages after so many years and realised our favorite SP is not the same anymore ! I am not here to point my finger to the fact that how adding your code to a page was so much easier before, just by dropping a content editor web part or the script editor web part (or using Embed code) in edit mode. Both of these are now unavailable in new SharePoint online modern pages.

However, I actually feel like the modern pages are filled with way more features and they look super clean in the edit mode as well, even after adding so many webparts . It also supports several 'out of the box/pre-added' webparts for smaller things such as 'youtube-video', 'Spacer', and 'images' etc.

Before we proceed, please note that you can still add a classic page to your new SharePoint site and still add your code/webpart the way you were doing in some of the older versions ( SP 2010/ 2013). It goes like this :

Enter Sharepoint Classic experience . You can do this from All Site pages > left side navigation (multiple ways)

Then add a webpart page

Then you will have a classic page to edit ( the old way)

Now, coming back to the Modern Page enhancements : -

If you want to add your own HTML/CSS/JS you will need a place where you can add your own code (obviously!). You can download a compiled version from many sources available in the internet or if you want to compile the project yourself, you will get the source code as well.

Before you follow the rest of the steps, depending on your organization's policy and site permission you may want to check your Site Owner's control panel - /SitePages/Site-Owners-Control-Panel.aspx , as you won't see the functionality to directly upload any SPFx packages unless you have a superior access.

If you are not a site collection admin then enable the below two features, which will allow you to upload a new SPFx (SharePoint Framework) package and edit the scripts.

Here are the steps at a high level:

Build the SPFx solution package.

You can build the SPFx solution package from https://github.com/pnp/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-script-editor. I downloaded the file directly from here :https://www.sharepointdiary.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pzl-script-editor.sppkg

Upload and deploy the .sppkg file to your site's App catalog.(/AppCatalog/Forms/AllItems.aspx)

Now you will find the app under 'SharePoint Apps'(_layouts/15/appStore.aspx/)

All done!

Now simply create a new page or chose from the existing gallery of modern pages. Apply theme if you want to and drop the newly added webparts

Edit the web part to add your code as usual

Happy days again ! ! !
