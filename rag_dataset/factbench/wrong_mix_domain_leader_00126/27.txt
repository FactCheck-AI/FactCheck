KABUL, Afghanistan (January 26, 2010) — NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen announced his decision to appoint Ambassador Mark Sedwill as NATO's new Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan.

Sedwill, who is currently the British ambassador to Afghanistan, is due to take office after the London Conference on Jan. 28.

“Ambassador Sedwill is eminently qualified to take up this position” Rasmussen said. “He knows the country, the Afghan people and the Afghan Government. He knows the region: he has been the British Deputy High Commissioner in Pakistan, which is clearly a very valuable background for his new position.”

Sedwill will succeed Ambassador Fernando Gentilini, who served as NATO’s fourth Senior Civilian Representative in Afghanistan from May 2008 to January 2010.

“Ambassador Gentilini has done an excellent job,” Rasmussen said. “I would like to congratulate him for his dedication, his energy, and his determination to help the Afghan people build a better future.”
