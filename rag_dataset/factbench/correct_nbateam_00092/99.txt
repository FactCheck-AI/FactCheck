Later tonight, the Timberwolves are going to welcome Kevin Love back to the Target Center in Minnesota for the first time since they traded him to the Cavaliers back in August. Er, or are they? Love will be there. But it seems the T'Wolves are much more excited to welcome a different former player back to the building.

He's also on the Cavs now. He used to play for Minnesota back in 2008 and 2009. He'sâ€¦Mike Miller? Ha. Just watch the hype video above to see what we mean. We love what you did here, guys.
