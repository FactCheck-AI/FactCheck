Niels Bohr (1885-1962) was a Danish physicist and winner of the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Bohr began his work on the Manhattan Project after fleeing to Sweden from Denmark because of German occupation in 1943. Originally he was brought to London, working with the British Tube Alloys nuclear weapons development team. Bohr was eventually brought to the United States, and worked at Los Alamos under the pseudonym Nicholas Baker, as a knowledgeable consultant.

He flew back and forth between London, Washington, and Los Alamos for the next two years. Both during and after the Manhattan Project, Bohr supported peaceful applications of atomic energy and openness between nations with regard to nuclear weapons.
