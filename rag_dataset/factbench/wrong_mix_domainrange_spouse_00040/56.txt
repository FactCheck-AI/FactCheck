Apparently Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher aren’t the only former spouses and new husbands who get along like best of friends.

Hugh Grant tagged along with Elizabeth Hurley, her five-year-old son Damian and Hurley’s new businessman husband, Arun Nayar, to Seychelles island, off the East coast of Africa, where they vacationed on October 24.

Hugh Grant, Liz Hurley & Arun Nayar: Two’s company… three’s a crowd?

Elizabeth Hurley, 42, and Hugh Grant, 47, certainly weathered a lot over the course of a 13-year relationship, namely him appearing in many romantic comedies, as well as soliciting oral sex from a cheap hooker, before parting ways in 2000.

But Elizabeth Hurley has maintained they remain close friends.

In fact, the handsome actor is even one of Damian’s godfathers, and was even invited to Elizabeth Hurley’s fabulous March nuptials with Arun Nayar.

The actor was a no-show, however, because he did not want to create a media craze and take the attention away from the Austin Powers star’s big day with Nayar.
