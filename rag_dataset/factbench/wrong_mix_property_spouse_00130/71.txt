Amy Poehler and Will Arnett's funny family is growing.

A rep for the "Parks and Recreation" star confirms that Poehler, 38, is pregnant with her second child. Further information, including a due date, has not been released.

The new addition will join big brother Archie, 16 months, whom the former "Saturday Night Live" cast member delivered in Oct. 2008.

Known for their healthy senses of humor, Poehler and Arnett, 39, take parenthood a bit more seriously.

"As sort of clichéd as it sounds, it's just the best,” notes former "Arrested Development" star Arnett. "Because it's a human being that you're responsible for ... that's scary, but even in its scariest moments it's fantastic."
