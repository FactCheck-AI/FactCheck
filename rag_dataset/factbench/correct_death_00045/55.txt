Country great Waylon Jennings was laid to rest Friday following a private graveside service in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, Ariz. As previously reported, Jennings died Wednesday at his Arizona home after a long battle with diabetes-related health problems. He was 64.

A spokesperson said the singer was buried after the graveside service, but declined to provide details, saying that Jennings’ final wish was for a quiet funeral without fanfare.

Jennings’ widow, Jessi Colter, said through the spokesperson that she hoped to disclose plans next week for a public memorial service in Nashville.
