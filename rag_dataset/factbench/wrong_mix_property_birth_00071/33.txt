The Isley Brothers, Kris Kristofferson, Kraftwerk, Zydeco artist Clifton Chenier, composer Amando Manzanero and violinist Maud Powell also received Lifetime Achievement Awards at the ceremony. Manzanero’s recognition marks the first time the Recording Academy honored a Mexican with the award.

“It’s a Lifetime Achievement Award, but I feel like we’ve all got a lot more life left in us,” Starr reportedly said. “It’s a great afternoon; it’s all about music. . . . The Beatles‘ music is still out there and that’s what I’m most proud of.”

Starr reportedly mugged and pretended to look dismayed as Ono gave a lengthy speech. “I’m here today because I think John would have wanted me to be here,” she said. Starr produced a cell phone and pretended to make a call as she spoke and leaned forward to get her attention later. Starr who admitted he hadn’t prepared a speech said, “I really want to say thank you.”
