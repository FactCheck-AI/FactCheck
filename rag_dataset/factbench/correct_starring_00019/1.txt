In Love Actually, Rowan Atkinson saves Sam (and Daniel) whilst he helps Sam run and talk to Joanna to express his 'love' for her at Heathrow Airport.

Rowan Atkinson's character turns up at the check-in desk and asks the check-in staff to hold several items after then declaring that he has left his boarding pass where he was having a cup of coffee (all whilst Neeson's character Daniel is saying to his son: Sam, that he can't see Joanna, because they won't allow it):

ROWAN'S character:

I'm sorry, I must have left it where I was having a cup of coffee

Only, Rowan's exit in that scene is left with a very slight eyebrow raise to Daniel, Liam Neeson's character.

Did Rowan's character do this on purpose? Stall the check-in worker on purpose?

Is this supported by any further evidence that I have missed, or was it intentionally 'leave it for the audience'?
