Although the Golden State Warriorsâ€™ addition of Kevin Durant took place nearly three years ago, former Cleveland Cavaliers forward Richard Jefferson took a shot at the 2014 MVP on Sunday.

As the news got out, Durant made sure to respond to the criticism in a comment on Instagram:

Durant, 30, left the Oklahoma City Thunder to join the Warriors back in the summer of 2016. The shocking relocation took place months after the Cavs beat the 73-9 Warriors in the NBA Finals. Jefferson was on that historic Cavs team that dethroned the Warriors and brought the Cavs organization its first championship in franchise history.

While the Cavs were the defending champions the following year, there was no beating a team with NBA greats Durant and Stephen Curry in their prime. Although the Cavs matched up with the Warriors in the NBA Finals again in 2017 and 2018, they were destroyed easily as Durant won Finals MVP both years.
