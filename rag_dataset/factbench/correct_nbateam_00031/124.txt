The Warriors will begin their title defense on Tuesday night against the Los Angeles Lakers, and a few ESPN analysts are calling Golden State the favorite to capture another ring.

In a segment on ESPN, Zach Lowe said we could be in for one of the most wide-open title races we’ve seen in a long time – but Richard Jefferson believes the defending champion Warriors are head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.

Jefferson: “I don’t know what Zach is talking about. If the Golden State Warriors are healthy, with the roster that they have — what we’ve seen from (James) Wiseman, the growth of (Jonathan) Kuminga, what they’ve got with Donte DiVincenzo — there is no team out there that…”

Lowe: “You’re taking Warriors over (the) field?! You’re that high on the Warriors?”

Jefferson: “If they stay healthy … they are the best team.”

Chiney Owgumike also picked the Warriors as favorites, but acknowledged there are several other elite teams in play.
