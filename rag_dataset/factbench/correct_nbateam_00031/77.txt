Richard Jefferson was drafted in 2001 by the Houston Rockets, was immediately dealt to the New Jersey (!) Nets and made an immediate impact on a winning team. With Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, he was a part of a core that went to consecutive NBA Finals in 2002 and 2003.

Jefferson would make a few stops during his career, landing playing for the Milwaukee Bucks, San Antonio Spurs, Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, and Dallas Mavericks before finally winning a title with the Cleveland Cavaliers (unfortunately against the Warriors).

In his prime, Jefferson was one of the best in-game dunkers during his era and one of those guys whose presence was felt in every locker room he found himself in. As his game began to decline in the latter years of his career, he moved into more of a mentor role, providing insight and advice for younger players looking to make a name for themselves in the league.

Jefferson’s announcement came with another, more unfortunate declaration. His father passed away, who he talked about in an Instagram post.

Jefferson spent a year and a half with the Warriors, primarily in a reserve role as the team as we know it now was being imagined. Jefferson’s presence in the NBA will be missed.
