Located in the storied Century Towers, this two-bedroom, three bath condo has an impressive, pedigreed history. According to the listing, the positively cavernous 2,800-square-foot unit was the former home of legendary actor (and accomplished circus performer) Burt Lancaster, who died in 1994.

Though the towers themselves were designed by Pritzker Prize winner I. M. Pei, the listing notes that this particular condo is the work of another influential modernist: the great Hal Levitt.

Comprised of two corner units that were combined to form one continuous space, the condo features red tile flooring, white columns and arches, and large, exposed beams across the ceiling—giving it a Spanish Colonial Revival style rarely (if ever) seen in modern high-rises. The Century Towers were built in 1964.

The unit also includes an open kitchen and dining room area, along with a great room with built-in shelving and floor-to-ceiling windows that offer impressive views into the neighboring Hillcrest Country Club and beyond. The building itself has a long list of amenities, including a tennis court, pool, fitness center, and Finnish sauna.

Of course, all those perks come at a high price. HOA dues appear to be an astonishing $2,995 per month—a few dollars more than the median price of rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles. The condo is available for purchase at $2.65 million or for rent at $8,400 per month.
