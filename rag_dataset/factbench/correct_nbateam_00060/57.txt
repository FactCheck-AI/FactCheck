Metta World Peace wishes he could go back in time and prevent the Malice at the Palace between his Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons.

The former Pacers forward took to Twitter to ponder about a career rewind.

The Malice at the Palace is widely considered the biggest fight in NBA history. After getting into a scuffle with Pistons center Ben Wallace, Metta World Peace went into the stands after a fan threw a drink at him and all hell broke loose from there.

Now granted, World Peace was able to redeem himself with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2010 when he won his lone NBA championship with Kobe Bryant over the Boston Celtics. However, the Malice at the Palace will always come back to haunt the former Pacers forward in some capacity.

World Peace, formerly known as Ron Artest, finished his Pacers career with averages of 16.5 points, 5.2 rebounds and 3.0 assists in 193 games. His NBA career saw him play for the Chicago Bulls, Sacramento Kings, Houston Rockets and New York Knicks as well. Peace averaged 13.2 points, 4.5 boards and 2.7 assists in 991 NBA games.

During the 2003-04 season with the Pacers, Peace won the Defensive Player of the Year Award. He may have been a hothead with Indiana, but there is no denying Peace's elite defensive skills. He was a pest on that end of the floor and always found a way to impact the game even if his shot wasn't falling on offense.
