The newÂ Guinness World Records 2017 Edition contains an exclusive foreword by lunar explorer and space scientist Dr Edwin E. âBuzzâ Aldrin Jr, a man who will forever be known for the central role he played in the First manned landing on the moon in 1969.

Â

This yearâs book is inspired by two major themes of record-breaking: the conquest of space and pioneering adventures â topics which Buzz, a multiple record-holder, is undoubtedly qualified to talk about.

Â

Â

The astronautâs debut record-setting experience took place during the Gemini 12 mission back in 1966, when Buzz took the First selfie in open space.

Â

âI just opened the hatch and looked around,â Buzz told us, âjust like a sightseeing tourist would. I saw the camera and thought, âI wonder what would happen if I took a picture of meâ, not knowing whether it would turn out at all! The lighting was not too well selected, but you could tell who it was.â

Â

Three years later on Apollo 11, Buzz and Neil made the first ever human landing on the surface of the Moon.

Â

Guinness World Records Editor-In-Chief Craig Glenday caught up with Buzz in London earlier this year to talk about his remarkable achievements.

Â

The 86-year-old remains passionate about the continuing discoveries in outer space and is currently interested in Mars in particular: âThe children born between the years 2000 and 2010 will be the ones making the first landings on Mars. And itâs those kids that we would like to ensure are enthusiastic about the future,â he says.

Buzz was recently evacuated from Antarctica after suffering a health scare during a tourist visit. He was discharged from hospital a couple of weeks ago and we wish him all the best with his continued recovery.
