Website load time is an important factor, because Google is taking the site’s loading speed into consideration in determining its ranking. Even though this will not have a big impact, it is still something we (webmasters) should really look into. The reason is pretty simple – the majority of visitors are usually in a rush and no one is fond of waiting half a century before the website finally loads its content or fails to load.
