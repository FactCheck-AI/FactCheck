The star studded and Christmas favourite Love Actually, will come alive across the UK in winter 2024, with a full orchestra performing its soundtrack live to screen.

Love Actually In Concert has become an annual festive tradition for many, gathering numerous sold out audiences in previous years.

Written and directed by Richard Curtis and initially released in 2003, Love Actually follows 10 different, yet all interweaving stories of love around the festive period.

Boasting an all-star cast, Love Actually features Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, Laura Linney, Bill Nighy, Martine McCutcheon, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightley, Rowan Atkinson, Martin Freeman and many more.

A full, live orchestra will perform Craig Armstrong’s scores at each show, with the film being projected onto a vast screen. Armstrong is perhaps one of the UK’s most recognised film composers, with his work being awarded a BAFTA for his Achievement in Film Music.
