Jessie Wallace and Dave Morgan's relationship ended in April

The ex-fiance of EastEnders actress Jessie Wallace has agreed not to disclose any more details about their relationship, the High Court has heard.

Last week Ms Wallace lost a court bid to block the publication of a News of the World interview with David Morgan, the estranged father of her daughter.

The pair have agreed to enter a process of "mediation", her solicitor said.

Wallace plays Kat Moon in the BBC soap. Mr Morgan, 29, is currently appearing in Five's reality series The Farm.

'No reconciliation'

Ms Wallace and Mr Morgan have promised not to publish any "personal, private or confidential information" concerning their relationship with each other, "pending the successful conclusion of mediation".

Her solicitor Simon Smith said the move was "not with a view to reconciliation" but "to see who can say what in the future".

The agreement will not prevent a second instalment of Mr Morgan's News of the World interview being published on Sunday.

Ms Wallace, who gave birth to daughter Tallulah Lilac last November, ended her relationship with Mr Morgan last month.

Last week Mr Justice Smith rejected Ms Wallace's bid to block the interview's publication, saying he was satisfied she had forfeited her right to privacy.

On Thursday Mr Morgan discussed the relationship with fellow contestants on The Farm.

The policeman-turned-fireman said: "I still love her and stuff, you know. I'd go back tomorrow if she said 'go back'."
