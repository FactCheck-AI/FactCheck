They've been enjoying a relaxing beach break in Barbados.

And Zoe Salmon and her husband William Corrie were calling it a day on Thursday as they prepared to jet out of Barbados following their romantic getaway.

The former Blue Peter presenter, 38, was in high spirits as she arrived at the airport ahead of her flight, flashing a beaming grin.

Zoe was dressed to impress for her flight in a boho inspired dress in a muted, earthy tone.

She carried her travel essentials in a black leather handbag and opted for comfort with coordinating black sandals.

The TV personality wore her hair down loose and protected her eyes behind a pair of giant sunglasses.

Zoe and William are known to be fans of the holiday hot spot, after eloping to the island to get hitched two years ago.

The couple were together for five years before tying the knot, after meeting at a friend's wedding in Castle Leslie, County Monaghan - where Sir Paul McCartney famously married Heather Mills in 2002.

Zoe's romance with William comes after she dated another fellow Northern Irish man - former Hollyoaks actor Gerard McCarthy.

The pair split in 2009 after 18 months, with Gerard declaring 'there's plenty more Salmon in the sea' following the end of their romance.

The blonde started her career when she won Miss Northern Ireland in 1999, before turning her attention to presenting.

She co-hosted iconic children's show Blue Peter to 2004 until 2008, and went on to appear as a contestant on Dancing On Ice in 2009.
