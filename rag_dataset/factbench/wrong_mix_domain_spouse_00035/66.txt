FORMER Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon has married in a secret ceremony in Barbados.

The former Miss Northern Ireland tied the knot with William Corrie after eloping.

Mr Corrie (30) is a popular Co-Down butcher who asked the 36-year-old model and actress to marry him while they holidayed in Barbados last November.

The new Mrs Corrie was one of Northern Ireland's most eligible bachelorettes until her surprise wedding.

She recently turned the DUP down when the party invited her to stand in the East Belfast constituency for this week's Assembly elections.

However, she has not ruled out a politicial career in the future.

The 36-year-old told Hello! about her private nuptials at the exclusive Sandy Lane beach resort, which boasts A-listers like Rihanna and Oprah Winfrey as fans.

It is also the resort where golfer Tiger Woods got married in 2004.

She said: "I can't wait to get home and tell everyone. I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.

"We'll have a big party when we get home, I'm sure of that."

She added: "I want an excuse to wear my dress and feel the magic again."

Revealing her wedding details exclusively to Hello!, she disclosed her dress of choice was a beaded gown with a long train from wedding designer, Berta.

"When I saw Zoe arrive I thought, 'Wow!'", Corrie said, of seeing his bride in her dress.

Salmon added: "What was so lovely was that every single conversation we had that day was with each other. It was really intimate and we had so much space to breathe and take in every special moment."
