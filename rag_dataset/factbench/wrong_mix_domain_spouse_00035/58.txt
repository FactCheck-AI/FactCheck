Former beauty queen and Blue Peter presenter Zoe Salmon has secretly married her Prince Charming, William Corrie, in Barbados. The couple, who first met at a mutual friendâ€™s wedding five years ago, revealed that they were following family tradition by eloping.

"I can't wait to get home and tell everyone," said Zoe, who wed at the luxurious Sandy Lane beach resort, haunt of the rich and famous.

"I didn't even tell my mum and dad, although running off to get married does run in the family so they will be thrilled for us.

The ceremony ended with a kiss before the newlyweds kicked off their shoes and headed for the beach.

"What was so lovely was that every single conversation we had that day was with each other," said Zoe. "It was really intimate and we had so much space to breathe and take in every special moment."
