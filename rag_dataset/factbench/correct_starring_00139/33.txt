"Ed Wood" is a Tim Burton classic that never got quite the reward it deserved at the box office (like most Burton films). The film is brilliant in its portrayal of the life of Hollywood director Ed Wood, an interesting, unique, eccentric and, well, you get the picture type of character.

Johnny Depp has a field day here...this may be Depp's finest performance, and certainly far above "Pirates of the Caribbean." Depp was nominated for a Golden Globe for this performance, but failed to get an Oscar nomination. This, in my opinion, was a travesty. Depp inhabits this character...lives as Ed Wood and creates a multi-faceted, intriguing character where many actors would have gone for caricature. It's a beautiful performance.

Martin Landau won every award known to man in his supporting role here, including the Oscar. As Bela Lugosi, Landau is simply brilliant...he brings an emotion to this character...and yet a humor...it's an incredible balance that Landau pulled off in every scene.

I've never been a Sarah Jessica Parker fan, but she is simply marvelous here as Wood's girlfriend. Additionally, Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Jones and Vincent D'Onofrio all make nice turns here. Smaller appearances entertain here including Bill Murray, Lisa Marie and pretty much the entire supporting cast.

Unlike most Wood films, this film features wonderful cinematography and Oscar-winning make-up. The direction of Burton is stellar...quite simply, this is an under-rated and beautiful gem of filmmaking
