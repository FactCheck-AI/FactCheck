HOBOKEN, NJ â€” According to notices taped up in local neighborhoods and information on social media, Timothee Chalamet's new movie "A Complete Unknown," a Bob Dylan biopic, will be filming at a vegan restaurant in downtown Jersey City this Wednesday through Friday.

Subia's Vegan Cafe at 506 Jersey Ave. has been transformed into "Village Artists" for the shoot, said the Downtown Special Improvement District on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, actor/writer Ed Burns' new movie "Miller by Marriage" returns to Hoboken on Wednesday, April 16. Signs posted in the neighborhood of Tenth through Eleventh streets say the crew will be filming interior scenes, as they were two weeks ago (see prior story here).

The notice around town says they'll be filming just Wednesday, but multiple "NO PARKING" signs on Washington Street say parking is prohibited during the day through Sunday.
