Linen Backing a poster on canvas requires three essential elements; Linen which is marketed as Cotton Duck:, acid free Japanese Lining paper and a Wheat starch solution containing an alkali buffer which when used together provide a stable acid free environment for mounting a poster.

Linen backing is first and foremost a preservation and stabilization technique. It preserves the integrity of old and valuable paper and assures the poster can be safely handled and displayed.
