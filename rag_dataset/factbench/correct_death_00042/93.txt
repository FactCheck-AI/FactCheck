South Gate, Tomb of Akbar

Sikandra, Uttar Pradesh

Akbar's mausoleum was designed by the emperor, and modified by his son Jahangir after Akbar's death in 1605. It exhibits the transition in Mughal style from 16th century sandstone to 17th century white marble.

The minaretted South Gate, shown here, is the main entrance to the complex. Its placement conceals the view of the mausoleum behind it, a feature also found at the Taj Mahal. Other characteristic features include the bracketing of the large central arch by a smaller pair on either side, and the chamfering at the corners of the gate.

The tomb is located in Sikandra, 10 km northwest of Agra.
