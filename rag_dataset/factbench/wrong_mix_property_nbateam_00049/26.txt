Golden State Warrior and NBA Finals MVP Andre Iguodala married his childhood sweetheart, Christina Gutierrez, at One&Only Palmilla in Los Cabos, Mexico, on Saturday.

The couple was wed on the beach before guests including his teammates Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry, Shaun Livingston, Festus Ezeli and Draymond Green and Celtics star Evan Turner.

We’re told the bride wore Reem Acra and then Zuhair Murad for the wedding, planned by Marcy Blum.

The best man was their son Andre Jr. , who wore a tuxedo identical to his dad’s.
