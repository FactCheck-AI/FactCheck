After secretly separating in August 2011, HawthoRNe star Abigail Spencer has filed for divorce.

According to TMZ, the actress, 30, filed documents in L.A. County Superior Court, citing "irreconcilable differences." Spencer asked the court to grant soon-to-be ex-husband Andrew Pruett joint legal and physical custody of their 3-year-old son, Roman.

Spencer and Pruett married in 2004. The actress' other notable TV and film credits include This Means War (opposite Reese Witherspoon, Chris Pine, Tom Hardy and Chelsea Handler), Of Men and Mavericks (opposite Gerard Butler), Cowboys & Aliens (opposite Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde), Mad Men (opposite Jon Hamm, Elisabeth Moss and January Jones) and a two-year stint on All My Children.
