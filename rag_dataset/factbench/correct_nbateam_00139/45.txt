It has been four years since veteran big man Jason Maxiell last played in the NBA.

According to USA TODAY Sports, the 34- year-old has decided to retire from his professional basketball career on Friday by signing a one-day contract with the Detroit Pistonsâ€”where it all began for him.

The Detroit Pistons have signed Jason Maxiell to a contract, allowing him to retire as a member of the organization.

He spent the first years of his career with the Pistons after being selected with the 26th overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft. During his tenure, he averaged 6.1 points on 50.3 percent shooting from the field with 4.4 rebounds and 0.8 blocks in 19.1 minutes per game.

Jason Maxiell etched out a role as a reliable option off the bench for the Pistons and a fan favorite during his time with the team because of his hard-nosed style of play on the court. Following that, he played a season each for both the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets.
