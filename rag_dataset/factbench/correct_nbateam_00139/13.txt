The Detroit Pistons announced on Friday that forward Jason Maxiell will be retiring as a Piston.

General Manager Jeff Bower said in a statement "Jason and his representatives reached out to us regarding his desire to sign one last contract with the team in order to retire as a Detroit Piston. Jason made an impact on and off the court with the organization, spending eight seasons in Detroit, many with deep playoff runs. We're pleased that Jason has chosen to remain connected to our organization and wish him well in the future."

Maxiell was drafted in 2005 out of the University of Cincinnati and averaged 6.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, and 19.1 minutes in his 523 games with the organization.

With 426 blocks, he has ranked ninth all-time in franchise history.

"This is a special franchise with great tradition and history. I want to thank all the fans who supported me during my eight seasons representing Detroit" said Maxiell. "The best years of my life were spent in Detroit and it's important to me to retire as a Detroit Piston."
