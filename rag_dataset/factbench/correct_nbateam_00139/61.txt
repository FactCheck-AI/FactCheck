According to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports, the Orlando Magic have reached an agreement with Detroit Pistons free agent Jason Maxiell on a two-year, $5 million contract.

In his eight seasons with the Pistons, Maxiell registered 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds in 19 minutes per game. Last season, Maxiell averaged career highs in points (6.9), boards (5.7) and blocks (1.3) over 72 contests.

Maxiell, 6’7”, will join a frontcourt rotation that features Glen Davis, Nikola Vucevic, Maurice Harkless and Andrew Nicholson.

At 30 years old, Maxiell will be the second-oldest forward on the team’s roster behind Al Harrington.

The former Piston will bring a lot of experience to a young Magic roster.

The forward offers tough, tenacious defense. His defensive skills can significantly aid the Magic, who finished 25th in defensive efficiency in the NBA in 2012-13, per ESPN.com's Hollinger Team Statistics.

Bleacher Report's Jesse Dorsey ranked Maxiell as the third-biggest free-agent steal who remained available as of July 16.

The Pistons drafted Maxiell from the University of Cincinnati with the 26th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft. During his tenure with the Pistons, Maxiell was a part of a team that won the Central Division title from 2006-08.

The Magic finished last in the league last season with a record of 20-62. With the second overall pick in the 2013 NBA draft, they chose Victor Oladipo. The team will continue to rebuild with the addition of Maxiell.
