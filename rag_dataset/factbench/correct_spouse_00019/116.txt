It's so long ago now that many have forgotten, but Scarlett Johansson and Ryan Reynolds were married between 2008 and 2011.

Both have recognised that it was a very short marriage, but not many details have come out to explain what happened.

Now, though, during an appearance on Gwyneth Paltrow's Gloop Podcast, the actress has opened up about their brief relationship and how young she was back then.

Paltrow even joked that she had forgotten about that marriage, when interviewing Johansson.

What did Scarlett Johansson say about Ryan Reynolds on Gloop?

"Yes, we weren't married very long," she said.

"He's a good guy."

The actress then went on to speak about her current husband Colin Jost, who she has been married to since 2020.

She suggested that she is at a more mature stage of her life now and that this is the reason for this marriage working, but those to Reynolds and Romain Dauriac not.

"I didn't know what I wanted or needed from somebody else," she said.

"I never realized 'Oh, it's really important for me, I need to be with a compassionate person'.

"That's a fundamental characteristic that has to be there.

"I think that understanding what those fundamental things are that you need in a partner is a must, for longevity anyway.

"I think identifying those things was a game-changer for me."
