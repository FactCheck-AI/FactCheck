Scarlett Johansson got candid about how she feels about her first ex-husband, Ryan Reynolds, more than a decade after their divorce.

During an appearance on the Goop podcast this week, host Gwyneth Paltrow asked the Marriage Story actress how many times she had been married, to which she replied, “Three times.”

Paltrow, 50, responded, “Oh, that’s right because I forgot you were married to Ryan Reynolds. Goals.”

Johansson, who was married to the Deadpool actor from 2008 to 2010, noted they “weren’t married for very long”.

When Paltrow declared, “We love a good Ryan Reynolds in our house,” Johansson said, “He’s a good guy.”

Johansson, 38, and Reynolds, 46, announced their split in December 2010 following two years of marriage. They finalised their divorce the following July.

Though the duo rarely speaks publicly about their short-lived romance, Johansson briefly touched upon the subject in a 2019 Vanity Fair profile.

“I mean, the first time I got married I was 23 years old,” she said at the time.

“I didn’t really have an understanding of marriage. Maybe I kind of romanticised it, I think, in a way,” she went on.

Following their split, the Avengers actress wed journalist Romain Dauriac in 2014.

The exes, who called it quits in 2017, continue to co-parent their eight-year-old daughter, Rose.

Johansson then began dating Saturday Night Live funnyman Colin Jost in 2017, and the couple got engaged two years later.

They tied the knot in a private ceremony at the actress’ home in Palisades, New York, and welcomed their first child together, a son named Cosmo, in 2021.

Reynolds, for his part, began dating Gossip Girl star Blake Lively in 2011.

The following year, the pair tied the knot on a South Carolina plantation – which they later apologised for after backlash.

The Green Lantern co-stars share four children: James, 8, Inez, 6, Betty, 3, and a 2-month-old infant whose name has not been revealed to the public.
