The 49th Golden Horse Awards, also known as the Chinese-language Oscars, opened in Yilan County for the first time yesterday, drawing a crowd of fans of several big-time movies stars who lined up overnight to stand close to the star-studded red carpet.

Due to the limited seats in this year’s extravaganza, which took place at the county’s Luodong Cultural Working House, fans braved low temperatures in an effort to get a glimpse of their idols in glamorous outfits.

As of press time yesterday, Hong Kong singer and actor Ronald Cheng (鄭中基) had received the award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances in the Hong Kong comedy Vulgaria (低俗喜劇).

Chinese actress Liang Jing (梁靜) was crowned the Best Supporting Actress for her role in The Design of Death (殺生).

Taiwanese actor Shih Chun (石雋),77, bagged the honorary Lifetime Achievement Award for his long-time dedication to the entertainment industry.

Taiwanese director Chang Rong-Ji (張榮吉), 32, whose inspiring latest movie Touch of the Light (逆光飛翔), centered around a visually-impaired pianist, has garnered him widespread acclaim, was given the Best New Director Award.
