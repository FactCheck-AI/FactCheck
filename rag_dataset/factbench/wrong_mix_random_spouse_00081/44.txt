Hong Kong actor Ronald Cheng Chung-kei poses with the award for Best Supporting Actor for Vulgaria at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards ceremony in Hong Kong, China, 13 April 2013. Crime thriller Cold War triumphed at the Hong Kong Film Awards last night(13 April2013), winning in nine categories. Cold War won most of the big awards: best film; best director (for first-time directors Longman Leung and Sunny Luk Kim-ching); and best actor (Tony Leung Ka-fai). Alex Tsui Ka-kit, who was sensationally sacked by the ICAC 20 years ago, won best newcomer at the age of 65 for his role as a graft-buster in the film. Miriam Yeung Chin-wah had emotional reaction to her first best actress prize, for her performance in romantic comedy Love in the Buff. Laughing and crying at the same time, the singer-turned-actress said over and over: Why would this happen? Sex comedy Vulgaria took the best supporting actor and actress awards. A tearful Dada Chan, for whom this was her first awards nomination, said: I dont have dream. Like most Hongkongers, I work hard in silence until I find direction and my own value. Ronald Cheng Chung-kei, who won best supporting actor at Taiwans Golden Horse Awards for his part in the film, choked back tears, too, as he received the award from Yeung, his ex-girlfriend.
