In January of 1949, a maroon Hudson sedan pulled up to the house at 509 Wagner Street in Algiers, Louisiana. The driver was Neal Cassady, and the passengers included Jack Kerouac, Al Hinkle, and LuAnne Henderson. They drove nonstop from New York to visit William S. Burroughs, who had bought the house in August 1948 for $3500 and lived with his common-law wife Joan Vollmer, her six-year old daughter Julie, and the couple’s two-year old son Billy. Hinkle’s newlywed wife Helen was also staying there. The visit, which lasted a few days, would become renowned as an episode in Kerouac’s iconic Beat Generation novel On The Road (1957).
