One of the last links to the beat generation has been broken.

William S. Burroughs, author of Naked

Lunch and Junkie died Saturday at age 83 after

suffering a heart attack.

The son of a successful St. Louis businessman, Burroughs

graduated from Harvard University in 1938 and eventually made his

way to New York City where he befriended a circle of drifters and

students that included Allen Ginsberg, Jack

Kerouac and Neal Cassady. Burroughs,

first immortalized as Old Bull Lee in Kerouac’s On the

Road, moved to Texas with his wife, Joan, in 1946.

After accidentally shooting and killing his wife in a

drug-addled stage, Burroughs penned Junkie, then

disappeared to Tangier, Morocco where he wrote Naked

Lunch. Originally published in 1959, but banned in the United

States until 1962, Naked Lunch, with its offbeat monikers

and cut-up aesthetic, has since become a primary inspiration for

later literary and musical movements such as cyberpunk, punk rock

and hip-hop.

Burroughs bounced around for the next two decades, battling

heroin addiction and publishing sporadically. He briefly found a

home back in New York City during the punk era of the late ’70s. In

1981, Burroughs moved to Lawrence, Kan., where he lived out the

rest of his life.

By now a cultural icon, Burroughs appeared in a number of films,

including the award-winning Drugstore Cowboy and the big

screen version of Naked Lunch. He produced several

spoken-word albums, collaborated with popular musicians including

The Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and the late

Kurt Cobain.

Burroughs’ only son, William, died in 1981.
