Guglielmo Marconi sent the first wireless message over 100 years ago. Marconi became known for his work on long-distance radio transmission, and for his development of Marconi’s law and a radio telegraph system.

Marconi won the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics along with Karl Ferdinand Braun, in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy.

Guglielmo Marconi was born on 25th April 1874 in Bologna, Italy. In 1895, he succeeded in sending wireless signals over a distance of 2.4 kilometres.

In 1896, Marconi took his apparatus to England, and demonstrated his system successfully in London. He founded the Marconi Telegraph Company in 1899. He established wireless communication between France and England across the English Channel.

His experiment was significant, as it disproved the dominant belief of the Earth’s curvature affecting transmission. Marconi died on 20th July, 1937.
