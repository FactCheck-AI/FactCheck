Bjørnstjerne Martinius Bjørnson was a Norwegian writer who received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Literature .

“A Happy Boy” was written in 1859 , and is supposed to be Bjørnson’s best story of peasant life. In it the author has succeeded in drawing the characters with remarkable distinctness, while his profound psychological insight, his perfectly artless simplicity of style, and his thorough sympathy with the hero and his surroundings are nowhere more apparent.

This view is sustained by the great popularity of “A Happy Boy” throughout Scandinavia.
