King Henry I arranged the marriage between his nephew, Stephen of Blois and Matilda, the daughter and heiress of Eustace III, the Count of Boulogne. This gave Stephen control of the county of Boulgine and also lands in England that had belonged to Count Eustace II. Matilda was descended from both Malcolm III of Scotland and Edmund Ironside. ยน
