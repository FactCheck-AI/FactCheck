BIOGRAPHY

Columba Domínguez was a crucial figure in the golden age of Mexican cinema and considered one of its emblematic jewels. In 1948, Emilio Fernández gave her the antagonistic role of María Félix in the film Maclovia (1948), a performance that led her to win the Ariel award for best female co-acting. It is also thanks to this film that Fernández entrusts her with the leading role in what would become her best film: Pueblerina (1948), opposite Roberto Cañedo. Thanks to this film, Columba quickly rises to stardom and becomes known throughout the world. Columba separated from Fernández in 1952, which allowed him to establish himself as a leading figure and work under the orders of other directors such as Luis Buñuel in The River and Death (1955), Fernando Méndez in Ladrón de cadascas (1957) and Ismael Rodríguez in The Iron Brothers (1961) and Animas Trujano (1962). In 1962 she participated in The Miracle Weaver , a film that represented Latin America at the IX Berlin International Film Festival. Columba also made the first official nude in Mexican Cinema in the film La Virtue Naked (1956). After the actress retired in 1987, she dedicated herself to dance, humanistic subjects, painting (even exhibiting in Europe) and piano, in addition to practicing fencing and horse riding.
