What goes on in the shadows of science and its history?

For decades, Mileva Maric-Einstein’s story, the first wife of Albert Einstein, was hidden from view.

Then a cache of their early love letters was discovered in a family bank vault.

Their words to each other have sparked speculation and heated debate over Mileva’s role in Albert Einstein’s early scientific work and Nobel-winning theories, including the paradigm-shattering special theory of relativity.

But now a new investigation tests the evidence again.

‘For’ and ‘against’ go head to head as Science Friction charts the incredible story of Mileva and Albert over two episodes. In this episode, dig into the detail of the evidence.

Hear Part 1 of this series here - a meeting of minds and a love affair sowed fertile ground for Mileva and Albert's mutual love of physics.
