While just about everyone has heard of Albert Einstein, very few are aware of the scientific contributions of his first wife, Mileva Marić Einstein. A trained physicist like him, Mileva, despite being highly talented, was denied a degree and could not work as a physicist.

She collaborated with Albert Einstein during his most productive years. Find out more about this extraordinary physicist in my book or through the various ressources listed below.
