Czech Republic/Switzerland: 'Good King Wenceslas'. Miniature painting from the Codex Manesse, c. 1304-1340. Wenceslaus II/Vaclav II of Bohemia (27 September 1271 - 21 June 1305), was the King of Bohemia (1278-1305) and Poland (1300-1305), and Duke of Cracow (1291-1305). The only son of King Ottokar II and a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, he was married to Judith of Habsburg, daughter of Rudolf I, King of the Romans.
