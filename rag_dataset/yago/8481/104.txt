FILM

Obchod na Korze, directed by Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos. 1965. New York, NY: Criterion Collection, 2001.

In Jan Kadar and Elmar Klos’ 1965 film, Obchod na Korze (Shop on Main Street), Tóno Brtko, the main protagonist walks a fine line between indifference, collaboration and resistance in a Slovak town under Nazi occupation. Though not bound by any particular place name or historical event, the story invokes the memory of a problematic era for Slovakians and Europeans in general, when conscience and moral outrage competed with fear, hate and greed in directing individual actions.

Tóno’s inner qualms help him to overcome his fear and mitigate the financial loss of Mrs. Lautmanova, his intended victim. Though his humdrum existence as a poor carpenter is made sorrier by a nagging wife, Tóno takes the high road and refuses to participate in the building of the “Tower of Babel.” Furthermore, he refuses to be impressed by his collaborationist brother-in-law’s relative prosperity and only reluctantly consumes the sumptuous feast that the latter brings. Partly motivated by the chance of quick riches and edged on by his greedy wife, he agrees to become the “Aryan” manager of Mrs. Lautmanova’s store. Nevertheless, he helps her out by repairing her furniture even as he puts on a show of authority before his wife.
