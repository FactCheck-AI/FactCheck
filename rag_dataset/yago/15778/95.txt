Warner Bros. acquired the rights to make a Minecraft film back in 2014, and last year the film was delayed after Rob McElhenney, who was set to direct, left the project. Steve Carell was also in talks to star in the film but, according to Variety, scheduling issues arose, and he departed the project as well.
