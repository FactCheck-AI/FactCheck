Part of the answer to this mystery might come from Catherineâ€™s early life.

Catherine was originally named Sophia Augusta Frederica when was born in 1729 as a German princess.

In 1745, she married Karl Peter Ulrich, the future Peter III of Russia. Catherine was just 16 years old, and Peter was 17.

It quickly became clear to court observers that she was incredibly intelligent and ambitious.

This is evident in how quickly she mastered the Russian language and her willingness to convert to the Orthodox faith.

These acts helped her gain popularity among the Russian nobility, military, and even the common people.

In comparison, Peter was seen by many as too immature, eccentric, and more interested in military toys than in state affairs.

Their personalities and interests clashed, leading to a cold and distant marriage.

Over time, the couple's unhappiness led them to seek companionship and affection elsewhere. Both were involved in extramarital affairs.

Catherine formed relationships with several influential men, including Grigory Orlov, who would play a significant role in her rise to power.

On the other hand, Peter's infidelity and his admiration for Frederick II of Prussia further alienated him from Catherine and the Russian court.

Peter ascended the throne on December 25, 1762, but his reign was short-lived.

During this brief period, he managed to alienate the Orthodox Church and the military with his attempts at reforms.

He inherited a complex political landscape and a kingdom embroiled in the Seven Years' War.

His admiration for Prussian King Frederick II influenced his decision to withdraw Russian forces from the war, a move that shocked and angered the Russian military and nobility.

These reforms, while potentially progressive, were implemented hastily and without consideration for the existing social and political structures.

As a result, Peter faced increasing resistance from various sectors of Russian society.

His eccentric behavior and apparent disregard for Russian customs further estranged him from the court and the people.

Also, his pro-Prussian policies were deeply unpopular. Catherine, on the other hand, continued to proactively cultivate support among the Russian elite.

Then, in July 1762, just six months after Peter's ascension, Catherine led a coup against her husband.

On the day of the coup, Catherine left the Peterhof Palace and traveled to the barracks of the Ismailovsky Regiment in St. Petersburg.

There, she secured the loyalty of the soldiers by appealing to their discontent with Peter's reforms.

With the military on her side, she then proceeded to the Winter Palace, where she was proclaimed Empress of Russia.

The most popular theory suggests that Catherine the Great purposefully orchestrated the murder of her husband to secure her position as Empress.

This is supported by the fact that Catherine had a motive and the means to carry out such an act.

However, to date, there is no definitive evidence linking her to the crime. Catherine, along with her close allies, planned and executed Peter's murder.

It is speculated that she employed trusted individuals to carry out the act, ensuring that it would be seen as a natural death or an unfortunate accident.

In this scenario, Catherine's involvement would have been carefully concealed to protect her reputation and legitimacy as ruler.

Ultimately, the lack of conclusive evidence has led to a continued debate over the circumstances surrounding Peter's demise.

The mystery is compounded by the fact that no autopsy was conducted, and the body was quickly buried without a thorough investigation.

As a result, the true cause of Peter's death remains one of the most enduring mysteries in Russian history.
