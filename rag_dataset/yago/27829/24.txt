Catherine II (2 May 1729 - 17 November 1796) (Old Style Date: 21 April 1729 - 6 November 1796) most commonly known as Catherine the Great was the last Empress of Russia (1762 to 1796) and the longest-ruling. She came to power following the overthrow of her husband and second cousin, Peter III. Under her long reign, inspired by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, Russia experienced a renaissance of culture and sciences, which led to many new cities, universities, and theatres being founded; along with large-scale immigration from the rest of Europe, and the recognition of Russia as one of the great powers of Europe.
