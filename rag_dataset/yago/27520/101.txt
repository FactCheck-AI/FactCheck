Media mogul Rupert Murdoch has married Elena Zhukova at his Californian vineyard.

The wedding was held at Murdoch's estate Moraga on June 1, according to reports in the Murdoch family's Australian, UK and US media outlets.

The nuptials come just months after Mr Murdoch stepped down as chairman of Fox and News Corp, ending a more than seven-decade career at the helm of a sprawling media empire.

Ms Zhukova, 67, who emigrated from Moscow to the US in 1991, is a retired molecular biologist.

The pair began dating last northern summer and are said to have met through Mr Murdoch's third wife, Wendi Deng.

Mr Murdoch's most recent marriage, to actress and model Jerry Hall, ended in divorce in 2022 after six years.

He was briefly engaged last year to former San Francisco police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith, though the pair called off the engagement weeks later.

Moraga is the same place where Mr Murdoch and Walt Disney chief executive Bob Iger first discussed Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, a $US71 billion deal that closed in 2019.
