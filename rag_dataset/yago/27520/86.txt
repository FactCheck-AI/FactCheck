Rupert Murdoch has married for the fifth time at the age of 93.

The media mogul tied the knot with Elena Zhukova, a 67-year-old retired molecular biologist, at a wedding at Moraga, his vineyard and estate in California.

Ms Zhukova, from Moscow, wore a white dress while Mr Murdoch wore a dark suit and patterned yellow tie.

The couple met at a family gathering last year.

The former 21st Century Fox and News Corp chairman called off an engagement to former San Francisco police chaplain Ann Lesley Smith last year.

Mr Murdoch divorced his fourth wife Jerry Hall in August 2022.

He was previously married to entrepreneur Wendi Deng, whom he divorced in 2014 after 14 years of marriage. They have two daughters together.

Mr Murdoch split from his second wife Anna Murdoch Mann, a Scottish journalist with whom he had three children, in 1999.

He also had a daughter with his first wife Patricia Booker, who was a former flight attendant. They divorced in 1966.
