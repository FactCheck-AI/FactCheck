520|a 4K Restoration. Cult icon Serge Gainsbourg wrote, directed, and scored this tale of doomed love between a lonely truck stop waitress (Jane Birkin) and a gay, hunky garbage truck driver (Joe Dallesandro), whose boyfriend (Hugues Quester) becomes increasingly jealous of the two. Sharing the title with Gainsbourg and Birkin's sexually-explicit 1969 hit pop song, JE T'AIME MOI NON PLUS is an equally provocative depiction of sexual gratification told through an unlikely couple.
