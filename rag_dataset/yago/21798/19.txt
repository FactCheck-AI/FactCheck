NEW 4K RESTORATION

Cult icon Serge Gainsbourg wrote, directed, and scored this tale of doomed love between a lonely truck stop waitress (Jane Birkin) and a gay, hunky garbage truck driver (Joe Dallesandro), whose boyfriend (Hugues Quester) becomes increasingly jealous of the two. Sharing the title with Gainsbourg and Birkin’s sexually-explicit 1969 hit pop song, JE T’AIME, MOI NON PLUS is an equally provocative depiction of sexual gratification told through the story of an unlikely couple.

In French with English subtitles.
