Dmitri Pavlovich with Natalia Sergeevna Brasova, wife of Mikhail Alexandrovich.

[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich] must have been in his twenties then, and was most extraordinarily good-looking; very tall, very slender with the usual Romanov wasp waist and very long legs. I […] fell madly in love with him. Tania and Marina, of course, followed my example, and we had a secret Dmitri Club. This consisted of buying as many picture postcards of him as our pocket-money would allow, and trying to find out where he was or what he was doing by listening hard to what the grown-ups were saying. […] I started to write a diary all about Dmitri and in the innocence of my heart I hid it in my bed under the mattress. Of course, the next time that was turned my note-book was discovered and I came in for a lot of chaffing. I think it was very mean of whomever found it to take it straight to Mamma, she was of a caustic tongue and would not let me forget for weeks. The next time Dmitri came to the house I was almost imbecile with shyness and could, with pleasure, have fallen through the earth when Mamma said to him; ‘You know, Dmitri, this child is madly in love with you.’” From “Step-Daughter of Imperial Russia” by Nathalie Majolier (Natalia Sergeevna Mamontova), Mikhail Alexandrovich’s step-daughter.
