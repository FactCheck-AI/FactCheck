Kenneth Branagh and his cast join us for a very, very special lookback at In The Bleak Midwinter…

In 1995, Kenneth Branagh – between the giant projects of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and his film version of Hamlet – made an utterly charming low budget comedy called In The Bleak Midwinter. He paid for the film himself, bringing together a bunch of actors to tell the story of, well, a bunch of actors. A company who happened to be putting on a Christmas Eve performance of Hamlet.

In December 2023, after years of trying, we managed to bring them all together for a special screening of the film. And what you’re going to hear in this podcast episode is the conversation afterwards. Bear in mind that they’d all sat and watched the film collectively for the first time in over 25 years just before this conversation took place!

The evening was raising funds for Centrepoint, of which you can find more here.
