Even by Hollywood standards, Gloria Stuart has led a remarkable life. She became internationally famous with her award-winning portrayal of 101-year-old Rose in Titanic, but her acting career began in the 1930s. A famous beauty, she was featured in forty-six films. But movies weren't the sum total of her life. She was a political activist who was one of the founders of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi Committee and, in 1933, of the Screen Actors Guild. Her husband, Arthur Sheekman, had a long career writing comedy and drama for the screen, beginning with several Marx Brothers' classics. Gloria and Arthur enjoyed a busy social life -- sailing with Humphrey Bogart, entertaining Dorothy Parker and Robert at Christmas dinner, talking about food and books with M. F. K. Fisher. Groucho Marx was Arthur's best friend.Gloria's story of almost ninety years of loves, losses, and triumphs includes wonderful accounts of her life in Hollywood film. New York theater, and worldwide travels. Brilliant, irreverent, and witty, Gloria -- and Gloria -- are truly one of a kind.
