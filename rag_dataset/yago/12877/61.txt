A lot has been written about Rakesh Omprakash Mehra’s film, Fanney Khan, which features Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Anil Kapoor. The film is said to be a remake of Everybody’s Famous which was directed in English and Dutch by Dominique Deruddere.

There was a lot of buzz about who would be cast opposite Aishwarya. It was reported that Rajkummar Rao and Vicky Kaushal were considered for the role. However, finally, Madhavan has reportedly been signed on for the lead.
