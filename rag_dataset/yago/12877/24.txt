Savage Film‘s Bart Van Langendonck, the Flemish producer of Belgium’s foreign-language Oscar candidate “The Ardennes,” is partnering up with Unanimous Entertainment’s Chris Coen to co-produce “The Chapel,” a drama to be directed by “Everybody’s Famous”‘s helmer Dominique Deruddere.

The English-language project is set against the backdrop of the Queen Elisabeth Competition, a prestigious Brussels-set contest for classical musicians who are starting their careers.

Pic chronicles the journey of Jennifer Rogan, a young virtuoso pianist who prepares for the Queen Elisabeth Competition over the course of seven days, living in isolation along with 12 finalists in a chapel.

One of Belgium’s best-known directors, Deruddere’s credits include “Everybody’s Famous,” nominated for a foreign-language Oscar in 2001, and “Flying Love” with Jamie Dornan.

Following “The Ardennes,” which marked Robin Pront’s feature debut, Bart Van Langendonck (pictured above) is continuing to keep track of emerging helmers. Van Langendonck is indeed set to produce “The Checkpoint,” the directorial debut of Marnix Ruben, known for his critically-aclaimed shortfilm ‘De Overkant’ (’Across’).

“The Checkpoint” turns on Meddie, a honest local bar owner in a small Dutch town who agrees to open a legal coffeeshop upon request of the local authorities and ends up being accused of running a criminal organization by the government.

Van Langendonck described “The Checkpoint” as being in the vein “Wolf of Wall Street.”

Van Langendonck’s slate also includes Roskam’s “The Racer and the Jailbird” which will star Adèle Exarchopoulos and Matthias Schoenaerts. Pierre-Ange Le Pogam’s Stone Angels is producing with Savage Film. The Flemish outfit previously produced Roskam’s Oscar-nominated “Bullhead.”
