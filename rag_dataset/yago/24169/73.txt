This summary provides the key details about Cornel West's book "Race Matters" in 3 sentences: Cornel West examines the systemic racism and white supremacy ingrained in American society that inflicts "ontological wounds and emotional scars" on Black Americans. He argues that the loss of effective Black cultural, religious, and civic institutions combined with the influence of the media and consumerism have led to a decline in values and meaning for Black communities. West calls for a new ethical framework centered around acknowledging the humanity in all people in order to address the racial inequalities and moral failings of American society.
