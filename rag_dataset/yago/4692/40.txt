Biography

Gloria Stuart is Notable.

Gloria Stuart was a centenarian, living to age 100.

Gloria Stewart was "an American actress, visual artist, and activist. She was initially known for her roles as a contract player in the 1930s and 1940s, though she would garner widespread fame later in life for her critically acclaimed role in James Cameron's Titanic (1997). Her accolades include a Screen Actors Guild Award, one Academy Award nomination, and one Golden Globe nomination." She also became an accomplished artist as a painter and sculptor.[1]

Gloria was born 4 July 1910 in Santa Monica, California, the daughter of Frank Stewart and Alice Vaughn Diedrick. (Gloria later changed the spelling of her last name.) When she was 9 years old, her father was fatally injured when hit by a car. She hadn't been given a middle name at birth, so sometimes she adopted one. She often used Frances, the feminine name of her father Frank.

She attended the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in drama and philosophy, but dropped out her junior year to marry her first husband.

She was married twice. Her first husband was the sculptor Blair Gordon Newell, whom she married 21 June 1930 in Los Angeles.[2] The were divorced four years later. "Gloria Stuart, film star and former University of California co-ed, announced the trial separation she and her husband, Blair Gordon Newell, sculptor, began ten months ago would end in divorce. Her suit will charge incompatibility, she said. They met while they were students at Berkeley and were married June 21, 1930."[3]

Her second husband was screenwriter Arthur Sheekman, whom she married 28 July 1934 in Ague, Mexico. "Gloria Stuart Weds in Mexico: The film star, formerly the wife of Gordon Newell, sculptor, and her husband, Arthur Sheekman, scenario writer, whom she married recently in Agua Caliente, at the studio in Hollywood where she is appearing in a picture." (See photo at bottom right.)[4] They were married until his death in 1978.

She returned to acting in the mid-1970s, appearing on television. In the late 1990s, director James Cameron cast her in the multi-million-dollar epic "Titanic," for which she was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award, a Golden Globe, and an Oscar nomination.

Gloria was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1984. She had surgery and radiation to treat it, and it did not return. Twenty years later, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. She had radiation, but slowly over time the cancer returned, and the malignancy spread. She lived six years after her diagnosis.

On the day of Gloria's 100th birthday, Titanic directer James Cameron and his wife Suzy hosted her birthday party at the ACE Art Gallery in Beverly Hills. Gloria saw many of her paintings and works there.

Sadly, 12 weeks later, Gloria passed away on 26 September 2010 in Beverly Hills at the age of 100.[5] She had four grandchildren, and twelve great grandchildren.
