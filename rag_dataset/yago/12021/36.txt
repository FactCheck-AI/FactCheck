The season kicks off with a bit of brilliant symbolism by having Marlo’s lieutenants Chris Partlow (Gbenga Akinnagbe) and Felicia “Snoop” Pearson (Felicia Pearson) continuing a killing spree, and hiding the bodies in the vacant buildings. A ghost town may as well have dead residents. The lack of corpses allows Marlo to rise to power even though he only seems to have Chris and Snoop as his muscle (more on that later). Of course, it doesn’t hurt that the Major Crimes Unit is trying to follow the money and root out political corruption, and homicide can’t investigate crimes they don’t see, and frankly, aren’t trying too hard to find. Bunk (Wendell Pierce) believes a missing corner kid, Lex, has been murdered, but with no body, there’s no case. Despite the rising body count, life on the street is relatively quiet. Daniels (Lance Reddick) now runs the Western District, he’s in a happy relationship with Ronnie (Deirdra Lovejoy), Herc is working protection for Mayor Royce (Glynn Turman), and Lester (Clarke Peters) and Greggs (Sonja Sohn) are happily working their case with no interference from their new commander, who’s too busy working on his summer home to care what his unit is up to. Most surprising is a happy Jimmy McNulty (Dominic West), who has stopped being a surly drunk and now enjoys domesticated bliss with Beadie Russell (Amy Ryan). Of course, a happy McNulty isn’t necessarily and interesting McNulty, and the show makes the bold move of marginalizing one of its most popular characters. But the heart of the new season is the new characters Duquan “Dukie” Weems (Jermaine Crawford), Randy Wagstaff (Maestro Harrell), Namond Brice (Julito McCullum), and Michael Lee (Tristan Wilds).
