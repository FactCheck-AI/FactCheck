Dean “Deaner” Murdock (Paul J. Spence), the Canadian star of FUBAR: BALLS TO THE WALL has been denied entry into the US for SXSW, where the film is having its stateside premiere Monday at 9:30 pm. He is one half of the head-banging duo profiled in the film. The other half, Terry Cahill (David Lawrence) was allowed to cross the border. Murdock says, “I aint gonna take this personally; the f@#kin’ border guy who searched me was just doin’ his job, but f@#k why did he have to have such thick fingers? Giv’r to yer liv’r in my honor tonight, and fer f@#k’s sakes, wash yer denim before you cross the border.”

Cahill says, “It will be a total bummer partying without Dean here but sometimes when it comes to laws, you gotta do the right thing. Maybe I can find a Deaner dopple-banger in Austin who can hit those high notes.” Cahill plans to post an official video response on his twitter account later today. The trailer is below.
