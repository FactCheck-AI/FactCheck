Profession: Noblewoman

Biography: Hortense de Beauharnais was a French noblewoman, best known as the Queen Consort of Holland and the mother of Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.

Hortense was the daughter of Alexandre, Vicomte de Beauharnais, and Jos√©phine Beauharnais. Her life was deeply entwined with the rise and fall of the Napoleonic Empire. Following her father's execution during the Reign of Terror, and her mother's imprisonment and subsequent release, Hortense's mother married Napoleon Bonaparte, who would later become the Emperor of France.

As a member of the imperial family, Hortense was educated at Madame Campan's boarding school at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, where she became known for her musical talent and beauty. In 1802, as part of a political arrangement, she was married to Louis Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother. The union was unhappy, but it produced three sons: Napoleon Charles, Napoleon Louis, and Charles Louis Napoleon, the latter of whom became Napoleon III.

Louis Bonaparte was made King of Holland by Napoleon in 1806, which made Hortense the Queen Consort of Holland. Her time in this role was marked by personal and political difficulties, and she spent much of it in France. Despite her royal status, Hortense's relationship with her husband remained strained, and they separated after the death of their eldest son.

After Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France, Hortense's life was filled with political intrigue and exile. She was initially granted the Duchy of Saint-Leu by Louis XVIII, but as the political climate turned against Bonapartists, she fled to Switzerland and later to Italy.

Hortense was an accomplished musician and composer, and her salon was a center of artistic and intellectual life during her time. She also played a significant role in the political aspirations of her son, Louis Napoleon, supporting his ambitions which eventually led to him becoming Emperor of the French in 1852.
