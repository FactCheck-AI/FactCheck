Individual Note

Infanta Urraca of Portugal (1151  16 October 1188) was a Portuguese infanta (princess), daughter of Afonso I, 1st King of Portugal and his wife Maud of Savoy.

Urraca was born at Coimbra. She married Ferdinand II of León (c. 1165) with whom she had Alfonso IX of León. This marriage failed to prevent her father Afonso I from declaring war on Ferdinand after he became his son-in-law. This short war culminated in disaster when Afonso was captured in Badajoz. Perhaps due to his marriage to Urraca, Ferdinand was generous to Afonso, and let him leave. However, the marriage of Ferdinand II and Urraca was annulled in 1175 by the Pope, the two being second cousins, great-grandchildren of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. That this was political in nature is shown by Ferdinand's remarriage to Teresa Fernández de Traba, the half-aunt of Urraca and thus a generation closer to Alfonso VI.

After the dissolution of her marriage, Urraca returned to the court of her father at Valladolid, and died there, aged only 37, nine months after the death of her former husband.
