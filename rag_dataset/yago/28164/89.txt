Fifty-five years ago today, Don Juan Carlos of Spain married Princess Sophia of Greece and Denmark in Athens. The Greek princess (who changed the spelling of her name to the Spanish Sofia) wore a family heirloom, the Prussian Tiara, to wed the future Spanish king in two ceremonies (one Roman Catholic, one Greek Orthodox). Hereâ€™s a look at snippets from their wedding day!
