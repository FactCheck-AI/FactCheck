PRAGUE, Jan. 27 -- The office of the Czech Presidency announced Saturday the death of Olga Havlova, the 62-year-old wife of Czech President Vaclav Havel who had fought cancer for over a year. Speaking on Czech radio, Premier Vaclav Klaus praised Havlova's character and dignity and offered his condolences to Havel.

Havlova's medical problems began in the fall of 1993 and she underwent surgery and an extended series of tests last year. But her condition deteriorated rapidly after the New Year and doctors were unable to prevent the spread of cancer to most of her vital organs. Havlova was the subject of 'Letters to Olga,' Havel's intensely personal collection of letters which he wrote from prison under the Communist regime. As the Czech first lady, Havlova was admired for her work with the mentally and physically handicapped. Klaus said he had the deepest respect for Havlova. 'I trust the president will be able to recover from this hard blow,' he said on Czech radio. A private funeral will be held near Prague Castle on Feb. 2.
