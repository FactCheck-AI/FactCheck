Caroline married Joachim Murat, one of

Napoleon’s generals. Napoleon made them King

and Queen of Naples after he moved his eldest

brother Joseph from Naples to Spain. During

Napoleon’s exile on Elba, Murat initially formed

an alliance with the Austrians to keep the throne.

He rallied again to Napoleon during the Hundred

Days which resulted in his execution. Caroline then called herself the “Countess of Lipona” (anagram of Napoli).
