Tina Fey and Steve Carell are to star in a new Netflix comedy called The Four Seasons.

It is based on the 1981 film of the same name, written and directed by M*A*S*H’s Alan Alda. The movie revolved around three couples who holiday together, and how their dynamic changed when one of the husbands left his wife for a younger woman.

Fey – who previously starred alongside Carell in the 2010 action romcom Date Night (pictured above) – has created and written the series with former 30 Rock colleagues Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield.

Further casting for The Four Seasons – which will be Carell's first show for Netflix since his comedy Space Force was axed in 2022 – are yet to be announced.

The Four Seasons previously spawned a short-lived CBS series in 1984, produced by Alda, who is one of the executives on the new project, too.
