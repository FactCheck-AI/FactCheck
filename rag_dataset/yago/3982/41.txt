Just 23 years old when she created it, Lotte Reiniger’s The Adventures of Prince Achmed premiered in Germany in 1926, whereupon it was immediately hailed as the world’s first feature-length animated film. Today, this enchanting Arabian Nights tale remains one of the great classics of animation—beautiful, mesmerizing, and packed with imaginative and wondrous adventures, including a magical flying horse, a sorcerer’s army of monsters, and, of course, a beautiful princess.

This cinematic treasure for all ages has been restored to reproduce its delicate images and spectacular color tinting and will be presented with live musical accompaniment by pianist David Drazin. (65 minutes)

“There’s never been anything like it. Dazzling and utterly sophisticated.” -Peter Stack, San Francisco Chronicle
