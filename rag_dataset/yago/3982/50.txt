Please join us on Thursday, August 29th at 7:30 PM for a screening of Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed (The Adventures of Prince Achmed) This 1926 film was created by Lotte Reiniger, a pioneer of silhouette animation.

On the day when in the city the birthday celebrations for the great caliph are being held, the powerful sorcerer appears and presents the marvel he has created: a horse that can fly through the skies. The caliph would like to have this magic horse by all means, but in exchange he is to give his charming daughter Dinarsade to the ugly sorcerer to be his wife. This angers Dinarsade’s brother Ahmed, and he chases the intruder away. The sorcerer, however, finds a way of luring the prince onto the fateful horse. Thus begins Achmed’s adventurous journey. While the sorcerer is put in chains, the horse with the horrified prince on its back rises in the air, into the starry sky. Finally, the prince discovers the lever that propels the horse downwards, and they land on the island of Wak Wak. The island is the home of the beautiful Pari Banu, ruler of Wak Wak, whom Prince Achmed immediately falls in love with and carries off to distant lands on his magic horse.
