LOS ANGELES >> Court records show Kris and Bruce Jenner have finalized their divorce, but they won’t be officially single until March.

A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday signed off on the couple’s divorce judgment that ends the pair’s 23-year marriage.

The Jenners filed divorce petitions in September, citing irreconcilable differences. California law requires couples to wait six months to become officially divorced.

Bruce Jenner won a gold medal in the men’s decathlon in the 1976 Olympics, although he is best known to a younger generation as Kim Kardashian’s stepfather. He and ex-wife Kris frequently appeared on the reality series “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” along with their children.

The divorce judgment calls for Kris Jenner to pay her estranged husband $2.5 million.

Kris and Bruce Jenner married in April 1991 and have two daughters together.
