DANIEL GERROLL is Dr. Glas in Jeffrey Hatcher's adaptation of the classic Swedish novel by Hjalmar Soderberg. When you read this psychological thriller with its dashes of philosophical musings woven into intricate and intimate journal entries, Dr. Glas stays deeply embedded in the imagination. An aloof Swedish physician who gradually unburdens his soul with the story of his obsession for another man's wife and the murder he plots to win her heart.

Published in 1905 in Swedish it wasn't until 1963 that there was an available English translation. In 1942 it was adapted for a film in black and white by Rune Carlsten and in 1968 Mai Zetterling directed a Danish version in color. Various stage adaptations have appeared all over Northern Europe but this adaptation by Jeffrey Hatcher, performed by Daniel Gerroll, is the first serious American version.
