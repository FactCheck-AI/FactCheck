In a stunning bit of matrimony gossip, News Corp. overlord Rupert Murduch has filed for divorce from his pie bodyguard/third wife, Wendi Deng. Deadline Hollywood got the scoop that divorce papers were filed this morning in New York State, and a spokesperson for News Corp confirms the story.

Murdoch and Deng, who are separated in age by 38 years, were married in 1999 and have two children together. These two profiles of Deng — one from 2000 and one from last year — chart the ever-changing public attitudes toward their relationship; her various portrayals as both a "gold digger" and an aspiring media mogul herself; and her role in shaping the latter part of her husband's career.
