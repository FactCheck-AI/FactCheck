Did You Know?[]

Agrippina the Elder was a distinguished and prominent Roman member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of the first century. She was the wife of the general and statesman Germanicus and a relative to the first Roman Emperors.

She was quite the woman - the second granddaughter of Emperor Augustus, sister-in-law, stepdaughter and daughter-in-law of Emperor Tiberius (must get awkward at family reunions), mother of Emperor Caligula, maternal second cousin and sister-in-law of Emperor Claudius and the maternal grandmother of Emperor Nero.

Her life was complicated and dramatic, to say the least. She accompanied her husband Germanicus to Germany and to the East, where he died at Antioch in AD 19. On her return, she was livid and accused Tiberius of having had Germanicus murdered, and relations between them remained extremely tense, as one can imagine if you have just accused someone of murder...

Sejanus, Tiberius’ chief minister, encouraged the Emperor’s suspicion of her for his own twisted purposes, especially when the death of Tiberius’ son Drusus in AD 23 brought her sons into direct line for the succession.

In AD 29 Agrippina was exiled, and her son Drusus was imprisoned the next year. In AD 33, two years after the fall of Sejanus, they both died in suspicious circumstances of starvation. Tiberius was suspected of having ordered their deaths.

Of her nine children by Germanicus, one son and three daughters survived her, the son becoming Tiberius’ successor as the emperor Gaius Caligula.
