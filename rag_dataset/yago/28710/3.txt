Did You Know?[]

Therese Charlotte Luise von Sachsen-Hildburghausen was on the shortlist in 1809 to become the bride of Napoleon Bonaparte, but instead she was matched with Crown Prince Ludwig I of Bavaria. At 18 years old, Therese was wed to the future king.

The festivities that followed their marriage in Munich on October 12th, 1810, went down as the very first Oktoberfest. While her new husband stated he could not wish for a better woman, he did make it known that he “married without passion as it’s more profitable for the future.” Charming.
