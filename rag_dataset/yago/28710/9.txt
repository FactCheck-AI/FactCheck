Celebrated across Germany this month, the annual Oktoberfest merriment owes its origins to a grand royal wedding of the 19th century. The young German bride was Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, who was once considered to be the intended for Napoleon I of France, but on 12 October 1810 she married Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig instead.

Ludwig’s father, Maximilian, had been appointed the first King of Bavaria thanks to his Napoleonic allegiances during the Revolutionary wars of the 18th century, so on the big day Therese was presented with a wedding gift deemed suitably impressive for a fledgling monarchy. She was bequeathed a staggering four-piece gold parure bejewelled with rubies, diamonds and spinels. The necklace, earrings and cuff style bracelets are eclipsed only by the colossal high-standing tiara, which is heavily set with diamonds in a floral motif with scattered rubies and two much larger central spinels.

When their wedding reception was held a week later just outside of Munich, the festivities were attended by 35,000 guests and members of the public, all celebrating the new royal couple. Such was its success that the event is still annually celebrated over 200 years later.
