Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro is a classic Indian movie from 1989 that tells the story of a young man named Salim, who lives in the Mumbai slums and struggles to survive in a world of poverty, violence, and crime. Salim is a Muslim by birth and belongs to a community of North Indian migrants who have settled in the city. He is a talented photographer and dreams of making it big as an artist, but his ambitions are constantly thwarted by the harsh realities of life.

One of the central themes of the movie is the tension between the Hindu and Muslim communities in Mumbai. Salim grows up in a world where violence against Muslims is commonplace, and he witnesses the brutality of the police and the injustice of the legal system. He is repeatedly harassed, beaten up, and arrested by the police, who treat him as a criminal simply because of his religion and his place of birth.

The movie is a powerful commentary on the social and political realities of India in the late 1980s. It portrays the harshness and injustice of life in the slums, as well as the deep-seated prejudices and biases that exist in Indian society. The movie is also a powerful critique of the political and economic systems that keep people like Salim trapped in a cycle of poverty and violence.

The performances in the movie are outstanding. Pawan Malhotra gives an unforgettable performance as Salim, capturing the nuances of his character's emotions and struggles with great sensitivity and nuance. Makrand Deshpande is equally impressive as the cynical and street-smart Raja, Salim's best friend and partner in crime. Ashutosh Gowariker, who would go on to become a successful filmmaker, is also excellent as the naive and idealistic Jamal, Salim's fellow photographer and love interest.

The cinematography is another highlight of the movie. The director, Saeed Akhtar Mirza, uses stark black-and-white visuals to portray the harsh realities of life in the Mumbai slums. The camera captures the busy streets, the crowded markets, and the dilapidated buildings with great realism and detail. The movie also makes use of aerial shots to show the sprawling expanse of the slums and the vastness of the city beyond.

Overall, Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro is a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. It is a movie that speaks to the struggles and aspirations of millions of people in India and around the world who live in impoverished and marginalized communities. It is a movie that reminds us of the power of art and storytelling to bring people together and inspire change.
