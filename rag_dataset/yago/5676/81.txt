SAMUEL AUGUSTUS BARNETT (FEBRUARY 8, 1844-JUNE 17, 1913)

Anglican Canon of Westminster, and Social Reformer

husband and partner of

HENRIETTA OCTAVIA WESTON ROWLAND BARNETT (MAY 4, 1851-JUNE 10, 1936)

Social Reformer

June 17 is the feast day of the Barnetts in The Church of England.

Even if The Church of England had not paired the Barnetts on a feast day, I would have decided to do so anyway. The couple was a team from the day they married in 1873 to the day Samuel Barnett died in 1913. I have established emphasizing relationships and influences as a goal for this, A Great Cloud of Witnesses: An Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days.

Samuel Augustus Barnett, born in Bristol, England, on February 8, 1844, was a son of Mary Gilmore and iron manufacturer Francis Barnett. Our saint, an 1867 graduate of Wadham College, Oxford, joined the ranks of Anglican clergymen that year and became the Curate of St. Mary’s, Bryanston Square, Marylebone, London. He married Henrietta Octavia Weston Rowland in 1873.

Henrietta, born in London, England, on May 4, 1851, was a socially conscious heiress. Her mother was Henrietta Monca Margaretta Didges. Our saint’s father was Alexander William Rowland (d. 1869), in the oil business. Her mother predeceased her father. Young Henrietta, altruistic from an early age, attended a boarding school in Devon. Starting in 1869 or so, she worked with Octavia Hill (1838-1912), active in efforts to improve slums in London.

The work in which the Barnetts engaged together, starting in 1873, flowed from their faith and their Christian Socialist ideals. Samuel served as the Vicar of St. Jude’s, Whitechapel, London, from 1873 to 1894. He led an congregation in a slum. He, the founder (1869) of the Charity Organization Society, worked with Henrietta in improving the lives of people in Whitechapel. The couple addressed housing. Substandard housing was a major problem. The Barnetts lobbied for building suitable residences. They also enriched slum dwellers’ lives with art; the couple founded the Whitechapel Art Gallery. Urban children needed countryside holidays. The Barnetts raised funds and arranged for those holidays. Entertainment was another need the Barnetts worked to provide. Education was, of course, vital. The Barnetts founded a night school for adults. Samuel also served on school committees. Through Toynbee Hall, of which Samuel was the first warden (1884-1906) and in which Henrietta taught, tutors from Oxford lived and taught in the slum. Jane Addams (1860-1935) and Ellen Gates Starr (1859-1940) modeled Hull House, Chicago, Illinois, on Toynbee Hall. Henrietta’s sister, Alice Marion Rowland Hart (1848-1931) also taught at Toynbee Hall.

The Barnetts wrote books together. These included:

Practicable Socialism: Essays on Social Reform (1888, 1894),

Religion and Progress (1907),

Towards Social Reform (1909),

Religion and Politics (1911),

Worship and Work (1913), and

Vision and Service (1917).

Samuel also wrote Perils of Wealth and Poverty, published posthumously in 1920.

Samuel, a Canon of Westminster (1906-1913), died in London on June 17, 1913. He was 69 years old.

Henrietta continued in good works until 1936. She founded Barnett House, Oxford, for the study of social sciences, in Samuel’s honor. She wrote Canon Barnett: His Life, Work, and Friends (1918)–Volumes I and II. She also wrote books on topics ranging from child rearing to working for economic justice. Our saint had formed the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust, which entailed building mixed-income housing, in 1903. Henrietta, form 1924 a Commander of the British Empire, took up painting during her final years. She, aged 85 years, died in London on June 10, 1936.

The Barnetts understood the Biblical mandate to help the less fortunate. They knew that those blessed with privilege have a responsibility to aide those not blessed in that way. Our saints accepted that the more one has, the more responsibilities one has. They acted accordingly, for the glory of God and the benefit of many people. They were faithful partners of God.

The poor will always be with us. That is a fact. Increasing numbers of the impoverished can, of course, cease to be poor. Poverty is a function of various factors, not the least of which is institutionalized artificial scarcity. Therefore, individual actions help alleviate the problem, but institutional revolution is necessary to make substantial dents in poverty. The ultimate solution to institutionalized artificial scarcity resides in the purview of God, whose partners we are supposed to be.

Feast of Mark Hopkins (June 17)

MARK HOPKINS (FEBRUARY 4, 1802-JUNE 17, 1887)

U.S. Congregationalist Minister, Theologian, Educator, and Physician

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ideal college is Mark Hopkins on one end of a log and a student on the other.

–James Abram Garfield (November 19, 1831-September 19, 1881), President of the United States of America (March 4-September 19, 1881)

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Mark Hopkins comes to this, A Great Cloud of Witnesses: An Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days, via G. Scott Cady and Christopher L. Webber, A Year with American Saints (2006).

Hopkins came from a devout Congregationalist family, which shaped his destiny. He, a son of Archibald Hopkins (1766-1839) and Mary Curtis Hopkins (1772-1868), debuted in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, on February 4, 1802. A great-uncle was Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803), a prominent Congregationalist minister, theologian, and abolitionist. Our saint, who graduated from Williams College, Williamstown, Massachusetts, in 1824, worked as a tutor at Williams College (1825-1827) prior to matriculating at Berkshire Medical College, Pittsfield, Massachusetts (Class of 1830). The our saint returned to Williams College as Professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy (1830-1887). He also served as the president of the college (1836-1872). Hopkins, a skilled practitioner of the Socratic Method, became an ordained minister in 1833. He chose to remain at Williams College; our saint declined a host of offers from churches, universities, colleges, and seminaries elsewhere. Hopkins also found time to serve as the President of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions from 1857 to 1887.

Hopkins married Mary Hubbell (1813-1898). The couple had ten children.

Hopkins produced a range of published works of theology. His theology anticipated Charles Darwin‘s On the Origin of Species (1859), which was unoriginal. (Ask Alfred Russel Wallace.) Our saint’s On the Argument from Nature for the Divine Existence (1833), rooted in Aristolelian philosophy and the theology of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1768), argued that evolution is a driving force within nature and is consistent with the existence of God.

Hopkins, Renaissance man and Christian apologist, died in Williamstown, Massachusetts, on June 17, 1887. He was 85 years old.

Hopkins, as an educator, intrigues me. I have much experience in postsecondary education. I have been around long enough to witness changes in the student body. Nothing is new under the sun, of course. However, I recognize that some negative patterns have become more prominent lately. Increasingly, students do not know how to take notes and/or do not want to take their own notes. No, more pupils expect their professors and instructors to give them notes, preferably in the form of overly verbose and poorly-designed PowerPoint slides. Attention spans have become shorter. Socrates did not need billboards and PowerPoint slides. Neither did Mark Hopkins. He had what he needed.

Feast of Jane Cross Bell Simpson (June 17)

Above: The Flag of Scotland

Image in the Public Domain

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

JANE CROSS BELL SIMPSON (NOVEMBER 21, 1811-JUNE 17, 1886)

Scottish Presbyterian Poet and Hymn Writer

Facts about the life of Jane Cross Bell Simpson are scarce. She seems to have been like most holy people in that regard, for she kept her personal life private.

Our saint was the daughter of James Bell, an attorney in Glasgow, Scotland. She, born on November 21, 1811, had an older brother, Henry Glassford Bell (1803-1874), an attorney, poet, historian, magazine editor, and defender of the late Mary, Queen of Scots. [Aside: One can find some of his books at archive.com.] Henry, as editor of The Edinburgh Literary Journal, published texts by his sister, who wrote as “Gertrude.” Our saint also contributed to The Scottish Christian Herald, a magazine of The Church of Scotland. At least two books edited by other people contained some her work. These were:

The Seaman’s Devotional Assistant (1830), and

Lyra Britannica: A Collection of British Hymns; Printed from the Genuine Texts; with Biographical Sketches of the Hymn Writers (first edition, 1867; second edition, 1868).

She also published books:

The Piety of Daily Life (1836),

April Hours (1838),

Women’s History (1848),

The Consumptive (1850),

Linda, or Beauty and Genius (1859),

Picture Poems (1879), and

Linda, and Other Poems (1879).

Our saint, who married cousin J. Bell Simpson of Glasgow in 1837, died at Aberdeen, Scotland, on June 17, 1886.

I have added one of Simpson’s texts, “Star of Peace to Wanderers Weary” (1830), to my GATHERED PRAYERS weblog. I have also located two other notable hymns, the first of which offers advice regarding prayer:

Go when the morning shineth,

Go when the noon is bright;

Go when the eve declineth,

Go in the hush of night;

Go with pure mind and feeling,

Fling earthly thought away,

And, in thy chamber kneeling,

Do thou in secret pray.

+++++

Remember all who love thee,

All who are loved by thee;

Pray, too, for those that hate thee,

If any such there be.

Then for thyself, in meekness,

A blessing humbly claim;

And link, with each petition,

The great Redeemer’s name.

+++++

Or if ’tis e’er denied thee

In solitude to pray,

Should holy thoughts come o’er thee,

When friends are round thy way;

Even then the silent breathing

Of thy spirit raised above,

May reach His throne of glory,

Who is mercy, truth, and love!

+++++

O! not a joy of blessing

With this can we compare,

The power that He hath given us

To pour our hearts in prayer!

Whene’er thou pin’st in sadness,

Before His footstool fall,

And remember, in thy gladness,

His grace who gave thee all.

Another text meditates on the death of children:

I had a lesson to teach them,

The children that God had given,

From a Book most high and holy,

Whose theme is the love of heaven.

+++++

But some of these baby-blossoms

Were laid by the reaper low,

Ere yet they could spell the lettres

I wish’d them so much to know.

+++++

And one, on whose soul had fallen

The lesson with deepest power,

Went home to the sainted glory

In the dawn of his manhood’s hour.

+++++

Ah! then, as the waves of sorrow

Went over my drooping head,

My pupils became my teachers,

The living was taught by the dead!

+++++

And the more their memory held me,

The children I ne’er could see;

The more we rehearsed that lesson

The children yet left with me.

+++++

And still, when the Book is opened

Where wisdom and peace are found,

We fancy our loved ones bending

To meet us on holy ground.

+++++

And the lesson so pure and tender,

We study with silent prayer,

Sinks down to our inmost spirits,

With these angels hovering there!

+++++

And we long to fold our pinions,

By sin and by sorrow press’d,

‘Neath the tree by the crystal river,

The city of endless rest.

+++++

Till then, with a real untiring,

We’ll con the lesson of love;

The children on earth yet dwelling,

And the children moored above.

The decline in the frequency of inclusion of texts by Simpson in hymnals since the early 1900s is quite unfortunate, given the high quality of her writing and the relatively poor quality of many recent texts hymnal committees have chosen to include in lieu of other options.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

EDITH FLORENCE BOYLE MACALISTER (JUNE 16, 1873-NOVEMBER 27, 1950)

English Novelist and Hymn Writer

Information about Edith Florence Boyle MacAlister is, in my experience, not plentiful. Yet what I have found is positive.

Our saint, born in 1873, wrote Uncle Hal (1910), a book for girls. Not only id she write juvenile fiction, but she served for a time as superintendent of the Primary Department of St. Columba’s Presbyterian Church, Cambridge, England (now St. Columba’s United Reformed Church).

In 1895 Edith married Donald MacAlister (1854-1934) who, from 1909 to 1929 served as Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow. He became Sir Donald MacAlister, Baronet of Tarbert, in 1924, and Chancellor of the University five years later. As if all this were not enough, he was also a linguist, a mathematician, and a medical doctor.

The Hymnal (1933), Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. contains a lovely text for the occasion of an infant baptism written by our saint and altered. Those verses read:

Father, hear us as we pray

For these little ones today:

Good and gentle may they be;

Ever loving Thee.

+++++

Fold them ‘neath the wings of love;

Write their names in heaven above:

Guard and keep them safe from harm;

Hold them with Thine arm.

Our saint died in 1950.

Today I add to my Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days three sisters, members of the royal house of Portugal. Theirs was a world different from ours. Theirs was a world of absolute monarchies, arranged marriages, and an Iberian peninsula divided among several kingdoms and between two religions. Shall we begin?

Sts. Teresa (1178-1250), Sanchia (1182-1229), and Mafalda (1204-1252) were daughters of King Sancho I of Portugal (reigned 1185-1211). Sancho’s son Alfonso II (reigned 1211-1223) succeeded to the throne immediately. The Kings of Castille and Leon were close relatives. So it was that Rome anulled the marriage of St. Teresa to her cousin, King Alfonso IX of Leon (reigned 1188-1230), and the union of St. Mafalda and her cousin, King Enrique I of Castille (reigned 1214-1217), on the grounds that everybody was too closely related. These were arranged marriages. And both Mafalda and Enrique were minors; she was eleven years old on her wedding day. It was, as I wrote, a different time.

St. Teresa, no longer married (yet the mother of two daughters and a son) returned to Portugal and founded a double monastery on the grounds of the family estate at Lorvau. She became a nun there after 1230, when she settled the succession dispute in Leon. Alfonso IX had died. His widow, another cousin named Berengaria, whose marriage Rome also anulled, asked the first wife to solve the problem of succession. St. Teresa permitted Beregaria’s son Fernando III of Castille (reigned 1217-1252) to rule in Leon.

St. Mafalda, upon her return to Portugal, entered religious life at Arouca Convent. She used her royal connections to obtain generous funding for a home for a widows, a hostel for travelers, the restoration of Oporto Cathedral, and other charitable works.

St. Sanchia retired from court life upon the death of her father in 1211. She helped the Francicans and the Dominicans expand into Portugal. And she founded a convent at Celles and became a nun there.

I could take this opportunity to defend the merits of monasticism against those who impugn it, but I have done so in other posts; I do not feel like repeating myself in that regard at this time. But I do make this point: These women, within the rules of society at their place and in their time, pursued holy lives. They helped other people and did not use their royal connections for their own benefit. We should honor their memories and thank God that they lived.

Feast of St. Emily de Vialar (June 17)

The Dream of Saint Joseph (Painted 1773-1774), by Anton Raphael Mengs

SAINT EMILY (EMILIE) DE VIALAR (1797-1856)

Founder of the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Apparition

http://www.stjoseph-apparition.org/

Members of religious orders are among the greatest treasures of the Church and the human race in general. These religious devote their lives to prayer and the service of God and their fellow human beings. And the study of history tells me that monks and nuns have preserved knowledge, provided medicines, served as missionaries, and cared for the vulnerable people around them for centuries. Thus I am especially fond of adding founders of religious orders to my Ecumenical Calendar of Saints’ Days and Holy Days.

Let us consider one such saint, Emily (Emilie) de Vialar. She was born to money in 1797. Her father, a physician in Gaillac, in southwestern France, sent her to school in Paris when she was seven years old. Eight years later, he brought her back home after the death of her mother. The saint’s father wanted her find a suitable husband, but she had a different goal: to enter religious life and serve God and the poor and marginalized in society. Emily began this work as a young woman in her father’s home, for she delivered medicines, clothing, and hot soup to people in her town. Sometimes she did not even leave home to do this, for people came to her front door. The saint and her father argued over their differing visions of her future, but Emily was focused on the mystery of the Incarnation and its implications for her life. She was determined to serve God in those around her.

In 1832, when the saint was 35 years old, her grandfather died and left her a large inheritance. She used it to found her order, the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Incarnation, and began with one house and a few sisters. By the time she died, on August 24, 1856, the number of houses had grown to forty, located in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. These were twenty-four years of service and struggle. For example, the saint and some sisters lent aid during the 1835 cholera epidemic in Algeria then commenced missionary work there. And the saint went bankrupt in 1851 due to mismanagement by her financial advisor. So she and her sisters themselves became like those they sought to help. Fortunately, Eugene de Mazenod, Bishop of Marseilles, rescued them and enabled them build up the order again.

Pope Pius XII beatified the saint in 1939 and canonized her in 1951.

Here are some quotes from St. Emily de Vialar:

“Since God does so much for me, what could I not do for him?”

“Quietly to trust in God is better than trying to safeguard material interests: I learned that by bitter experience.”

“My only desire is to accomplish God’s will.”

Her last words: “Love one another.”

Today the members of the order continue the good work the saint began. Among other things, they participate in foreign missions, provide nursing services to the sick, visit the bereaved, take the Eucharist to the sick, instruct converts, and offer psychological counseling. And it all started with a young woman who preferred a life of service to one of comfort. She chose the better part.

For this post I have selected scriptural readings and written a collect.

1 Kings 17:8-16

Psalm 23

James 1:22-27

Matthew 6:19-21

Compassionate God, we thank you for the holy example of the life of Saint Emily de Vialar, who served you faithfully during difficult times. May we also persevere in obeying and following you when circumstances are hard and the light at the end of the tunnel is either dim or absent or seemingly an oncoming train. May we strive always to be faithful, leaving questions of success to you. In the name of Jesus, who, though rich, became poor for our sakes, and suffered much distress and humiliation, and who reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen.
