Thunder on the left THE MAKING OF REDS

On the box-office coattails of 1978's Heaven Can Wait, Warren Beatty seized his chance to defy Hollywood wisdom by making Reds, a big-budget docudrama sympathetic to the Russian Revolution. PETER BISKIND recaptures the star-director-producer's creative obsession, from the volatile scriptwriting wars to the relentless retakes that reduced Jack Nicholson nearly to tears and helped send Beatty's romance with Diane Keaton into meltdown. The result: a stunning three-hour-and-twenty-minute epic about American Communists
