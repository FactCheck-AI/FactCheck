After having trained at the Gaumont film company, director Jacques Feyder (1885-1948) broke through with L'Atlantide, a stunning desert fantasy based on the novel by Pierre Benoît.

Two French legionnaires become lost in the Sahara and discover the legendary kingdom of Atlantis, where they fall under the spell of the irresistible queen Antinea (Stacia Napierkowska). Large parts of this nearly three-hour-long heroic epic were shot on location in the Sahara, a bold decision which proved very successful for Feyder: L'Atlantide was immensely popular with audiences worldwide.

Musical accompaniment by: Capital Trio and percussionist Udo Demandt. The members of the Capital Trio are: Martin de Ruiter (bandoneon), Annie Tångberg (cello and electronics) and Andreas Suntrop (electrical guitar and sound effects).
