Join us for a Q&A with director Jean Pierre Bekolo following the screening.

After an eight-year hiatus, maverick Cameroonian director Jean-Pierre Bekolo returned with his magnum opus, Les Saignantes. This superbly photographed, stylishly edited, and tastefully scored film centers two young femme fatales who set out to rid a futuristic country of its corrupt and sex-obsessed crop of powerful men. Young, fashionable, and lethal, the pair are on a mission to change the destiny of their country. Reveling in its display of excess and committed to aesthetics of cool, Les Saignantes marked one of the very first science fiction films to come out of Africa.
