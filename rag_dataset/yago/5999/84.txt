Backbeat – the adaptation of the 1994 film by Iain Softley on the birth of The Beatles – is rock 'n' rolling its way to London's Duke of York Theatre for its West End premiere.

Backbeat is the story of how the Beatles 'became' the Beatles – when John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Pete Best and Stuart Sutcliffe embarked on their journey from the famous docks of Liverpool to search for success in the seedy red light district of Hamburg.

The compelling triangular relationship between the band's original bassist Stuart Sutcliffe, the striking German photographer Astrid Kirchherr with whom he fell in love, and his best friend John Lennon, became an intrinsic part of The Beatles' story – and put them on an unstoppable trajectory onto the world stage.

Directed by the award-winning David Leveaux, Backbeat features the all-time rock 'n' roll classics that the Beatles cut their teeth with Twist & Shout, Rock 'N' Roll Music, Long Tall Sally, Please Mr Postman and Money - live on stage as performed by 'The Beatles'.
