FYI...

Track Record: Since making his big-screen debut with Backbeat in 1994, Iain Softley has proved to be one of Britain's most diverse directors. Whatever the genre, all of his films share an intelligence and striking visuals - from the high-tech fun of Hackers (1995) to the sci-fi kookiness of K-PAX (2001). He's recently returned to Hollywood to make supernatural thriller The Skeleton Key, with Kate Hudson and John Hurt.

Go Figure: 1998 - the year Softley first planned to make a supernatural thriller, a British pic called The Boathouse (with Milla Jovovich).

UK OK? Softley has made his last two films in Hollywood but his next movie, Trap For Cinderella, is set in the south of France and will be an independently-funded erotic thriller.

Yes, Really: Angelina Jolie is keen to reteam with her Hackers director on the erotic thriller. If she does, she'd be the first actor he's used in more than one movie.
