The official remake of Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai?, a 1980s cult classic starring Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil is all set to hit the screens on April 12, 2019. A modern take on its original version, the remake features a stellar cast which includes Nandita Das, Manav Kaul and Saurabh Shukla. Much like its original version, the remake which is written and directed by Soumitra Ranade of the Jajantaram Mamantaram fame, will explore the theme of personal and societal struggles in today’s times.

The '80s film dealt with the common man’s anger in the face of continued political, social and cultural breakdowns. He is angered by the rampant corruption, the ruling political class and the hypocrisy. But most importantly, he is angry at himself for being powerless. Speaking about the remake of this film, director Soumitra Ranade says,”I think India is angrier now than it has ever been before. It is angry against the system that has continually failed its people. With no real hope of change, this anger spills out brutally, either on news channels or through social media.”

“Resistance, rebellion and revolt are basic human rights perhaps as important as food, shelter and education. If we suppress these for too long there will be bottled up anger of an entire nation that will explode sooner rather than later.The film echos the voice of the people and through its release, it is only natural that it reaches back to them,” he added

“Soumitra is one of the finest human beings I know and the journey of making Albert Pinto Ko Gussa Kyun Aata Hai? was made special because of his commitment and passion to the story he so wanted to tell,” she added.

According to director Soumitra Ranade, the film is only a “conceptual remake” of the classic directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza in 1980. While the names of the characters and the disposition of Albert Pinto remains the same, what has changed is the milieu, the belief systems and the world view of the characters.
