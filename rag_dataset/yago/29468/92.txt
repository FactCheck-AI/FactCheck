Happy 30th anniversary to the former president and first lady!

Barack and Michelle Obama were married on this day in 1992 at Trinity United Church in Washington Heights, with a reception at the South Shore Cultural Center.

Can we all just take a moment to admire Michelle’s enduring elegance in her pouffy '90s veil.

If you really want to celebrate one of Chi’s favorite political love stories, consider visiting the Hyde Park corner where the couple had their first kiss.
