This is one of those places in Minneapolis that can make you say, is this really in Minneapolis? It is that spectacular.

The church was organized as Hennepin Avenue Methodist Episcopal Church in 1875 by about ninety members of Centenary church, which at the time was the only Methodist church in the city. The Quaker church organized the Sunday school.

During the 1960s, the ground around the Lowry Hill I-94 tunnel was frozen with special refrigeration equipment to protect the church from structural damage in case the tunnel walls should collapse during construction.

The church stands on land donated by T. B. Walker, a trustee of the church. Walker also donated several paintings to decorate the Sunday school. His wife, Harriet G. Walker, was a member.

If you know the skyline of Minneapolis at all, you know the magnificence of the towering spire which can be easily viewed many places on the western section of downtown anywhere close to Loring Park. The church is known for its Christmas pageant and its outreach to the community.

I know of the church because of its gorgeous architecture. I could spend weeks attempting to capture this amazing edifice but alas time is limited and I had a morning. I decided to focus on the interior. I knew I was going to be using a very wide lens, like say a 14mm but I also wanted to attempt some panorama images with an ultra wide lens. These images are the result of a morning of experimenting. I hope you enjoy them.

So if you have not been to investigate this incredible work of art I encourage you to put it on your calendar and get over there to see this majestic work.

These prints are available at the gallery.
