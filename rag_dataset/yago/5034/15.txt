Jimmy Fallon may have been joking about the royal baby on Monday, but Tuesday found him paying attention to a much more important child: his own!

The “Late Night With Jimmy Fallon” host, 38, and producer wife Nancy Juvonen, 46, welcomed a baby girl at 6:21 a.m., the comedian’s rep told People.

The couple met on the rom-com “Fever Pitch,” costarring Fallon and Drew Barrymore, whose production company is co-run by Juvonen, the mag said. They married in 2007.

It’s a first marriage and first child for both.

Fallon, of course, is on tap to take over for Jay Leno on “The Tonight Show” in February. But that new baby is going to have to wait its turn.
