Ever since Jimmy Fallon and Nancy Juvonen wed in 2007, we've gotten glimpses of their marriage over the years through their rare red carpet appearances and adorable chats on The Tonight Show. And we can't help but wonder: how does one get a relationship like that? Well, apparently, you need Drew Barrymore.

The couple first met through Drew when Nancy visited the Saturday Night Live set. During a recent episode of The Tonight Show: At Home Edition, Nancy said Jimmy left a lasting impression by reaching out to her in an otherwise "intimidating" environment. They later reunited on the set of 2005's Fever Pitch. Although Drew and Jimmy played onscreen love interests, a real-life romance between Nancy (who was a producer on the movie) and the talk show host eventually blossomed. In August 2007, Jimmy proposed to Nancy at her parents' summer home in New Hampshire.
