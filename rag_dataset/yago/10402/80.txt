BERLIN — The 7th French Film Week in Berlin kicks off June 14 with Benoit Jacquot’s “L’intouchable” (The Untouchable).

Jacquot and the film’s star Isild Le Besco will attend the event to present the pic, about a young French actress who travels to India to search for her unknown father.

Also unspooling as part of the fest is Tony Gatlif’s “Transylvania,” about a woman who finds herself on an emotional journey through Romania.

Star Birol Unel is expected to attend a special screening, which will be held on the eve of the fest’s official start.

Catherine Corsini’s literary bedroom comedy “Les ambitieux” (Ambitious) will close the fest on June 20.

The French Film Week annually presents a diverse selection of recent French feature film productions in Berlin.

Some 16 pics of all genres are screened at the famed Cinema Paris as well as at the Filmtheater am Friedrichshain.

In addition, the Francocine side bar offers a separate selection of French-language titles from Belgium, Quebec and Switzerland. This year’s screeners include Jean-Stephane Bron’s Swiss comedy “Mon frere se marie,” about a Swiss couple preparing to meet the Vietnamese mother of their adopted son, and Lucas Belvaux’s Belgian comedy-drama “La Raison de plus faible” (The Right of the Weakest), about a group of unemployed steel workers who turn to crime.
