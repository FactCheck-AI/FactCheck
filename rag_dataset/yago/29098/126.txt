Happy Birthday to Princess Marie of Denmark, who turns 42 today! Born in Paris to French parents, she grew up in Switzerland, was educated in Switzerland and the US, and worked in public relations and advertising. In 2008, she married Prince Joachim of Denmark, the second son of Queen Margrethe. The couple have two children, Prince Henrik and Princess Athena, in addition to Prince Nikolai and Prince Felix, from Prince Joachimâ€™s first marriage. Princess Marie is a working member of the Royal Family, and has been involved with quite a few charities and patronages, including food preparation and food waste. I wish HRH a very Happy Birthday and a long future reign!
