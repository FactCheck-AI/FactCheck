The Two Isabellas of King John

192 p.

King John of England was married to two women: Isabella of Gloucester and Isabelle of Angoulême. The two women were central to shaping John and his reign, each in her own way molding the king and each other over their lives. Little is known about Isabella of Gloucester and she has largely become an historical footnote; Isabelle of Angoulême has a reputation as a witch and poisoner. However, both were products of their time, victims and pawns of the powerful men whose voices overwrote the experiences of women. By examining these two very different women through a modern feminist lens, The Two Isabellas offers new insight into one of England lesser-known queens and a different interpretation of one of its least popular kings. In The Two Isabellas of King John, Kristen McQuinn offers new and intriguing insights into two of England important yet little understood queen-consorts, the wives of King John. Taking a feminist light, McQuinn brightly shines it on both England least well-known consort, Isabella of Glouce

ster, his first wife, and one of its least popular, Isabelle of Angoulême, his child bride. [Publisher's Text].
