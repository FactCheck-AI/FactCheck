Tucked away on 2 Foster Street in Surry Hills, just off Elizabeth Street, the Hotel Hollywood is a hidden gem in the city fringe. Originally known as the Nevada Hotel it had its name changed in October 1941 to The Hotel Hollywood. It was designed by architect John M Hellyer and built by W.M. Hughes and Co. P/L. When completed in 1940 the hotel formed part of the 'cinema' enclave with the film distribution offices of 20th Century Fox and Paramount nearby. There have been no significant recorded changes to the building after its construction.

The Hotel Hollywood is one of five similar style hotels built in the southern precinct of the city within a short period between 1938 and 1942. The others are the Australian, the Clare Inn, Sutherlands and the Civic. The Hotel Hollywood is the only one to have survived intact without recorded alterations or modifications of any kind either externally or internally.
