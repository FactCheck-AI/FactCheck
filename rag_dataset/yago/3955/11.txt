She's best known for starring in the 90s movies The Last Of The Mohicans, 12 Monkeys and The General's Daughter as well as ABC's recent TV drama series Revenge.

And on Wednesday, Madeleine Stowe stepped out for some fresh air and exercise during the coronavirus lockdown in LA.

The actress, 61, was joined on her walk by her husband, Private Practoce star Brian Benben, 63.

The couple appeared upbeat as they strode out around their Pacific Palisades neighborhood.

Stowe was dressed in a long-sleeve Duke University top and blue jeans.

She added black boots and sunglasses and left her long dark hair loose.

Benben opted for a long-sleeve gray top and black shorts, adding black socks and trainers and a bandana around his neck. He sported a peaked cap and shades.

Stowe and Benben met on the set of NBC's The Gangster Chronicles and married in 1982.

They share a daughter May who was born in 2006.

Most recently, Stowe appeared in the Netflix series soundtrack while Benben was last seen on Bravo's Imposters that ran for two seasons in 2017 and 2018.
