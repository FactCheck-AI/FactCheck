From school bells, to wedding bells — to divorce lawyers? It seems Saved by the Bell sweethearts Zack and Kelly didn’t last the long haul.

Despite the best wedding possible set in Las Vegas, the on-again, off-again romance between Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) and Kelly Kapowski (Tiffani Thiessen) wasn’t destined to last, according to executive producer Peter Engel, which begs the question: Would they still be married now?

“Probably not,” said Engel in an interview with TVLine. “Well, they’d be married — but not to each other.” Even with their stories ended by a two-hour TV movie in 1994, the couple would have to experience happily ever after with someone else.

The producer’s latest book, I Was Saved by the Bell: Stories of Life, Love, and Dreams That Do Come True, has more tantalizing stories from the past and present of the hit show, including Jessie’s (Elizabeth Berkley) infamous caffeine pills really being speed.

As for life outside of love, Engel also shared where the rest of the Bayside crew probably ended up. “Zack would probably be the host of a game show or talk show, or he’d be managing a hedge fund. Slater (Mario Lopez) would be a high school football coach. Screech (Dustin Diamond) would be Bill Gates,” he said. “Jessie would have just to Donald Trump. Lisa (Lark Voorhies) would probably be Vera Wang, or a buyer at Neiman Marcus; and Kelly would be married with children and have a cooking show on the Food Network, which Tiffani Thiessen has — and I watch!”
