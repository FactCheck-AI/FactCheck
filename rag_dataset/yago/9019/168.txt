Anna Faris and Dan Fogler are starring alongside Topher Grace in Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment’s “Kids in America,” a comedy directed by Michael Dowse being produced by Brian Grazer, Gordon Kaywin and Grace.

The movie revolves around Grace, a recent college graduate, Faris, his twin sister, and Fogler, his best friend, during their misadventures at a raucous Labor Day party in 1988. Jeff and Jackie Filgo wrote the screenplay from a story by Dowse.

Teresa Palmer (“The Grudge 2”) also is on board the production, as the girl of Grace’s dreams.

Production is scheduled to begin the week of Feb. 19.

Faris, who starred in all four of the “Scary Movie” films, is attached to star in an untitled comedy about a centerfold for Happy Madison and Paramount. The project is based on her idea and is being written by Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten “Kiwi” Smith. Faris, whose “Smiley Face” premiered at Sundance, next appears in “Mama’s Boy” opposite Jon Heder and Diane Keaton. She is repped by Gersh, Raw Talent and attorney Robert Offer.

Fogler won a Tony in 2004 for featured actor in a musical for his performance in “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” He most recently appeared in Dimension’s comedy “School for Scoundrels” and next appears in “Balls of Fury” and “Fanboys.” He is repped by WMA.
