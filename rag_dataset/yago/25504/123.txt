Anyone who was raised as a Christian knows that deep in your consciousness are buried irrational childhood ideas, beliefs, and hopes. Your rational adult self may revise your views of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spigot (as Rowan Atkinson would say), but you never get rid of all that embedded Stuff.

The Player author Michael Tolkin wrote and directed the underappreciated The Rapture, starring Mimi Rogers and David Duchovny, which Fine Line Features released without much fanfare in 1991. The film clearly tapped into my parental separation issues, but it was more than that. No other screening has ever left me sobbing in the car afterwards, unable to drive. The movie posits that the end of the world, The Rapture, when earth and heaven finally come together, actually takes place. It taps into hopes that maybe there really is heaven and redemption, and that parents and children separated by death can be reunited in heaven. Itâ€™s heady stuff.
