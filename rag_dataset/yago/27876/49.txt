Biography

Margaret (Anjou) England is Notable.

Margaret of Anjou (Fr: Marguerite d'Anjou) (23 Mar 1430 – 25 Aug 1482) was the wife of Henry VI of England. She was Queen consort from 1445 to 1461, and 1470 to 1471. She also claimed to be Queen consort of France from 1445 to 1453. Born in the Duchy of Lorraine, to the House of Valois-Anjou, Margaret was the second eldest daughter of René I of Naples and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.

She was one of the principal figures in the Wars of the Roses, and at times personally led the Lancastrian faction. Due to her husband's frequent bouts of insanity, Margaret ruled in his place. In 1447, she and the Beaufort party had the Duke of Gloucester arrested for treason; five days later he was found dead in his bed, but there is no proof that he was murdered. The war of 1449, in which Normandy was lost, was laid to her charge. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the Yorkist faction headed by Richard, Duke of York, causing the spark that ignited a civil conflict that lasted for over thirty years, decimated the old nobility of England, and caused the deaths of thousands of men, including her only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.

Margaret was taken prisoner by the victorious Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. She was imprisoned variously at the Tower of London, and at Windsor and Wallingford Castles, but released in November 1475 on payment of 50,000 crowns ransom demanded by King Edward IV. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king, and she died there at the age of 52.

She died at Dampierre-sur-Loire Castle, near Saumur, 25 August 1482 and was buried in Angers Cathedral.
