Happy Birthday to Dowager Queen Sirikit of Thailand, who turns 85 today. The eldest daughter of Prince Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara and Mom Luang Bua Snidvongs, she grew up at the Deves Palace in Bangkok, and studied in Thailand, England, France, and Switzerland. In 1950, she married King Bhumibol Adulyadej, just a week before their coronation. The couple had four children. One of the most glamorous Queens in the 50s and 60s, in 1956, Queen Sirikit acted as Regent while the King undertook the traditional period as a Buddhist monk. She performed her duties so well that she was officially named ‘Regent of Thailand’. Queen Sirikit has written a book, and composed a couple of songs. She was widowed last year, and has been in hospital multiple times recently. We wish HM a very Happy Birthday and many Happy Returns!
