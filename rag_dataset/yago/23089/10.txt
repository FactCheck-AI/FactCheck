Pierce Brosnan’s wife Keely Shaye Smith has shared a sweet message in celebration of their 23rd wedding anniversary.

On Sunday the former model shared three photos to Instagram from their wedding with a caption highlighting the day it took place – August 4 2001, at Ashford Castle in County Mayo, Ireland.

The rest of the caption read: “’You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known.’

“Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together.

“May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flys on love’s wings.”

In the first photo, Brosnan can be seen dressed in a tuxedo, white waistcoat and silver tie while Smith dons an elegant white gown with lace sleeves paired with a long veil.

The couple, who share two sons together, Dylan and Paris, met in 1994.

In April, Smith, 60, recounted when they met and said in a social media post: “Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later.”

James Bond star Brosnan, 71, was previously married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris and they had one son together, Sean.

The Irish-American actor also adopted Harris’ children Charlotte and Chris after he married their mother.

Cassandra died from ovarian cancer in 1991 and Charlotte died of the same disease in 2013.
