Paparazzi have a reputation for doing whatever it takes to get their shot, and one celebrity who has known this for quite a long time is Lauren Holly.

Holly was married to her "Dumb & Dumber" costar Jim Carrey for a year in the mid-90s, and she tells "Oprah: Where Are They Now?" that back then is when the tabloid-driven celebrity obsession really began to take off.

"I think I was sort of there for all the beginning of the paparazzi and the magazines and whatnot because I was in a relationship with Jim Carrey," Holly says. "That was really when that sort of paparazzi culture came about."

Soon enough, the actress realized just how far the photographers were willing to go.

"One night, we realized there were some paparazzi who were living in our yard, underneath the tennis court, in order to get pictures of us inside the house," Holly says.

It was more than just unnerving.

"It was crazy," she says.

Holly opens up more about that relationship, her sons and her views on plastic surgery on this weekend's "Oprah: Where Are They Now," Saturday, 10 p.m. ET on OWN.
