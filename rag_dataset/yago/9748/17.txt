It's not a success, but it's a closed mist, and kind of fun in its own ways and means.

Despite its occasional flashes of brilliance (every Rudolph film has them), this unsavory stew never comes to a boil.

VarietyEmanuel Levy

Despite a star cast (Nick Nolte, Emily Watson), Rudolph's comedy-mystery is a minor, trivial film that tries to be whimsical but lacks humor or fresh angle on the Hollywood's cherished genres of noir and screwball.

Maybe a better idea would have been to have Trixie and Frances McDormand's Fargo cop start a detective agency.

Film Comment MagazineGavin Smith

Alan Rudolph's Trixie is a delightful mystery/conspiracy thriller genre pastiche, full of his customary inversions, mirrorings, and visual mischief.
