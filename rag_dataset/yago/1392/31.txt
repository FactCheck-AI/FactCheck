Welcoming M Night Shyamalan to the 2019 MAX Mainstage.

Screenwriter, director, producer…he’s done it all! Shyamalan began making films at a young age and by 16 he had completed 45 short films. He attended New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts to study filmmaking. During his final year at NYU, he wrote Praying with Anger, a semi-autobiographical screenplay. The film was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 1999, The Sixth Sense, starring Bruce Willis, catapulted Shyamalan into stardom and he became one of the most sought after young filmmakers in Hollywood. One of the highest grossing films of all time, The Sixth Sense received a total of six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. From The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable to The Village, Shyamalan’s films have amassed more than $3 billion worldwide. Besides catching him as a keynote speaker this year at MAX, you can also see M Night’s work on television, where he’s producing a half-hour thriller series for Apple TV.
