This fall, Paul Auster is going where not even fellow Brooklyn novelist-cum-indie auteur Norman Mailer has gone before — straight to video. Trimark will issue Auster’s Lulu on the Bridge — a romantic mystery shot in ’97, panned at Cannes the year after, and released in Europe — on Sept. 21. In addition to marketing the cast (Harvey Keitel, Mira Sorvino, Willem Dafoe, Gina Gershon, Vanessa Redgrave, Lou Reed), a Trimark spokesman says the distributor will try to sell viewers on Lulu ”by playing up the action.”
