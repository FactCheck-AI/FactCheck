The visually bold and striking Dick Tracy packs a wallop as sharp as Tracy's jaw.

Imaginative performances color this extraordinary action flick directed by and starring Warren Beatty, Grammy-winning singer Madonna, Oscar nominee Al Pacino (Best Supporting Actor, Dick Tracy, 1990) and Dustin Hoffman.

When gang lord Big Boy Caprice unites the town's racketeers and gangsters, police detective Dick Tracy devotes his career to foiling the entire bunch of bad guys. Complete with richly evocative music -- including Stephen Sondheim's Academy Award-winning "Sooner or Later (I Always Get My Man)" (Best Original Song, 1990).
