NEW YORK — Miramax Films has pacted with feature and television writer Scott Fifer to script two upcoming projects, a remake of Oscar-nominated Belgian comedy “Everybody Famous!” and “Project Bigfoot,” a wish-fulfillment family adventure set in the world of monster trucks.

Nominated for the best foreign-language film Oscar in 2001, “Everybody Famous!” centers on a middle-aged factory worker who, after trying to pin his own failed ambitions as a songwriter on his teenage daughter, kidnaps a pop star in order to realize his music dreams. Fifer has signed to rewrite the project based on Belgian director Dominique Deruddere’s original screenplay.

Radar Pictures is producing the remake. Miramax senior VP of production and development Michelle Raimo and director of production and development Eric Robinson are overseeing the project for the studio, reporting to co-prexy of production Meryl Poster. Shawn Gorman will shepherd the pic for Radar.

Eric Bross will direct “Project Bigfoot,” which is described as “Spy Kids” meets “The Love Bug,” involving a truck with its own distinct personality. Fifer is scripting from an idea by producers Martha Chang and Michael Braverman. Miramax exec Laura Rister and production co-prexy Bob Osher will oversee the project.

“Overcommitted,” Fifer’s romantic comedy script about a marriage-phobic man who lands in multiple alternate realities, is set up at New Line Cinema, with Neal Moritz, Mark Williams and Michael Pierce producing. The writer’s Nicholl Fellowship-winning script “Starstruck” was acquired by Wes Craven.

Fifer’s deal was brokered for Miramax by senior VP of business and legal affairs Barry Littman.
