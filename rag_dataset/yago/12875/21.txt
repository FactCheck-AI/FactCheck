EVERYBODY’S FAMOUS!

He wants his daughter to break into showbiz in the worst way.In Flemish with English subtitles. Running time: 99 minutes. Rated R (violence, sex). At the Lincoln Plaza, the Angelika.

‘EVERYBODY’S Famous!,” Belgium’s entry for this year’s foreign-language film Oscar, is a sweet and funny little comedy about a dad who’ll do anything to get his daughter her 15 minutes in the limelight.

Seventeen-year-old Marva (Eva Van der Gucht) has a pleasant enough voice, but she’s chubby and very insecure onstage, so her renditions of pop tunes consistently bomb in talent competitions.

That doesn’t deter her dad, Jean (Jesse de Pauw), an aspiring songwriter who takes desperate measures after being laid off from his job at a bottle factory.

On the way home, he encounters Debbie (Thekla Reuten), a beautiful pop singer with several hits. He drugs her, and with help from Willy (Werner de Schmidt), a younger co-worker who no more brains than Jean, ties her up and hides her in a remote cabin.

Debbie’s songs fly to the top of the charts after her disappearance, much to the delight of her manager, Michael (Viktor Low).

When Jean, wearing a Michael Jackson mask, approaches Michael demanding he turn a melody he’s hummed into a tape recorder into a song, Michael agrees – provided he keeps Debbie temporarily out of circulation to further boost sales.

Meanwhile, Debbie and Willy have become lovers. Michael has relieved Marva of her virginity – and arranged for her TV debut as “Lonesome Zorra,” wearing a mask, a Spanish hat and boots and belting out Dad’s hilariously overwrought ballad, “Lucky Manuelo.”

Writer-director Dominique Deruddere gets consistently good performances from his enthusiastic cast.

The charming “Everybody’s Famous” is more than a little predictable and not particularly realistic – but that shouldn’t seriously discourage anyone looking for light summer fun with a Flemish accent.
