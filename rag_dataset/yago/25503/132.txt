Michael Tolkin on

The Rapture

One of the more unique projects of the decade, director/writer Michael Tolkin’s disturbing 1991 religious fantasy tells the story of Sharon (Mimi Rogers), a young libertine converted to born-again Christianity, who takes drastic measures to ensure that the coming “Rapture” will “save” her young daughter. It’s provocative, to say the least, and in his debut as a TFH Guru, Michael Tolkin puts it all in properly apocalyptic perspective.
