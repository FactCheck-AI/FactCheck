3. Special Effects We will be looking at examples of in-camera mechanical SPX (production-phase) and digital SPX (post production). The duties of SFX are fulfilled by the “special-effects unit” who is charged with preparing and executing process shots, miniatures, matte work, computer-generated images (CGI), and other technical shots. According to Barsam: Special Effects (SPX) is a term reserved for technology that creates images that would be too dangerous, too expenseive or impossible to achieve with ordinary cinematographic materials.
