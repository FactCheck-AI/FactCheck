Albert Pinto, a young Christian car mechanic from Mumbai, believes that if he works hard and imitates the wealthy, he might one day achieve success. The video portrays his rage. He cultivates cordial relationships with his clients, who are typically wealthy city dwellers who are constantly reminding him that good workers do not go on strikes and that strikes are the activity of lower-class individuals.

Pinto becomes upset with the workers' allegedly improper attitudes and assumes they are on strike for any reason. However, when Pinto's father, a mill worker, is abused by the low-class individuals hired by the mill owners, he discovers that it is the capitalists who are to blame for the suffering of the workers rather than the people themselves. He understands the justification for strikes as well. Pinto is still outraged at the end of the film, but this time, instead of the striking workers, he is angry at the capitalists.
