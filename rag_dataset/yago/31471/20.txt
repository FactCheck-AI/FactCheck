After leaving EA, Hawkins founded 3DO in 1991. Wikipedia writes: "Upon its release in 1993, the 3DO was the most powerful video game console at the time. Unfortunately, it was also the most expensive, costing a hefty US$700, compared to the low $100's of other systems. Sales were poor and the system's hopes were totally smashed in 1994 with the arrival of the Sony PlayStation, which beat the 3DO in power and price."
