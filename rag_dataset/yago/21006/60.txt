Harry Enfield and Chums stars Harry Enfield, Paul Whitehouse and Kathy Burke. The show features the well loved Kevin and Perry sketch. Kathy Burke plays Perry who tries to be a cool teenager, but clearly fancies his friend's mum. The sketch was so popular it was made into a film in 2000 called Kevin and Perry Go Large.
