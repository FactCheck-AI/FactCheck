The Story Behind the Name

Despite its name, Amaro Montenegro is not from the country of Montenegro. Instead, it is named after Princess Elena of Montenegro, who was part of the royal family of Italy and married to Victor Emmanuel III, the King of Italy, in the early 20th century.

Princess Elena was born in Cetinje, Montenegro, in 1873, and was the daughter of King Nicholas I of Montenegro. She received a European education and was fluent in several languages. She met Victor Emmanuel III, the future King of Italy, in 1895, and the two fell in love. They got married in 1896, and Princess Elena became the first queen of Italy born outside of Italy.

Princess Elena was well-known for her appreciation of fine food and drink, as well as her support for the arts. During a trip to Bologna, Italy, she discovered Amaro Montenegro and was so taken with the distinct flavor that she named it after herself. Since then, the liqueur has grown in popularity as a post-dinner digestif in Italy.
