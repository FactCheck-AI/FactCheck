Actor Kirk Cameron and singer-songwriter Warren Barfield will lead a marriage conference at First Baptist Church of Orange Park at 3 p.m. July 31.

The duo have been on the "Love Worth Fighting For" tour since February, according to a news release.

Best known as teenager Mike Seaver in the 1980s hit TV sitcom "Growing Pains," Cameron has been married to actress Chelsea Noble for 20 years while raising six children. In the 2008 movie "Fireproof," he portrayed a husband whose marriage was dissolving.

The tour is sponsored by Feed Your Faith (feedyourfaith.org), a non-profit group that sends Christian speakers and artists to raise money for charities in the southeast U.S.

"We're excited to partner with Kirk and Warren for this conference," David Tarkington, Senior Pastor of First Baptist Church of Orange Park, said in the release. "Our desire is that this event be a catalyst for a lifetime of marriage enrichment for couples in the community."

Also, tickets may be purchased at the door for $25 per person. Doors open at 2 p.m. for general admission. Purchased tickets are non-refundable.
