So, everyone who's seen it, how was this doc?

I loved it. To see her interact with her children was especially nice.

A lot of folks bitched that she's boring now compared to Truth or Dare, but wouldn't you know it...she's actually a better person.

She comes across as being very human and very likeable which I don't think we get to see often enough.

That's the only reason i'm buying this set, someone burned me the documentry on dvd so i've already seen it.

I didn't find the documentry that interesting, aside from a few moments. The live footage had really bad editing too, nothing as professional as Truth or Dare.

VC, you're going to be pressing that stop button 3 minutes through the movie when she starts discussing god with Stuart.

She's finally releasing the "American Life" video (Director's Cut).Better late than never,huh?

Jayardee...have you seen the Director's Cut of that video? It's really intense!

Yes i've seen it, and I think it really drives a point home. Had she released the video back in 2003 it probably would have been banned from MTV as usual so pulling it didn't really make much the difference.

The video really makes my stomach turn.

And i really thought the video was a done deal, i never expected it to be released.

It makes sense to release it now.Back in 2003,alot of Americans supported Bush and the war.The tables have turned,and now it's okay to publicly bash Bush and the war,lol.She won't get any flack for that video now.

Last week,when I was standing in line to buy tickets to her show,a bunch of us started talking about this documentary.One guy was like "It was so boring...Truth Or Dare was so much better".Apparently,alot of folks want her to act crazy,expose her boobs,and deep-throat a water bottle again,lol.They don't realize that she is now a 47-year old married mother of two.She has grown and evolved and is a completety different person than she was in 1991.Yes,"Truth Or Dare" is the better documentary,but I like seeing the "new" Madonna too.I think she's a better person these days,and she seems happier and more fulfilled than she was back then.

Looks like they missed a lot of good stuff (did she do the original verison of "Nothing Fails"....if so, what a missed opportunity to bring it back). And what the hell is "I Love New York" doing in there? Maybe that is a way of slipping it in to remind people of COADF, which this has nothing to do with. This seems like a good set of stuff, but probably should have been released before COADF. This might just kill any momentuem COADF had, although "Get Together" is supposed to be released the same day. Maybe people will pick up this CD/DVD along with "Get Together"?

I heard MTV wasn't going to play it (I heard this on some news program, maybe even MTV), so it was a premeptive strike. I still wish she would have done something better than the flag hag video she ended up releasing.

I won't be shocked if it helps the AL album a little bit (just a little bit).

live

cool... I was confused by the listing of Hollywood as a "remix" - I assume that means she did a remix of it live?

it was a dub version of the Jacques Lu Count mix that was done on the tour as a video montage featuring Tarot Cards and the Dancers... Madonna was changing costumes
