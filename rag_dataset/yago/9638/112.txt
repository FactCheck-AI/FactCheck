She's sexy.... She's deadly....She's Pervirella

The beautiful Pervirella nurtures a sex demon of incredible lethal powers within her ample bosom. Powers that are only contained by a mystic amulet with a rather loose clasp. Powers that can send her into a lethal mating frenzy from which no mortal can survive....though many try.

​

To regain her humanity she must travel the globe in search of the infamous elixir of life. An incredible adventure that takes her to every continent and exposes her to incredible dangers.

Her only weapon....uncontrollable deadly lust.
