BANGKOK: The Bureau of the Royal Household announced that Her Royal Highness Princess Bejaratana, the only daughter of Thailand’s late King Rama VI and Queen Suvadhana, passed away on Wednesday at the age of 85 at Siriraj Hospital in Bangkok due to blood infection.

Quoting the Bureau of the Royal Household, Thai News Agency (TNA) said that Princess Bejaratana was admitted to the Siriraj Hospital last Saturday after suffering from septicemia.

The Princess was born on November 24, 1925 at the Thep Santhan Pilas Throne Hall in the Grand Palace.

King Rama VI or King Vajiravudh was seriously ill at the time and he passed away just over 24 hours after the birth of his only daughter, who was, however, brought to his bedside.

Princess Bejraratana was first enrolled at Rajini School in Bangkok. But following the abdication of King Rama VII, it was decided that the Princess, nine years old at that time, should continue her studies overseas.

The Princess returned to Thailand in 1959 when she was 34 and she had since then devoted her time to projects initiated by her father.

She had also worked closely with Chulalongkorn University, Silpakorn University, Vajiravudh College, Vajira Hospital and the Sanam Chan Palace Restoration Project.

The Princess had devoted her time to projects initiated by her grandmother as well, including Rajini School and the Thai Red Cross Society.

A royal bathing rite for the late Princess was set at the Piman Rathaya Throne Hall in the Thai capital later today and the royal urn will then be installed in the Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall, to be given the highest honours according to the wishes of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej.

The public are allowed to pay their respects to the late Princess at Sala Sahathai Samakhom inside the Grand Palace from 1pm and 4pm today and members of the Royal Thai Family, the Royal Court and the public will observe a 100-day mourning period. – Bernama
