Upper Darby’ actress and comedian Tina Fey has co-created and will star in a Netflix comedy series based on the 1981 film “The Four Seasons,” writes Frank Rudnesky for Philly Voice.

Production will start this year and will include two former “30 Rock” collaborators, Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield.

The 1981 film was written and directed by Alan Alda. It explores the relationships among a group of married couples who vacation together each season of the year.

The original, nominated for a Golden Globe, starred Alda, Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, and Sandy Dennis. It was adapted into a CBS series in 1984.

Netflix has ordered eight episodes of the new series, written by Fey, Fisher, and Wigfield, who also executive produce with Fey’s husband, Jeff Richmond. Alan Alda is also a producer on the project.

The cast, aside from Fey, has not been revealed.

“The Four Seasons” will be Fey’s first starring TV role since “30 Rock” airing from 2006 to 2013.

She reprises her role as the high school teacher Ms. Norbury, in the Friday, Jan. 12 release of “Mean Girls” movie musical, which she wrote and produced.
