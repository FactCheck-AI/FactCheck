The stars have aligned for Trekkies through the wedding of Adam Nimoy, 61, son of the late Star Trek icon Leonard Nimoy, and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine actress Terry Farrell, 54.

The couple, who announced their engagement in August 2017, said their vows at City Hall in San Francisco.

Leonard Nimoy who was best known for playing Spock during the 1960s and 1970s on the hit sci-fi show, passed away in February 2015 following a battle with pulmonary disease.

However, the couple chose to involve him in a very special way on their big day by tying the knot on what would have been his 87th birthday.

Wedding guest and film critic Scott Mantz took to Twitter to announce the happy news on Monday.

Tweeting a photo of the couple straight after the ceremony, he excitedly captioned the shot with: 'Breaking news!! Adam Nimoy & Terry Farrell finally got married today at a civil ceremony at City Hall in San Francisco!'

He added: 'Today is the birthday of Adam's father. Big congrats to the happy couple!!'

Terry retweeted Mantz's photo and added: 'Freakin AWESOME day!!!!!!! Love ya all! Aka: Mrs. Adam Nimoy.'

The couple made their red carpet debut in 2016, before attending a Star Trek convention in Las Vegas in August 2017.

Terry, who played Jadzia Dax in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, delighted Trekkies in August when she confirmed their engagement on Twitter, telling a fan it was 'for real'.

This is the second marriage for both Terry and Adam.

The 54-year-old actress shares a son with her ex-husband Brian Baker, while the 61-year-old filmmaker has a son and daughter with his former wife Nancy.

In addition to appearing on the TV franchise, Leonard also played the elder Spock in the 2009 Star Trek movie and reprised the role in a brief appearance in the 2013 sequel, Star Trek Into Darkness, both directed by J. J. Abrams.

Adam has also directed and produced I Am Spock, a documentary starring his late father.
