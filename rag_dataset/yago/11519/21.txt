Theresa Lee Farrell was born on November 19, 1963 in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to her parents, Edwin Farrell, Jr. and his wife Kay (Bendickson) Farrell. She had one sister, Christine. Her parents divorced sometime during her childhood, and her mother remarried to David W. Grussendorf, who legally adopted Terry and Christine.

Terry grew up to pursue a modeling career and was picked up by Mademoiselle. She was also able to land a number of guest appearances on television shows from 1983 to 1992. But it was not until she went from a failed pilot of Red Dwarf USA in 1992 that she achieved some measure of fame. She was given the part of Jadzia Dax on a new show: Star Trek Deep Space Nine. She starred on this show for 6 seasons until the finale in 1998, and became a beloved charater by many. However, when her contract ended, she landed on her feet and began a part as Regina on a new show: Becker. This lasted 4 seasons (approx 1998 - 2002), at which point she began reexamining her goals and decided to withdraw from Hollywood.

Sometime near the end of her career, she married ex-Sprint spokesman Brian Baker (September 2002). They later had a child named Max Baker (born 2003), and decided to move as a family to Hershey, Pennsylvania, where she is teaching Yoga, is currently retired from acting and is focused on raising her son Max.
