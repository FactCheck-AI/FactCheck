The Thunder Child writes “A couple of weeks ago I shared the fact that Terry Farrell was returning to the acting stage in a play in Hershey, Pennsylvania, with her husband Brian Baker. Terry graciously consented to an interview with The Thunder Child, which you can read here: http://thethunderchild.com/Theatre/FarrellLoveLetters.html

Note: It’s about her life now, with only a couple of questions about DS9, but it’s a fun read. And if you go see the play, make sure you tell her you read about it in The Thunder Child!”
