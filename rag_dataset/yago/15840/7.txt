Mr Towb passed away peacefully in his London home on Friday after battling cancer for a short time.

As recently as December he appeared in the BBC's EastEnders programme as David, Janine Butcher's elderly fiancee.

He is survived by his wife, actress Diana Hoddinott, children Emily, Daniel and Joshua, and three granddaughters.

Joshua said his father was a great family man who loved his work.

"He loved his family very much," he said.

"But he never liked not to be working.

"He worked all the way through his illness as long as he could, right up until a few months ago."

He also performed in Little Shop of Horrors, Barmitzvah Boy, Death of a Salesman and The Mandate.

With the Royal Shakespeare Company Mr Towb helped bring Sherlock Holmes and Travesties to Broadway.

And back in his home town he most recently played Tiresias in Antigone at the Waterfront Hall, Belfast.

At Dublin's Abbey Theatre his plays included Philadelphia Here I Come, The Rivals and The Importance Of Being Earnest.

He also took roles in the films The 39 Steps, Patton, Digby the Biggest Dog in the World, Carry On at Your Convenience, and The Most Fertile Man In Ireland.

In it he played George Nathan who was trying to re-populate the Jewish community of Belfast.
