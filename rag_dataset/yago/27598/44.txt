Author Salman Rushdie, author of The Satanic Verses, is divorcing his fourth wife, actress Padma Lakshmi.

"Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage," his representative, Jin Auh, said in a statement on Monday.

"He asks that the media respect his privacy at this difficult time."

Christina Papadopoulos, Lakshmi's publicist, released a message from her client.

"After an eight-year relationship including over three years of marriage, Lakshmi regrets that their mutual efforts failed to make the marriage work."

The announcement comes only two weeks after the Indian-born Rushdie, 60,was given a British knighthood, leading to demonstrations by Muslims from different parts of the world.

In 1989, Iran's late spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a fatwa ordering Muslims to kill the writer becauseKhomeini said The Satanic Verses insulted Islam. It forced Rushdie into hiding for a decade.

Rushdie's other novels include The Moor's Last Sigh and the 1981 Booker-winning Midnight's Children.

Lakshmi, 37, began her career as a model and is an actress and a Food Network TV host.She fronted Melting Pot and can now be seen on Top Chef.

Born in southern India, the host/model studied theatre arts in the U.S. and has lived in Spain and Italy.She published a cookbook in 1999 entitled Easy Exotic: A Model's Lowfat Recipes from Around the World.

The two met in 1999 at a party and British tabloids had a field day mocking their age difference and comparing their physical looks.

"You know, it's not supposed to be permitted to be gorgeous and really smart and also very nice," Rushdie told The Times of London in a 2005 interview.

"It feels very odd to see newspaper articles saying 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Why Do Beautiful Women Love Ugly Men?' But at this stage, I'm kind of resigned to it at — as you say —pushing 60."
