Only two weeks on from his acceptance of a knighthood, which provoked an international furore, Salman Rushdie is in the news again. He and his wife, Padma Lakshmi, are to divorce after three years of marriage.

In a statement from Rushdie's spokeswoman, Jin Auh, issued in New York today, Rushdie said that he "has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage" and requests that "the media respect his privacy at this difficult time".

Rushdie and Lakshmi, a former model and actor who currently hosts the cookery programme Top Chef on the US's Bravo cable network, met in Manhattan in 1999 at the launch party of Tina Brown's ill-feted Talk magazine. Following Rushdie's separation from his third wife, Elizabeth West, they began a relationship which culminated in marriage in 2004. Throughout the duration of their relationship, the couple has been subject to substantial media speculation based in large part on the gap in their ages (Rushdie is 60, Lakshmi 37).

Rushdie first rose to prominence in the literary world with the publication of his postcolonial masterpiece Midnight's Children, which won the Booker prize in 1981. However, it was his 1988 novel, The Satanic Verses, which gained him international prominence for all the wrong reasons, after the late Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, condemned the book as blasphemous and issued a fatwa against its author, forcing him into hiding for the following nine years. His receipt of a knighthood for services to literature last month reignited the controversy, sparking protests in Pakistan, Iran and Malaysia and culminating in renewed death threats against the author.
