Escaped convicts and the family they’ve kidnapped engage in an overnight battle with vampires on the Mexican border in Robert Rodriguez’s FROM DUSK TILL DAWN! Presented in 35mm by El Rey Network!

The ‘From Dusk Till Dawn: The Series’ will also screen in the lobby prior to the film each night!

Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn is everything you’d want in an all action horror vampire movie. Escaped convict brothers with mental issues? Check. Sexy vampire queens? Check. Dirty jokes and deadly monsters? Check, check. Harvey Keitel as a bow-wielding pastor who lost his faith? Check. What starts out as questionable morality of two criminals who kidnap a family in order to flee into Mexico turns into a struggle of mortality as they surprisingly find themselves in an overnight battle to save their souls from bloodthirsty biker vampires. From Dusk Till Dawn is a fantastically unique twist on the generic vampire tale: unwitting visitors who find themselves fighting the undead done as only the Rodriguez/Tarantino combo could do. A big screen must see.
