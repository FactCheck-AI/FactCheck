Letizia Ramolino-Bonaparte produced a number of gorgeous daughters, including Caroline who married Joachim Murat, one of Napoleon's generals. Napoleon made them King and Queen of Naples in 1808; he was executed in 1815 and she fled to Austria. The absence of Italian artists is noteworthy in this album. She was educated with Empress JosÃ©phine's daughter Hortense at a school run by Jeanne Campan. JosÃ©phine persuaded Napoleon to allow Caroline and Joachim to marry whereupon Caroline plotted against JosÃ©phine (sounds like President Obama trying to work with USA Republicans).

According to her Wikipedia article, RenÃ© Auberjonois, who played Father Mulcahy in the Korean War anti-war comedy movie M*A*S*H as well as other roles, is her great-great-great-grandson.
