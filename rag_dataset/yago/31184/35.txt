After graduating from Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service with a BSFS and an MSFS, HRH Princess Ghida Talal pursued a career in journalism in London. In 1991, she married HRH Prince Talal Bin Muhammad of Jordan. Soon after, the late King Hussein asked her to establish the International Press Office of the Royal Hashemite Court and to become his Press Secretary.

In October 2001, HM King Abdullah II appointed her as the Chairperson of the King Hussein Cancer Foundation. As the wife of a cancer survivor, Princess Ghida devoted herself to the fight against cancer and is a tireless fundraiser and advocate for the King Hussein Cancer Foundation and Center.

Princess Ghida has served on the Board of Georgetown University and the MSFS program. In February 2020, Georgetown University honored the Princess with the “1820 Graduate Award” in recognition of her outstanding humanitarian leadership and service to the University. The 1820 Graduate Award is named for the year that Georgetown’s Graduate School was founded, and recognizes leading graduate alumni who embody the ideals of the Georgetown alumni community.
