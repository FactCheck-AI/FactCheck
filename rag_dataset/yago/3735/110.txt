Professor John McCarthy was a US computer scientist credited with coining the term “artificial intelligence” in 1955 and inventing a computer language — Lisp — which became the standard code used by researchers in the AI field.

McCarthy became interested in the concept of artificial intelligence in 1948 when computers were giant “difference engine” machines used for wartime code-breaking. He believed, displaying an impressive leap of imagination, that all aspects of human intelligence could one day be simulated by machines.
