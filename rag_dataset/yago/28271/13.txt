Guy Ritchie, who famously helped turn books about an English detective whose weapons were logic and reason into a movie franchise about fistfights, bromance, and explosions, has been hired to do similar with the gloriously public-domain pirate classic, Treasure Island. God I hope Taylor Lautner plays Jim Hawkins.

Warner Bros has attached Guy Ritchie to direct a new version of Robert Louis Stevenson’s pirate tale Treasure Island, and has set Alex Harakis to write the script. Ritchie will produce the film with his partner Lionel Wigram and Langley Park’s Kevin McCormick. It was Wigram who originally set up a stylized version of the classic novel, much the way he did Sherlock Holmes, which Ritchie directed. [Deadline]
