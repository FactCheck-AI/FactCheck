In the spring of 1795, Napoleon Bonaparte went to Paris, hoping to obtain a satisfactory command. No offers came, and Napoleon considered providing his services to the Ottoman sultan in Constantinople. That same year he met the widow Jos√©phine de Beauharnais. After their wedding one year later, Napoleon began his Italian campaign and Josephine began her affair with a Hussar lieutenant. They remained married throughout his own numerous affairs and his coronation as emperor of France in 1804. He had the marriage annulled in 1810 because she failed to provide him with an heir.
