Quentin Tarantino has long maintained that his success as a writer and director stems in large part from his encyclopedic knowledge of film and an adolescence spent absorbing as many frames of it as he possibly could. Â

But Tarantino was also an avid consumer of television. While he was editing 1994âs Pulp Fiction, he would come home, collapse on his sofa, and watch The X-Files and Home Improvement. When he was hoping to cast John Travolta in 1996âs vampire drama From Dusk Till Dawn, he invited the actor over to his house and played the Welcome Back, Kotter board game with him.

Travolta ultimately ended up in Pulp Fiction; George Clooney, who had broken his losing streak of canceled TV shows in the fall of 1994 with NBCâs hospital drama ER, wound up taking a role alongside Tarantino in From Dusk Till Dawn (which Tarantino wrote and Robert Rodriguez directed). Thatâs when the actor proposed that Tarantino consider directing an episode of the hit series.

âMotherhood,â the penultimate episode of ERâs first season, aired on May 11, 1995. Written by Lydia Woodward, the showâs intertwined plots were all related to the titleâs theme and given a copious amount of screen blood to mesh with Tarantinoâs reputation for unsettling imagery. A boy is wheeled in after a playground mishap with a rod poking through his chest (itâs removed, slowly, with help from a bone saw); a gang memberâs ear is lopped off; a drug overdose leads to foaming at the mouth. Woodward says she didnât really write the episode with Tarantino in mind, though she did try to âgross outâ the medical procedures.

Accustomed to having the final word on film sets, Tarantino told an interviewer he initially found it off-putting that ER executive producer John Wells told him he needed to shoot more footage for a scene he thought he had completed. âThen I realized, this is their show, this isnât my show,â he said. âIn TV, the producer is the man, the auteur.â
