Hi Grognard,

Thanks for looking in. I'm finally repainting this piece after more than 30 odd years!

First bought from Historex Agents, the title was Louis XI and Marie de Provence.

Actually I checked on the web. Louis XI was married to Margaret Stewart and then Charlotte Savoy. None of them are shown in the dress as depicted in this piece!

The closest image I found was a Mokarex piece of Charlotte Savoy in this dress. I suspect that Le Cimier used this as their reference.

The closest dress to this was worn by Anne Beaujeu, Louis XI's daughter. So I am repainting them as a father and daughter pair.

You are right, here some illustrations of Charlotte de Savoie
