On July 20, 2015, actor and devoted Christian Kirk Cameron and his wife Chelsea Noble celebrated their 24th wedding anniversary. The simple dinner celebration together with their six wonderful children was held at home. And Kirk is proud to share on Facebook their old wedding photograph.

In his Facebook post, Kirk was thankful and happy to note that “To me, still being together and in love is the best gift of all. God has been so kind and given me so much more than I deserve.” To this date, his post has already received more than 2 million likes. Several individuals have also greeted him and shared their own love stories.

One of those who have made a comment says that the secret to their enduring relationship is their Christian conviction and the presence of God in their daily lives. Another popular comment said that when a man loves a woman similar to how he loves God, he will enjoy a life of peace and love.

This coming September, Kirk Cameron will be one of the guests speakers of the major Christian event “Love Worth Fighting For” which is focused on marriage. Based on the event’s theme, God’s relationship with the church and its members is often depicted in the forms of “father”, “husband”, “wife”, and “child”. And the best manifestation of God’s unconditional love is the love that you give to your children and spouse.
