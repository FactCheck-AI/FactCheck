Jeremy Sisto and his wife Addie Lane are expecting a second child.

The Suburgatory actor announced that his wife is pregnant during an appearance on The Talk earlier this week.

He revealed: "It's a boy!"

Sisto and his wife tied the knot in October 2009, a few months after Lane gave birth to the couple's daughter Charlie Ballerina.

He was previously married to Marisa Ryan for several years in the 1990s.

It was recently announced that Sisto will reunite with his Clueless co-star Alicia Silverstone for an episode of his sitcom Suburgatory.

Suburgatory airs Wednesdays at 8.30/7.30c on ABC.
