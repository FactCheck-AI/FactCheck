The intoduction of Carla into the world of Verbotene Liebe

Carla Sophia von Lahnstein respects the wish of her father Johannes Gustav Friedrich von Lahnstein (the head of the aristocratic family "von Lahnstein") and returns home to Königsbrunn, the family castle, after having spent many years abroad.

As an expert in the history of art she has worked all over the world and becomes the head of the family's auction house. She immediately begins an affair with her assistant Evelyn.

Her love of women is a well-kept secret not only to the public, but especially to her father. She fears that he would reject her, should he ever find out about it.

Her upbringing and playing hide-and-seek for years has taught her self-control and reserve and that is probably why she often comes across as arrogant.

After a lot of back and forth with Hanna the two of them finally get together. They both have a hard time because they have to hide their love for one another. There are many situations when they are very close to being detected. That is why the number of people who know about them becomes bigger and bigger and it can only be a matter of time until Carla's father will find out...

Castle Königsbrunn

The real name from the Castle in the soap

Verbotene Liebe is Castle Ehreshoven

and is iving in Germany -near the city Köln-

The castle, first mentioned in 1355, was in possession of the Count von Nesselrode for more than 500 years, and was bequeathed by the last countess of the house to the "Rheinische Ritterschaft" [Rhenish Knightage] as a ladies' convent in 1920. Castle and "Vorburg" are encircled by a romantic moat and a French garden with a teahouse from the 16th century.

The object is private property, and sightseeing is not possible, and not desired, and may result in legal actions. This object is not a tourist destination, it is privately used. Therefore please refrain from a visit, as this would be seen as a disruption of privacy by the residents in most cases. Should a publication on this website lead to an harassment of the residents, I will no longer publish such entries here.

is Carlotte, Maria Galdi?

Zitat:

Yup. Hard to keep up isn't it? Maria is the older sister of Francesca. She had a brief affair with Johannes. When she became pregnant, Johannes married Francesca and the family sent her away. The "baby" is in question. Perhaps it is Ansgar (the eldest). That would make sense and help create the perfect soap complication. It could be Carla (though the DNA test disputes that). It could be and out-sider that could come in and claim to be the eldest heir.

I can't figure out why Maria/Carlotte/Francesca doesn't just confess to all that she is the Aunt and live with them all in the castle (except that we lose the leverage of the devious Ansgarrrrrrrrrrrr.)

AtlantaFan, have they even confirmed that Ansgar is Carlotte's/Maria Galdi's? I'm reading a lot of rumors of the way Maria looks at Carla at a different light and that maybe she is her daughter instead of Ansgar being her son. either case is fine with me though it would be better if it was Ansgar cos it would make Carla the legitimate head of LH.

learning about this I'm kind of curious now how it went when Johannes was still around. two of his sons aren't his yet he accepted them?
