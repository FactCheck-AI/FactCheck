“Rose Marie” is a 1954 American musical film adaptation of a 1924 Broadway musical. It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and filmed in the Canadian Rockies in CinemaScope. It was MGM's first US produced film in the new widescreen medium (having been preceded by the British made “Knights of the Round Table”) and the first movie musical of any studio to be released in this format.

In this adaptation of the 1924 Broadway musical, Rose Marie Lemaitre (Ann Blyth), an orphan living in the Canadian wilderness, falls in love with her guardian, Mike Malone (Howard Keel), an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The feeling is mutual. But, when she leaves to learn proper etiquette, Rose Marie meets a trapper named James Duval (Fernando Lamas), who also falls for her. Further complications arise when Native American Chief Black Eagle -- a rival of Duval's -- is murdered. [Source: Wikipedia]
