Mercure Distribution has sold Canadian rights to Cannes competition title The Officers' Ward (La Chambre Des Officiers) to Christal Films Distribution. With Cinema bagged South Korean rights.

La Chambre Des Officiers (pictured), a World War I drama adapted from a novel by Marc Dugain and written and directed by Francois Dupeyron, was produced by ARP Selection. It stars Eric Caravaca as a French officer whose face and power of speech have been destroyed by a shell and who fights a gruelling uphill battle for both moral and physical regeneration.

Sabine Azema, Andre Dussolier, Denis Podalydes and Gregori Derangere complete the cast.

Optimum Releasing recently acquired UK rights to the picture (Screendaily, Nov 11).
