Biography

Leonard Woolf was an English political theorist, author, publisher and civil servant, and husband of author Virginia Woolf.

Leonard's birth was registered in the Oct-Nov-Dec quarter of 1880 in the Kensington district, Middlesex.[1]

From 1894 to 1899 he attended St Paul's School, and in 1899 he won a classical scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge. In October 1904 Woolf moved to Ceylon to become a cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service, in Jaffna and later Kandy, and by August 1908 was named an assistant government agent in the Southern Province. He returned to England in May 1911, and married Virginia Stephen in 1912. He began writing, and published his first novel, The Village in the Jungle, based on his years in Ceylon. In 1917 the Woolfs bought a small hand-operated printing press and with it they founded the Hogarth Press – he continued as the main director of the Press until his death. His work helped to lay the foundations of the policy of the League of Nations and the United Nations and of the welfare state.
