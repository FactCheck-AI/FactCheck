These crazy kids need to get a room, am I right?!

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson have been married for 28 years. That's a long ass time!

But they've known each other even longer than that because Hanks was a fan of Wilson's since the '70s, and they met 30 years ago on set.

Well, guess what? Marriage after 28 years is still looking pretty fucking great for them.

Wilson posted the photo to her Instagram with the caption, "I love him," because the pic wasn't enough to melt our cold dead hearts.

I can't even confirm that my cat truly loves me and, yet, these two have made it work for close to three decades.

Which brings me to this conclusion: LOVE IS REAL. Especially when you've been married for this long and still post adorable AF selfies.
