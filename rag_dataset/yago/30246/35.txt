Zhao Feiyan (45 BC — 1 BC), also named Zhao Yizhu, was quite famous for her stunning beauty and excellent dancing skills in the history of China.

​

From a civilian to the queen of Emperor Cheng of Han (51 BC — 7 BC), and then the Empress Dowager respected by the Emperor Ai of Han (27 BC — 1 BC), Zhao Feiyan relied not only on her exceptional gorgeousness but also her schemes, political talent, and insight.

​

However, destiny didn’t always favor her.

A Gorgeous Dancer Who Captivated the Emperor

​

Zhao Feiyan and her sister Zhao Hede were born into a poverty civilian family, so they were sent to a princess’ mansion, where they learned to sing and dance.

​

One day, the current Emperor Cheng of Han Liu Ao came to the princess’ place and fell in love with Zhao Feiyan at first sight.

He was obsessed with her exceptional dancing skill and beauty and immediately took her back to the royal palace.

​

Later, the emperor was told that Zhao Feiyan’s younger sister, Zhao Hede, was even more beautiful. Then he welcomed Hede to his palace as soon as possible and nominated her as honored imperial consort.

​

Zhao Feiyan was very slender and beautiful and could dance in a delicate golden tray. She and her sister’s talents deeply attracted the emperor, who spent most of his free time with them.

“Romantic Rivals”

​

However, Zhao Feiyan was not satisfied, even though she already got an honorable royal title, countless treasures, and the emperor’s love and attention.

​

She and her sister started to compete with their strong “romantic enemies”.

​

Emperor Cheng of Han had a male lover named Zhang Fang, and they were indeed in love before.

After Empress Dowager Wang demoted Zhang Fang to a remote place, they kept sending each other love letters.

​

Empress Xiao Cheng Xu (? — 8 BC), the current queen of the emperor, was a beautiful, decent, highborn girl.

She married Liu Ao at a young age, and in the first ten years of their marriage, she almost got the emperor’s full attention and love.

After their little son and daughter passed away young and the queen grew older, the emperor started to like other women.

However, she was still the honored queen, let alone came from the Xu Clan (Emperor Liu Ao’s grandmother’s clan).

​

Ban Jieyu (48 BC — 2 BC) was the emperor’s favorite woman after the queen.

Besides her outstanding appearance, she was also a talented poet and literature in the history of China.

​

She never abused her power and kept persuading the emperor to care more about his empire and to stay self-disciplined and benevolent.

Hence, Empress Dowager Wang, the emperor, and officials all liked and respected Ban.

Elimination of Competitors: Zhao Feiyan's Rise in the Han Dynasty Court

Zhao Feiyan and her sister demanded that the emperor stop writing to Zhang Fang. Afterward, Zhang Fang never heard from the emperor again until his death.

​

A few months after Zhao Feiyan and her sister came to the royal palace, she reported to Empress Dowager Wang that the current queen had been implementing witchcraft to curse the Wang Clan and the emperor, and Ban Jieyu was an accomplice as well.

​

It was unclear whether Queen Xu tried to curse the Wang Clan or the Zhao sisters, but Xu did use witchcraft.

​

Hence, Xu was abolished. She tried everything to get her crown back in the next few years, including bribery; after being found out, she was forced to commit suicide.

However, Ban Jieyu defended herself excellently when the emperor inquired about her.

She insisted that if deities and ghosts are intelligent and perceptive, they won’t listen to evil people’s prayers; if they are not, then it’s even more useless to do those things.

​

The emperor was persuaded. But Ban was aware that Zhao Feiyan and her sister would do more things to attack her in the future.

​

So, Ban applied to move into Empress Dowager Wang’s palace to serve her and left the emperor to the Zhao sisters.

​

After the emperor passed away, Ban applied to guard his mausoleum until she passed away.

Queen Zhao Feiyan and Her Reign in the Royal Palace

​

After those romantic rivals were gone, Zhao Feiyan told the emperor she wanted to be the queen.

​

However, Empress Dowager Wang disagreed since Zhao came from an ordinary family.

​

Hence, Zhao Feiyan bribed Empress Dowager Wang’s nephew, who could speak good things for her.

​

Then, the emperor awarded Zhao’s father a high rank, noble title. Two months later, he finally nominated the “highborn” Zhao Feiyan as his queen and promoted her sister Zhao Hede.

​

Feiyan and Hede had no babies during more than ten years of their being with the emperor; other imperial concubines didn’t have any live kids either.

​

Some believed Hede, maybe Feiyan herself included, killed two babies of the emperor.

Queen Zhao Feiyan's Political Investment

​

When the emperor got older but childless, many officials started suggesting he adopt a boy from another royal clan as the heir.

​

Zhao Feiyan seized this opportunity and recommended Liu Xin, the emperor's nephew, who played an essential role in making him the crown prince.

​

One year after the heir was settled, Emperor Liu Ao suddenly died in Zhao Hede's bed.

​

Liu Ao had been strong and healthy; hence, his sudden death aroused suspicions and critics against Hede.

Most people believed that she seduced the emperor to eat or do something unusual, which led to his departure.

​

Then, Zhao Hede knew she had no choice and committed suicide.

Posthumous Reputation in History and Literature

​

After Zhao Feiyan's death, her former political enemy, the Wang Clan, criticized her and her sister Zhao Hede for seducing Emperor Liu Ao, having killed the emperor's babies, and being involved in political issues that jeopardized the Han Empire's reign.

​

Zhao Feiyan seduced her husband, implemented schemes to get herself the queen's crown, and recommended Liu Xin, a qualified emperor, to the Han Empire.

​

But there's no concrete evidence for the rest of the crimes that people accused her of.

​

However, ironically, about a decade later, the righteous regent Wang Mang usurped the throne, ended the Han Dynasty and established his new empire.

​

Gradually, more gossip and stories of the Zhao sisters were made up in novels, including that they cheated on the emperor, faked pregnancy, stole a baby from out of the royal palace, and how they used pills to stay beautiful and allure, etc.

​

The truth probably will be buried in history forever. But without a doubt, Zhao Feiyan was stunningly beautiful, exceptionally great at dancing, and quite intelligent and decisive in seizing opportunities to get what she wanted.
