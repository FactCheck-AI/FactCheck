Friends,

Kiraly Salomon, Salomon I, King of Hungary, per ES married Judith/Sophie v.

Schwaben, daughter of Kaiser Heinrich III and had two daughters before he

died. Judith Sophie married (2) Wladyslaw I, Wladyslaw Herman Polski. The

second daughter of Salomon by Sophie was reportedly the Sophie v. Ungarn who

married Poppo v. Berg Schelklingen (again from ES). Given the need for

politically advantageous marriages, the step-daughter of Wladyslaw married

to Poppo is somewhat puzzling. Who was he? What family or other ties gave

Poppo station to marry this princess? Does anyone have his pedigree?

Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.
