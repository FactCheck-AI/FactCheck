Actress Born Marjorie Fisher on Dec. 18, 1915 in Roanoke, VA

Lynn Bari was a husky-voiced siren who starred in dozens of films in the 1930s and '40s, usually as "the other woman" in low-budget pictures for 20th Century Fox. She came to pictures as a youthful chorine after moving to Los Angeles with her minister-stepfather from Boston, where she was raised.

Statuesque and darkly beautiful, she was first seen in "Dancing Lady," a 1933 musical in which a young Broadway dancer named Fred Astaire also made his film debut.

She was born Marjorie Fisher in Roanoke, Va., but after taking acting lessons here she changed her name. She said in a long-ago interview she had devised "Lynn Bari" by combining the names of actress Lynn Fontanne and author Sir James M. Barrie.

Her second husband, Sid Luft, later married Judy Garland.
