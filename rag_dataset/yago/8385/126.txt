The story was good ( inspired by real-life story of Julia Pastrana ) but the directing style of Marco Ferreri is even more amazing. Film even has two versions of it, a "Happy Ending" version was made for the Cannes Film Festival as that was more acceptable and then the original version which is much more darker and sad. For now I watched the original version and I must say it really moved me.

Basically it's a film with only two actors in the forefront. Ugo Tognazzi as Antonio Focaccia and Annie Girardot as Maria. Maria has a condition that has her completely covered in hair, thus everyone calling her an "Ape Woman". Antonio discovers her working in the kitchen…

Marco Ferreri directs a 94 minute dramedy starring Ugo Tognazzi and Annie Girardot, the plot focuses on a man who takes on a woman with a rare genetic condition and persuades her into doing shows for him.

There's definitely comedy to be found in Ape woman, such as the bit where those guys are watching the pictures from Africa, or the first performance he gets her to do, or the nun overeacting, an arguement they have later on involving parenthood or the bit after he meets the baron.

And like the wedding scene and ending (s) what I mentioned is confrontational.

But this is also a bleak film, its Ferreri's Nazarin, Girardot earns every trace of your empathy, Tognazzi plays…
