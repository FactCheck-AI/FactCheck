Lithuanian filmmaker Sarunas Bartas made films that were increasingly visual, contemplative and meditative with little or no dialogue: the hermetic Trys Dienos/ Three Days (1991), photographed by Vladas Naudius and starring Yekaterina Golubeva, Koridorius/ The Corridor (1995), the ethnographic journey Musu Nedaug/ Few of Us (1996), filmed by Bartas himself and starring again Yekaterina Golubeva, and the visual poem Namai/ The House (1997).
