Born in Siauliau, Lithuania, in 1964, Sharunas Bartas graduated from the famous VGIK Film School in Moscow and in 1989 founded the first independent studio in Lithuania, Studija Kinema. He was very well received by the critics early on and with his films Three Days (1991), The Corridor (1995), Few of Us (1996) and Peace to Us in Our Dreams (2015) he built an uncommonly delicate aesthetic, which he continues to expand in his work. In February 2016, he was celebrated by the Centre Pompidou through a retrospective dedicated to his work. As a frequent guest of LEFFEST - Lisbon & Sintra Film Festival, he returns once more to this year's 14th edition with his most recent feature In The Dusk (2020), selected in the festivalâ€™s competition.
