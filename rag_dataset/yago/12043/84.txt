Sharunas Bartas, born in 1964, is the author of eight films, selected for all the major festivals and celebrated by the critics. Since his first feature-length film Three Days (1991), he has created a dense and personal filmography marked by a fascination for people in remote geographies, for vagrants or roamers and their environments, be they splendid or desolate. He has set his films in sites at once forgotten and powerfully evocative, such as the valleys of southwest Siberia (Few of Us), Kaliningrad (Three Days), the Lithuanian forests (The House), the Sahara of southern Morocco (Freedom) or the Crimean countryside (Seven Invisible Men). Trained as cinematographer at Moscow`s renowned VGIK, Sharunas Bartas acts as his own cameraman. From the beginning, he has regularly used still photography as an integral part of the preparation of his films.
