22/04/2015 - The Lithuanian film is set to represent the Baltics at Cannes

Peace to Us in Our Dreams , by acclaimed Lithuanian director Šarūnas Bartas, has been selected for the Directors’ Fortnight section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it will have its world premiere.

The selection continues Bartas’ long and varied history with Cannes. His films Few of Us and The House screened in Un Certain Regard in 1996 and 1997, respectively, while – ten years ago – his film Seven Invisible Men also screened in the Directors’ Fortnight.

Peace to Us in Our Dreams is a story about a man who comes to a village for a weekend with his teenage daughter and a girlfriend. The relationship between the man and his young friend is complicated. The 16-year-old daughter has a hard time dealing with the adults’ relationship crisis, and she therefore feels lonely and estranged. Since her childhood, she has been friendly with a boy from the village while spending her days in a summer house. But one day, a boy steals a rifle from the local hunters, and then the troubles and the drama really begin.
