IFC is speaking “AMERICANese,” scooping up North American rights to the Hamptons Film Festival pic for its First Take label.

Movie is based on Shawn Wong’s novel about Asian-American identity, “American Knees,” which centers on the relationships between Chinese-American Raymond Ding and a number of his paramours.

Film, directed by Eric Byler (“Charlotte Sometimes”), won the audience award for narrative feature and the jury prize for ensemble acting at this year’s South by Southwest Film Festival. Movie also screened at Hamptons Film Festival this month.

“AMERICANese” stars a number of well-known Asian-American actors, including Chris Tashima (“Visas and Virtue”) as the main character as well as Joan Chen (“The Last Emperor”). Company is planning a 2007 release.

First Take movies are released simultaneously in theaters and on-demand for Comcast and Cablevision subs. IFC and Cablevision are sister companies. About 24 films are released annually on First Take.
