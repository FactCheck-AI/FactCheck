In Spanish with English subtitles. Also known as A Woman in Love.

Enamorada, Mexican filmmaker Emilio Fernandez' only 1946 effort, was released in the US early the following year. The film's English-language title is A Woman in Love, the girl in question being the ravishing Maria Felix. Set during the Mexican revolution, the story concerns the rocky relationship between the high-born Beatriz (Felix) and revolutionary General Reyes (Pedro Armendariz). Forsworn to kill and/or humiliate any aristocrats in his path, Reyes cannot bring himself to harm Beatriz, whose hatred for the general slowly but surely turns to love. Throughout, Maria Felix is stunningly photographed by Gabriel Figueroa, one of director Fernandez' favorite collaborators.
