In her most successful film at the box office, Norma Shearer finally got the chance to prove to the world that she was indeed, an actress. She faced a lot of criticism throughout the early stages of her career because many thought she lacked talent and only rose to the top due to her marriage to MGM Vice President Irving Thalberg. Shearer was thrilled to be nominated for Best Actress at the Academy Awards for her role in “The Barretts of Wimpole Street”(1934) knowing it would quiet her critics for the last time. In the film she wears the incredible Poet Ring jewelry.
