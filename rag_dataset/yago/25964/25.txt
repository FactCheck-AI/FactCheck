Pierce Brosnan and his wife are soaking up the sun!

The former James Bond actor and Keely Shaye Smith were spotted taking a dip on Hawaii over the weekend, and they're definitely keeping the spark alive in their 17-year marriage.

The 64-year-old actor went shirtless as he dried himself off while wearing a pair of light blue swim trunks, while his wife, 54, flaunted her curves in a chic navy one-piece suit. You can see the photos in the video above.

This isn't the first time the couple has been spotted on the beach together recently. Last year, Brosnan and Smith were photographed packing on the PDA during their Italian beach vacation.

The couple got married in August of 2001 and met in Mexico in 1994. They share two sons: Dylan, 21, and Paris, 17.
