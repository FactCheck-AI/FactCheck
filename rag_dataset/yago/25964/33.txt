Smith also shared the love on social media, posting three throwback photos to her Instagram account, of their 2001 wedding. The pair tied the knot in Ashford Castle in Co Mayo. Smith wrote a touching caption to accompany the photos.

It read: "You are the finest, loveliest, tenderest person I have ever known. Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together. May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flies on love’s wings."

The couple met in 1994 when Brosnan was at the height of his Bond fame. In April, Smith shared another post and a memory of their first encounter. She wrote: "Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later."

Brosnan, 71, and Smith, 60, share two sons together, Dylan and Paris. Brosnan has one biological son and two adopted children from his previous marriage to Cassandra Harris, who passed away from ovarian cancer in 1991.
