"Happy Anniversary my love @piercebrosnanofficial. Here’s to the next 23 years together.

"May they continue to be creative, adventurous, loving, inspiring, and joyful. Time flies on love’s wings."

In the first photo, Brosnan can be seen dressed in a tuxedo, white waistcoat and silver tie while Smith is in a white gown with lace sleeves paired with a long veil.

Pierce also paid tribute to his wife, captioning a series of pictures: "Happy 23rd anniversary my darling Keely, my beautiful brown eyes girl, my north, my south, my east and west.

"All my love, should I fall behind, wait for me," he wrote.

The couple, who share two sons together, Dylan and Paris, met in 1994.

In April, Smith, 60, recounted when they met and said in a social media post: "Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later."

James Bond star Brosnan, 71, was previously married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris and they had one son together, Sean.

The actor also adopted Harris’ children Charlotte and Chris after he married their mother. Cassandra died from ovarian cancer in 1991 and Charlotte died of the same disease in 2013.
