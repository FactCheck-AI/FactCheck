Robin Williams is ready to dig his old dress out of storage, as he’s set to star in “Mrs. Doubtfire 2,” an individual familiar with the Fox 2000 sequel told TheWrap.

Chris Columbus will return to direct from a script by “Elf” writer David Berenbaum.

While it has been more than 20 years since the original “Mrs. Doubtfire” grossed an impressive $441 million worldwide, it’s unlikely Williams would miss a beat reprising his role as the cross-dressing character, since he’ll be slathered in old-age makeup anyway, along with a wig, fake teeth and eyeglasses. The gifted comic actor could realistically play the beloved character for years to come.

In “Mrs. Doubtfire,” Williams played a down-on-his-luck actor still stinging from a divorce who pretends to be a Scottish nanny in order to spend more time with his kids. Sally Field and Pierce Brosnan co-starred.

The movie was a huge hit and while a sequel was put in development with Bonnie Hunt writing the script, the movie never materialized and the project has been considered inactive for years.

Fox 2000’s Elizabeth Gabler and Marisa Paiva will oversee the project for the studio.

Williams, who can currently be seen on CBS’ sitcom “The Crazy Ones,” next stars in “The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,” which hits theaters in May. Columbus is currently in pre-production on Sony’s Adam Sandler movie “Pixels.”

Williams, Columbus and Berenbaum are repped by WME.
