According to the inscription on this small portrait, it is a likeness of Catherine de’ Medici (1519–1589), queen of France. Orphaned at a young age, when she was fourteen she was married to Henry (1519–1559), second son of King Francis I of France. Henry became heir to the throne when his older brother died in 1536; he was crowned King Henry II in 1547. The marriage between Henry and Catherine, arranged for dynastic purposes, resulted in them having thirteen children together: three of their sons were later kings of France, and two of their daughters became queens consort. This portrait of Catherine as a young girl was painted in the 1530s, probably by a master at the court in Fontainebleau who had studied in Italy. The inscription describing the sitter as the “queen mother” is clearly a later addition.
