Mean Girls star Erika Henningsen has joined the cast of Tina Fey's upcoming Netflix series The Four Seasons, Variety reports. The show is set to begin production later this year, with a cast that also includes Fey, Steve Carell, and Colman Domingo.

The Four Seasons is based on Alan Alda's 1981 film of the same name, starring Alda, Carol Burnett, Len Cariou, and Rita Moreno, among others. The movie follows three married couples who go on quarterly vacations together, but the group dynamic is threatened when one of the husbands takes interest in a younger woman. Fey co-created the show with Lang Fisher and Tracey Wigfield, and all three are executive producing.

Henningsen and Fey have collaborated in the past, with Henningsen originating the role of Cady Heron in Broadway's Mean Girls musical adaptation. Henningsen also appears in a recurring role in Girls5Eva, a musical comedy series which Fey executive produces.
