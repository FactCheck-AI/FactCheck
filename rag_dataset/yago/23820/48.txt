By 1955 Clouzot was established as the director of classic noirish thrillers such as Wages of Fear (1952) and Les Diaboliques (1954). That summer, however, he spent eight hours a day at Pablo Picasso’s studio in Nice filming his friend at work and creating what was described by a critic as “the most beautiful suspense film ever made.” The most intense and captivating sequences were created by filming the reverse side of transparent or semi-transparent surfaces as Picasso painted on them. Willsdon introduces the film (1956, 78 min.), whose title means “the Picasso mystery,” and leads a post-screening discussion.
