***25th Anniversary***

Robin Williams stars in one of the biggest comedies of the 1990s! After a bitter divorce, struggling actor Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) disguises himself as a British nanny so he can care for his children, and hopefully reconnect with his estranged wife Miranda (Sally Field). A hilarious and heartfelt family comedy, MRS. DOUBTFIRE was the second highest-grossing films of 1993 (behind only JURASSIC PARK), and deservedly won the Academy Award for Best Makeup.
