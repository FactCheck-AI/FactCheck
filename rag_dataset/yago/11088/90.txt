Biography

American actress who worked on stage, radio, film, and television, in a career that spanned nearly six decades. She made her film debut in 1929. Her first film roles were negligible and she headed for Broadway in 1930, quickly rising from small parts to leading roles. In 1933, she returned to Hollywood under contract to Columbia, this time under her stage name of Ann Sothern. After ten years in B pictures, she became a hit in the persona of a lighthearted heroine in a series of ten films, "Maisie," where MGM put her talents to good use as a bouncy, scatterbrained blonde.

Sothern was not entirely fluff; she showed dramatic talent in "Cry Havoc," 1943 and "Letter to Three Wives," 1949. She starred in her own TV series, "Private Secretary," 1953-1957, followed by "The Ann Sothern Show," 1957-1961. She received an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress in "The Whales of August," 1987.

She was married twice; to actors Roger Pryer, 1936-1942 and to Robert Sterling, 1943-1949. Their daughter, Tisha Sterling, born 10 December 1944, is an actress.

She died at 92, on 18 March 2001 of heart failure at her home in Ketchum, Idaho.

Source Notes

Stephen Przybylowski quotes B.C. 5/2001. The time may be read clearly for 11: but the minutes are obscured on the B.C. and could be anything from one to ten, nor is there any AM or PM designated: AM is an assumption.

(Formerly, Penfield Collection gave January 22, 1909, 20:00 CST, Bismarck, ND with the quote," Date verified, time from SS which gave 1915 as her birth year." The data is not in SS.)
