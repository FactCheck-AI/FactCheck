Best-selling comic book artist Joann Sfar delivers a fascinating biography of famed French singer Serge Gainsbourg with his impressive debut Gainsbourg, Je t'Aime... Moi Non Plus. Born Lucien Ginsburg to Russian-Jewish parents, Gainsbourg was lastingly impacted by his childhood in Nazi-occupied France. Sfar gives a glimpse to what is to come by introducing a massive anti-Semitic caricature puppet that chases the young Gainsbourg through the street. From there, Sfar depicts Gainsbourg's rise to fame and his proclivity to drinking and women—including his affair with Brigitte Bardot (perfectly cast Laetitia Casta) and marriage to Jane Birkin (Lucy Gordon).

Creating anything but a basic biopic, Sfar envelopes Gainsbourg's story with a unique and surrealistic style, incorporating such devices as puppets and cartoons to punctuate the incredible life of the man that gave the world songs such as "Bonnie and Clyde" and the scandalous "Je t'aime… moi non plus." Sfar's fantastical elements and sumptuous cinematography by Guillaume Schiffman give an added dimension to Gainsbourg's turbulent life, and Eric Elmosnino's uncanny resemblance and immersive performance may make you forget you're not watching Gainsbourg himself.
