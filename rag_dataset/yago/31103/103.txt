On September 3, 1785, Charlotte married Friedrich, then the Duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen, and took up residence at Schloss Hildburghausen.

Despite her husband’s disinterest, Charlotte became much loved by the people of Saxe-Hildburghausen. She gave very generously to causes and charities that helped the poor and funded numerous programs that provided education and training to the less fortunate. Charlotte also supported the arts and brought many musicians and artists to court. She also became known as one of the best singers of her time. Having taken lessons as a girl in Hanover, the Duchess often sang in both court and church events.

Eight years before her husband became Duke of Saxe-Altenburg, Charlotte died after a long illness in Hildburghausen, Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany on May 14, 1818. Per her wishes, she was to be buried in the new city cemetery (Stadtfriedhof) in Hildburghausen. She was initially buried in the Hildburghausen Castle Church in the Duchy of Saxe-Hildburghausen, now in Thuringia, Germany. Her remains were moved to the Hildburghausen Stadtfriedhof in 1819, the first burial in the new cemetery. Her tomb, a large bronzed pillar atop what is known as the Ducal Mound, was completed in 1824. The mound is now also the burial site of several of the previous Dukes of Saxe-Hildburghausen and their wives. Other members of the Saxe-Altenburg family are buried elsewhere in the cemetery.
