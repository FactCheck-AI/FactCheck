What happened to Greg Wise's sister?

Greg revealed he was dedicating his Strictly appearance to his late sister.

In February 2018 he revealed how 51-year-old Clare died of cancer just hours after he urged her to "let go".

He also revealed that he nursed her through the disease in 2016, accompanying her to hospital appointments, and even helping her to shower as she worsened.
