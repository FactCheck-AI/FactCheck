Strictly Come Dancing star Greg Wise married actress Emma Thompson in 2003 but their relationship might not have occurred without the influence of Kate Winslet.

Greg, Emma, and Reading -born actress Kate all starred in the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility and at the time Emma was married to Shakespearean actor, Kenneth Branagh.

Whilst on the Graham Norton show Emma explained how she and Greg ended up together.

She said: "Before he did the job, he went to see a friend of his who was a bit witchy and she said he would meet his future partner on the film."

"He assumed it wasn't me because I was married and quite a lot older than him so he thought it might be Kate."

"He took her to Glastonbury, and she was so bored, and he thought, 'This isn't going to work, who can it be?"

Greg later realised that Emma was the one for him when Kate pointed out the fantastic chemistry that they shared.

Greg explained to the Express: "She pointed out that we were right for each other and told me that Emmaâ€™s marriage was over."

Emma and Greg were married in 2003 and Kate has been married to her third husband Edward Abel Smith since 2012.

Kate recently won an Emmy for hit show Mare of Easttown and expressed gratitude for her husband in her list of people to thank, when she said: "And my husband Ned who I get to hold hands with for the rest of my life."
