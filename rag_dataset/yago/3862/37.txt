CNN host Christiane Amanpour and husband Jamie Rubin are divorcing after 20 years of marriage, Page Six can confirm.

The golden couple, who have a teenage son, wed in Italy in 1998 after finding romance in war-torn Sarajevo. But a source tells us: “The are still really good friends.”

The Washington Post first reported on the split.

Christiane, 60, the host of CNN’s global affairs show “Amanpour,” lives in London and recently took over Charlie Rose’s slot after the anchorman was accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women.

Jamie, 58, a former journalist and Bill Clinton-era assistant secretary of state for public affairs, recently moved to Washington, where he is writing and consulting for lobbying firm Ballard Partners.

Christiane called Jamie a “true hero” while talking to Oprah Winfrey, and told her how he moved to London to be with her and care for their son Darius, saying: “Jamie is the poster child for good husbands.”

Their swanky wedding was attended by John F. Kennedy Jr. and wife Carolyn, diplomat Richard Holbrooke, Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal and former Deputy National Security Adviser James Steinberg.
