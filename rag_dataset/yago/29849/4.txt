Fernando I (November 27, 1380 – April 2, 1416) was King of Aragon, Valencia, Majorca, Sardinia and (nominal) Corsica and King of Sicily, Duke (nominal) of Athens and Neopatria, and Count of Barcelona, Roussillon and Cerdanya (1412–1416). He was also Regent of Castile (1406–1416).

Infante Fernando was born November 27, 1380 in Medina del Campo, the younger son of King Juan I of Castile and Infanta Eleanor of Aragon, daughter of King Pedro IV of Aragon and his wife Eleanor of Sicily, the daughter of Peter II of Sicily and Elisabeth of Carinthia. She was the second of eight children, six of whom survived to adulthood.

On August 15, 1403 in Medina del Campo, Infante Fernando founded a new order of knighthood, the Order of the Jar.

In 1406, upon the death of his elder brother, King Enrique III of Castile, Infante Fernando declined the Castilian crown and instead, with Enrique III’s widow Catherine of Lancaster, became coregent during the minority of his nephew King Juan II of Castile. In this capacity he distinguished himself by his prudent administration of domestic affairs.

In a war with the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, he conquered the town of Antequera (1410), whence his surname.

After Fernando’s maternal uncle, King Martin I of Aragon (King Martin II of Sicily), died without surviving legitimate issue, Infante Fernando was chosen King of Aragon in 1412 to succeed him in the Compromise of Caspe. The other candidate, Count James II of Urgell, revolted and King Fernando dissolved the County of Urgell in 1413.

King Fernando created the title of Prince of Girona for the heir of the Crown of Aragon on February 19, 1416.

The most notable accomplishment of his brief reign was his agreement in 1416 to depose the Anti-Pope Benedict XIII, thereby helping to end the Western Schism, which had divided the Roman Catholic Church for nearly 40 years.

He is buried in the Crown of Aragon’s royal pantheon of the monastery of Poblet, in a magnificent tomb ordered by his son Alfonso to Pere Oller in 1417.
