Pepito, despite the advice of Susanna a saloon girl, who has fallen in love with him, plays roulette which Fred has rigged and takes away all his money, becoming the 'Richest Man in Golden City. Pepito writes to Carmen to come and in fact, she comes a few days later, accompanied by Fred and his men. Pepito the naive but grateful, welcomes Fred, but on his wedding day discovers that Carmen and Fred have made an agreement to rob him and then flee. With a ploy Pepito disarms the Fredâ€™s gang, then fights with Fred and wins. Carmen, Fred and his gang are kicked out of Golden City while Pepito marries Susanna.
