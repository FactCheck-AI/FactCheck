If director Rob Marshall's 2005 endeavor "Memoirs of a Geisha" was too frilly for your liking, may I boldly suggest an alternative. Noboru Iguchi's "RoboGeisha," powered by the team responsible for "The Machine Girl" and "Tokyo Gore Police," looks positively insane, even by my standards Flesh-eating breast milk, deadly fried shrimp, breast cannons, hip swords, and a plethora of other visual insanities await those brave enough to dive face-first into this remarkably silly picture. Not much information is currently flowing through the web, but we've got a trailer that's ready for your consumption.

It probably goes without saying that this isn't safe for work, so please view with caution. I'd hate to be the reason you got fired today.
