Hanna Schygulla plays a nymphomaniac and neurotic mother who still feels young. She destroys her family by plunging headlong into countless affairs and ends up in a psychiatric clinic. Her husband loses first his mind, then his life. Their daughter Piera is a precocious Lolita who is incapable of finding emotional fulfilment until she is well into adulthood and has embarked on a career as a stage actor. Hanna Schygulla received the Award for Best Female Actor at the Cannes film festival for her performance.
