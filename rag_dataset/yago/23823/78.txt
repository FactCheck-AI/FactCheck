Henri-Georges Clouzot's (The Wages of Fear, Les Diaboliques) Le Corbeau is a brilliant tale of provincial pettiness and betrayal. The inhabitants of a small town in France have had their lives upended by an outbreak of anonymous poison pen letters, sent by someone calling themselves “Le Corbeau” (the Raven). The accusations began with infidelity and theft, but grow more dramatic as they eventually encompass almost the entire population— strangely centring around one Dr. Germain. When a man is driven to suicide, suspicion and recriminations run wild as the upright citizens turn on each other in their desperation to unmask the Raven.

Clouzot really kicked a hornet's nest with this provocative little fable, considered by some to be the first French modern film noir. It was pulled from cinemas only three weeks after its release during the Nazi occupation of France—too reminiscent of antisemitic witch-hunts for the Vichy regime—while after the war he was viewed as a collaborator, banned from directing for life by the Comité de Libération du Cinéma. They would eventually relent, and Le Corbeau found a new wave of appreciative audiences for its atmospheric sense of paranoia and powerful indictment of mob mentality.
