'Le Corbeau' Director: Henri-Georges Clouzot (1943) French/English subtitles

A dark study of human nature from a master filmmaker. In rural France anonymous poison-pen letters appear -first denouncing the 'outsider' local doctor but soon taking in other prominent members of society. Paranoia and mistrust soon engulf the town. Condemned upon release by the church and political classes but now considered a classic.
