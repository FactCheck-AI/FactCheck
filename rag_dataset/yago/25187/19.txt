GUADALAJARA, Mexico — Latin soap opera actress Michelle Vieth is the latest celebrity to pop up on the Internet with a sex video.

The 25-year-old actress stars in a honeymoon sex video, which surfaced on the web following a divorce. The video, she says, is nearly five years old, and includes actor and former husband Hector Soberón, who reportedly released it.

Soberón continues to star with Vieth in “Clase 406,” a Spanish “novella.”

The video surfaced on a number of Mexican websites in the last week after Vieth was voted off Mexican celebrity show, “Big Brother VIP.”

The sex tape, called “Big Brother Motel VIP,” was profiled this week on Mexican TV’s “El Eye del Huracan” and in the magazine TVyNovelas.

According to web portal company Terra Lycos, Vieth was the third most popular user search term for the last week of July, following Paris Hilton and Clay Aiken.

This year, Vieth joins actresses Severina Vuckovic, Cameron Diaz and “Survivor” star Jenna Lewis as celebrities whose sex videos have been broadcast over the Internet.

Vieth, known best throughout Mexico for her wholesome demeanor, was 20 years old when the video was shot. The Marshalltown, Iowa-born actress moved to Acapulco with her family when she was three.

Vieth, who also models and stars in novella "Amigas y Rivales," was 16 when she debuted on TV in novellas like “Mi Traviesa,” "Soñadoras," “Mi Pequeña Traviesa.” She also has been featured on the “Christina” show, which is shown in the United States, and she just finished her second appearance on “Big Brother VIP.”
