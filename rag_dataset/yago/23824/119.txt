“You’ve got ink on your fingers” may be one of the most chilling lines in this German production by the Director of

Les Diaboliques (1955) and The Wages of Fear (1953). Terrifying rumors, vicious gossip, Nazi-like authorities, and mob mentality run rampant make Henri-Georges Clouzot’s work timeless in our era of bullying — by “townspeople” and politicians alike — on social media. Because it was produced by a German company during the French Occupation, Le Corbeau was considered Collaborationist by the French film industry.

Clouzot’s film both resonates with the “wartime hypocrisy” it intended, and takes on new, urgent meaning about human nature in these trying times.
