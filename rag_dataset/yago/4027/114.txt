Returning from the Vietnam War brings emotional upheaval to even the most idealistic families. Keeping up appearances is foremost in the Collier family, creating THE WAR AT HOME. Having recently returned from the war as an honored vet, Jeremy notices a turning point for all his family members during this Thanksgiving celebration. Jeremy is not the same person he was when he left for the war. He has returned with memories which haunt his inmost being. His family has no frame of reference to understand what he has experienced, and invariably they attempt to placate him. Dumped by his girlfriend, Jeremy spins into a deeper into his world of self pity.

Director Emilio Estevez addresses flaws in the fabric of families. THE WAR AT HOME responds to what many Vietnam vets experienced upon their return. The film is agonizing. It shows how so much bitterness and hatred can be pent up in one individual for so long. The unregenerate nature of the film exposes the need for forgiveness to receive liberation from the past. Although pity is felt for the antagonist, fault is found with each character. Each party has contributing flaws. Filled with angst, obscenities, images of war, and horror, it is a powerful and disturbing film.
