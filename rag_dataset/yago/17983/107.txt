Meet the two new mechanical enhanced sisters who replace their missing anatomy with high-powered automatic weaponry the same way some people collect tattoos!

Beware the wrath of two battle-busting sisters bent on vengeance!

Rise of the Machine Girls stars Himena Tsukimiya (Red Blade), Kanon Hanakage (Nowhere Girl) and *drum roll* cult martial arts star Tak Sakaguchi (Re:Born, Versus).
