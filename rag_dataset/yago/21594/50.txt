Well-known Chinese writer, literary translator and foreign literature researcher Yang Jiang died at the age of 105 in Beijing on Wednesday morning.

Yang, the wife of late Chinese novelist Qian Zhongshu, enjoyed decades of fame across the country for her literature works such as Six Chapters from My Life 'Downunder'(1981), Baptism(1988), and We Three(2004), which recalls her husband and her daughter Qian Yuan (1937â1997), who died of cancer one year before her father's death. Her translation of the Spanish novel Don Quixote de la Mancha is widely considered the best Chinese version.

Yang Jiang, whose original name was Yang Ji Kang, married Qian Zhongshu, one of the top Chinese litterateurs, in 1935.
