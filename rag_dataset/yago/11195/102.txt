Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, also known as just Ninja Turtles or TMNT, is a multimedia franchise created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in November 1983. The title refers to four fictional humanoid turtles named Leonardo, Donatello, Michelangelo, and Raphael. They practice ninjutsu and various Japanese martial arts, while guided by a humanoid rat, Splinter, as their sensei. Their best human friend is a woman named April O'Neil.

Nickelodeon purchased the TMNT franchise from Mirage Studios and 4Kids Entertainment in October 2009.[1]

Notes[]

Although Nickelodeon's ownership of the Ninja Turtles franchise has always included the rights to the characters' depictions from the 1987 animated series produced by Fred Wolf Films (including its characters appearing in a few crossover episodes of the 2012 series, video games, and various merchandise depicting the 1987 characters produced since 2010), Nickelodeon would not own the original cartoon itself until July 20, 2023.

Nickelodeon also doesn't own the 1990 film series and the 2007 film, which are owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, though every of the movies is streaming on Paramount+.

The live action movie version of the turtles are among the avatars that appear in the film Ready Player One.
