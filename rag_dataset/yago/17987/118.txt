Oh, my. Those of you attending Tokyo Gore Night at the New York Asian Film Festival later on tonight are in for a treat. Though it hasn't been shown to the public yet, Machine Girl director Noboru Iguchi has been running around the fest with a great big smile on his face and a copy of the trailer for his latest - RoboGeisha - on his person and was good enough to give me an early look. He considers this version too spoiler-heavy to put online, but here's what I can tell you:

Robot Geisha's obviously. Lots of them. Transforming robot geishas. And also samurais. And I believe a ninja or two. In a clan war. With robotic buildings as weapons, katanas out the bum, katanas out the arm pits, fried shrimp shoved into eyes. It is absolutely daft, the budget and scope of it look significantly higher than on Machine Girl and I can't wait to see more.
