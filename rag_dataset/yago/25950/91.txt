Gilroy subsesquently branched out into directing, and sometimes producing, quirky films based on his own highly personal screenplays such as "Desperate Characters" (1971), "From Noon Till Three" (1976), "Once in Paris. ." (1978) and "The Gig" (1985). Son John Gilroy served as associate producer and editor on his father's 1989 film "The Luckiest Man in the World" and sons Dan ("Freejack" 1992) and Tony are both screenwriters.
