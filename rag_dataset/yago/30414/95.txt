Based on the JAMA paper here's a photographic hall of fame based on Tutankhamun's new ly proposed family tree, just for a bit of fun. I'm sorry that they're not better - these are just the ones I have kicking around on my laptop. One does wonder what some of them looked like in "real life".

Yuya and his wife Thuya were the parents of Tiye (a daughter).

Yuya

Thuya

Tiye was married to the pharaoh Amenhotep III, the son of the pharaoh Thutmose IV and his wife Mutemwiya.

Queen Tiye, the "Elder Lady" in KV35

(with thanks to the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology)

Tiye and Amenhotep III produced Amenhotep IV (who re-named himself Akhenaten). He married a daughter of Amenhotep III (but not necessarily of Queen Tiye) whose name is unknown but has been identified as "The Younger Lady", a mummy found in a cache of three in KV35. Amenhotep kept a harem and had 5 daughters, of which she was apparently one.

The Younger Lady (not at her best, unfortunately!)

Akhenaten and his sister, the Younger Lady, produced Tutankhamun and, it is proposed, a sister to whom Tutankhamun may have been married and with whom he had two stillborn children.
