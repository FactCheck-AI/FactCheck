ER star Parminder Nagra has married her long-time boyfriend in California.

The British TV star and photographer James Stenson have been together for seven years.

They tied the knot in a Sikh service known as Anand Karaj, which means "blissful union".

The 33-year-old star of Bend It Like Beckham announced last month she was expecting their first child in the summer.

Parminder, who is one of the highest-paid British actors working abroad, said her marriage vows in front of a small group of friends and family at a private home in Hollywood.

"We are thrilled and overjoyed at the prospect of becoming first-time parents," she said.

The actress, who kept her English accent to play Dr Neela Rasgotra, said the couple will stay in LA, even though this series of ER will be the last.
