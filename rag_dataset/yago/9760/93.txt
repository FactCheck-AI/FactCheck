In the fictional and hypnotic Rain City, ex-cop Hawk (Kris Kristofferson) has just been released from prison after serving hard time for killing a man. Meanwhile, a young down-on-his-luck father, Coop (Keith Carradine), and his radiant, innocent wife, Georgia (Lori Singer), head toward the city with their new baby in search of a new life. Littered with eccentric gangsters and thugs, Rain City serves as almost a side street to human evolution. At the center of it all is Wandas, a dive diner run by Hawks ex (Genevieve Bujold), where the characters lives will intersect, changing them forever. Written and directed by Alan Rudolph, Trouble in Mind is set somewhere in the future and the past of countless classic film noirs, creating a completely realized neo-noir masterpiece. Feature has been newly restored from original film elements.
