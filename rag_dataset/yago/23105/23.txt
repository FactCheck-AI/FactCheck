Where to Watch

This lighthearted comedy-drama, which has an unexpected twist at the end, was considered quite "modern" in its day. Although Pam (Marie Prevost) is happily married to Bill Billings (Kenneth Harlan), she's not quite ready to settle down. Her playful ways are imitated by Bill's niece (Lucille Rickson), who idolizes her. One of Pam's admirers is Kingdon (since he's played by Philo McCullough, you know he's going to cause trouble). While Bill is training for an auto race, Kingdon tries to steal Pam away. But Pam refuses to attend a party with him, and he asks the niece instead. Pam, knowing that Kingdon is not to be trusted, follows the girl to his apartment. But Bill is not far behind and he winds up in a fight with Kingdon. Pam is able to explain everything, but the fight has left Bill with a broken arm. Since he can't drive his race car, Pam does it for him, and wins the contest.
