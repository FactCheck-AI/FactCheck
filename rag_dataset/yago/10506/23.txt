Noomi Rapace has signed on to a new film from Twilight director Catherine Hardwicke.

The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo star will portray the Swedish singer Anita Lindblom in a biopic about the 60s icon's life, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Rapace has been attached to the project for several years along with her husband Ola Rapace. He will star in the film as well, playing Bosse Hogberg, a boxing champion who was married to Lindblom.

The actress is currently shooting Prometheus, formerly known as the Alien prequel, alongside Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Idris Elba and Guy Pearce.

In March, Rapace described her character in Prometheus as significantly different from Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in the Alien films, stating that she does not believe people will compare the two once they see Prometheus.

Last year, Rapace revealed that she thought her performance in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo would be hated, claiming that she never believed that readers of the book the movie is based on would accept her interpretation of the character.

Rapace can be seen next in the Sherlock Holmes sequel opposite Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law.
