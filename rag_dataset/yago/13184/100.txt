Only one day til the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival starts! I'll be at the opening night film, Americanese by Eric Byler. (Byler was the director of Charlotte Sometimes, which screened at the festival three years ago.) The film is based on Shawn Wong's novel American Knees. I'm curious to see how this novel will be translated on to the screen.

Here's a story in the Chron about our friends who run the festival: Asian American Vision Expands.

Better get your tickets now because screenings tend to sell out, especially on the weekends. That goes for me too. I've usually mapped out what I will be seeing by this point, but this year I'm behind and haven't read the catalog yet! Any recommendations? What do you plan to see?
