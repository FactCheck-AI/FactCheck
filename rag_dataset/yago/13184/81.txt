At the midpoint of the 2006 SXSW Film Conference and Festival here in Austin, organizers presented jury and audience prizes for this year’s festival. Eric Byler‘s “AMERICANese” won two prizes tonight in Austin, receiving the narrative audience award and a special jury prize for outstanding ensemble cast. The win was particularly sweet for Byler, since he also won the audience prize at SXSW four years ago for his previous feature, “Charlotte Sometimes“. The festival’s narrative jury award went to Andy Robin and Gregg Kavet‘s “Live Free or Die“. Andrew Neel and Luke Meyer‘s “Darkon” won the documentary audience award and Mark Woollen‘s “Jam” was the jury prize winner in the doc competition.

While the conference concluded tonight at the Austin Convention Center, followed by a concert party featuring Sleater-Kinney, the film festival program will continue through the weekend alongside the massive SXSW Music fest.

SXSW co-founder Louis Black welcomed attendees to tonight’s informal ceremony, reminding attendees that when the SXSW music event was founded twenty years ago, it was created by film students, he added that years later he is excited by the success of the film fest and conference. “These are not auditions for Hollywood,” Black said, “They are films that are made to fulfill a vision.” Adding about the film fest, he said, “I swear to god its not about money, its not about celebrity, its about the films.
