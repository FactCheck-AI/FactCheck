Interestingly premised and structured 20-part serial about an heiress who must solve twenty mysteries before her guardian will allow her to marry. Unfortunately, most of the episodes of the serial have been lost but the first two are intriguingly exotic and unusual in that the heroine is out to save her man. Lead actress, Marguerite Snow, is quite fetching and plucky in the titular role and James Cruze is appropriately menacing as her evil uncle.

One of the earliest of the serials that gripped moviegoers from before WW1. It's incomplete now, with only three episodes surviving. The production values of those that do survive seem quite high (they were made by Thanhouser) but the plots are crude and poorly constructed. Episode 2 sees James Cruze, the boyfriend of the titular heroine (Marguerite Snow) trapped in one of those rooms in which the walls are slowly closing in on him, but director Frederick Sullivan wrings absolutely no suspense from the situation because it takes forver for Cruze to be rescued. Zudora is an interesting watch for those interested in early cinema or the development of movie serials, but others might find it hard work.
