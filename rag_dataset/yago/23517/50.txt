The following text is a translation of page 7 of Der Deutsche Correspondent from July 20, 1913. The translation is by Alex Russell.

In the peaceful secluded woods on the declivity of the Wanglong Shan marshes, west of Peking, a sixth grave will soon be added to the five imperial graves of the Manchu dynasty; that of the Empress Dowager Longyu (Feb. 22 1913), wife of the deceased Emperor Guangxu (Nov. 1908). Emperor Guangxu is often called a martyr to the throne. Even more of the martyrdom was borne by the silent, selfless Longyu, who was almost always a plaything of strange vagaries. And peculiarly the burial of this simple, devoted woman, ever lingering in the background as Empress, Regent, and mother, has been turned into a grandiose assembly in Peking, one that on such occasion no other woman in China has been bestowed.
