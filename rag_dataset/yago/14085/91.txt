Television couple Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan, who have been married for fourteen years now, had the cutest wishes for each other. They celebrated their togetherness with an aww-dorable lip lock.

Hiten posted a picture on Instagram with a beautiful caption for his wifey dear, "Happy anniversary my world @gpradhan ..thank you for everything #GHTTogetherForever #14yearsandcounting #LifeofHT #hitentejwaniofficial #life #family."

The good looking couple, who tied the knot in 2004, have two kids together--Katya and Neevan Tejwani.

The much-in-love couple had first met each other at an airport. And at that time, they didn't even know that they were going to team up for popular show Kutumb (where their love story began).

Also, it was very refreshing to see the two of them together when Gauri came to meet Hiten in Bigg Boss 11.

Last they worked together for a dance reality show Nach Baliye in 2006.
