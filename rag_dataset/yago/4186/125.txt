Abel Gance: The Charm of Dynamite

Winner of the 1976 American Film Festival Blue Ribbon for Best Film on Cinema, an introduction to the creative genius of the great French director, Abel Gance, with sequences from his Napoleon (1927), La Roue (1922), and J'Accuse (1919).

Using footage shot during the making of Napoleon, Kevin Brownlow gives us a rare view of an early film masterpiece in production. We discover that Gance was already working with hand-held camera, wide-angle lenses, rapid cutting, multiple superimpositions and panoramic screen, in the twenties. Later, in 1934, he introduced stereophonic sound to film.
