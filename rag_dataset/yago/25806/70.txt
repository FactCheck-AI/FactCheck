If you enjoyed the video the other day of the delightful Robin Strasser as pro-gay mayoral candidate Dorian Lord on One Life to Live, these scenes from Wednesday’s episode features more of her wonderful interaction with ex-campaign manager and ex-husband David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) who she says has no loyalty to her because he wouldn’t pretend he was gay in order to garner her votes. (note: the photo of Tuc Watkins as David has nothing to do with this episode, but isn’t it hot?)

Dorian doesn’t need Dzvid to be gay anymore anyway because she has hired a new campaign manager and is sure to introduce her to the Lanview citizenry as “an out and proud lesbian” in this episode. Little dose she know that this woman, who David says is “from lesbania” cannot be trusted!

I just think Miss Strasser is so delicious as Dorian – always has been – and hopefully always will be! Her holding a baby is an absolute riot.

The epsiode also includes some of the handsome Nick (Nicholas Rodriguez) who is substitute teaching. When some of the girls in class remark how cute he is, one of the othewr students informs that that “he is g-a-y.” Nick overhears and tells them the correct name of the gay alliance that he is president of and says “if any of you have any questions about it feel free to ask me about it – after class.”

Then we learn that Nick and Amelia, the lesbian campaign manager, are in cahoots together to do something sneaky in the mname of LGBT rights.

Stay tuned!
