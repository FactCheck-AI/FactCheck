Ali Wentworth shares adorable photo of her two daughters with George Stephanopoulos to promote Robin Roberts' book

Ali Wentworth has shared a picture of her two rarely-seen daughters in a move to help a member of her extended family: Robin Roberts.

The actress and comedian is married to Good Morning America co-anchor George Stephanopoulos and they have two daughters together but actively try to keep the girls out of the public eye.

Wentworth put them in the forefront today, however, as she posed with them in a photo alongside her husband's Good Morning America colleague's new book.

The tweet coincided with the release of Roberts' new book 'Everybody's Got Something' which hits bookstands today.

Wentworth's daughters- Elliott, 11, and Harper, 9- are seen smiling on either side of their mom whose eyes peek out over the cover of Roberts' book.

'Look what we're reading @RobinRoberts,' Wentworth wrote as a caption.

Roberts returned the favor, posting a photo of Stephanopoulos playfully photo bombing Barbara Walters at a book launch party that Wentworth and Stephanopoulos hosted on her behalf.

While he may have been slightly embarrassed by the latter, her husband, the former Clinton aide turned morning show host, promptly retweeted this morning's photo of his daughters.

The couple have been married for 12 years after meeting two months earlier on a blind date.

'He dated the whole island of Manhattan before I came along,' she joked in an interview with Charlie Rose last year when she was promoting her own book.

'It wasn't love at first sight. It was I sat with him and there was this amazing comfort and it really felt like being home.'

Their quick courtship jumped right into marriage and promptly started having children.
