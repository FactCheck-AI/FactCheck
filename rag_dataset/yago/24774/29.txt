Handsome young actor Robert Sterling began making movies during Hollywood's Golden Era in the 1930's

He later went onto do television work, most notably the TV series Topper where he and Anne Jeffreys played ghostly companions to befuddled Leo G. Carroll, along with their drunken ghost dog, Neal.

He married Anne Jeffreys (his second marriage which produced 3 sons) and they stayed together for 55 years until his death.

He was quite the looker back in the day.

Daughter Tisha wrote a memoir a couple years ago called "Why I Failed Charm School," I just learned. She was five when her parents divorced. According to one review, her father, who married Anne Jeffreys a couple years later, was not very available. Apparently in the last decade of his life--he died at 88--he suffered from shingles. Elders, if you,had chicken pox, get the Shingrix vac!
