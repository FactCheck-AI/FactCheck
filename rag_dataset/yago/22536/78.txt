Madonna has given a surprise lecture at a New York university, discussing her career and new documentary.

The star, who performed a shock DJ slot in a Manhattan nightclub at the weekend, arrived unannounced at City University‘s Hunter College as part of MTV series ‘Stand In’, reports the BBC.

Students expected a screening of her new documentary, ‘I’m Going To Tell You a Secret’, but they were also given the chance to question the singer.

“The biggest mistake that any of us can make is to believe what other people say about us,” she told the class.

Students asked Madonna about the film, her interest in Kabbalah – a Jewish sect – and the variety in her music and public image.

“I don’t feel like I’m trying on personas,” she said.

“What I always hope to do is change and evolve. I have no regrets because that’s life and life is about change.”

Afterwards student Ruomi Lee-Hampel said: “Hearing a director speak about his work was my purpose in coming.

“It was just an added bonus to see Madonna in fishnets.”

‘Stand In’ is broadcast on MTVu, a spin-off channel shown on college campuses and the internet. The episode featuring Madonna will be broadcast on 7 November.

Previous surprise lecturers include goth rocker Marilyn Manson, Microsoft founder Bill Gates and rapper Kanye West.
