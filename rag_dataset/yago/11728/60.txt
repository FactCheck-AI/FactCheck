This original cinematic adaptation of the iconic J.R.R Tolkien tale faithfully captures Bilbo Baggins’ legendary adventure with remarkable accuracy, with intricate (if not strikingly bizarre) hand-drawn backgrounds and animations. From the team that brought you Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and The Last Unicorn, Rankin and Bass’ The Hobbit will not disappoint anyone that is brave enough to join Bilbo on his fateful adventure! (Also secretly a Studio Ghibli film).
