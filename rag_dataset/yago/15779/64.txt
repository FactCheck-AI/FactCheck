NEW YORK — Director Peter Sollett’s “Raising Victor Vargas” will open the 32nd New Directors/New Films series.

Coming-of-age tale is the story of a teenage Romeo on the Lower East Side trying to woo an indifferent Juliet. Pic was scripted by Sollett from a story co-written with Eva Vives.

“Vargas” is Sollett’s feature debut. Previous credits include short “Five Feet High and Rising,” which screened at the 2000 ND/NF fest and picked up short film kudos at Sundance and Cannes in 2000.

Samuel Goldwyn Films and Fireworks Pictures have set a March 28 release date.

Presented by the film and media department of the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center, festival will depart from its traditional MOMA location because of renovation work at the museum. This year, screenings will be held at Alice Tully Hall and the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center as well as MOMA’s temporary Gramercy Theater venue.

Complete ND/NF slate will be announced in February.
