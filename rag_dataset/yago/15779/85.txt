First-time director Peter Solletts Raising Victor Vargas begins with bluster and ends with innocence, if not regained then at least recognized. Victor (Victor Rasuk) is at ﬁrst so crudely callow that I almost wrote off the whole movie. Caught in the sack with "Fat Donna," this would-be 15-year-old lothario of the Lower East Side barrio tries to redeem his reputation by hitting on the neighborhood beauty, the icy and aloof "Juicy Judy" Ramirez (Judy Marte). His secret to success with women? As he explains to his virginal though otherwise almost identical-looking younger brother Carlos (Wilfree Vasquez), "Lick your lips."
