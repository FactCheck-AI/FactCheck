Beer, broads and softball combine with hilarious results in ARTIE LANGE`S BEER LEAGUE, and over-the-top comedy about a group of misfits whose weekly softball games descend more into fights for macho dominance than making home runs. When love enters his life, it unexpectedly alters Artie`s low self-esteem; and the odds for winning--not only the league trophy but a new life--are considerably amped along with the comedy and chaos.
