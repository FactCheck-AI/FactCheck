Dimpy Ganguly, who is currently in France, further added that she hopes Natalya isn't subjected to domestic violence."People can change you know. For the sake of both, I really hope all that doesn't happen. It's the worst thing one can do to another," she said.

Both marriages of Rahul Mahajan ended with accusations of domestic violence. His first wife Shweta was his childhood friend and the two knew each other for 13 years. She had accused him of physically abusing her. The couple got separated in December 2007, and were granted divorce in 2008.

In the same year, Rahul Mahajan participated in Bigg Boss 8, where closer to grand finale, he tried to escape the house and was thrown out of the show. He was linked to starlets like Payal Rohatgi and Monica Bedi on Bigg Boss.

Rahul Mahajan got married to Dimpy Ganguly on national TV in 2010 on reality show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayega. The couple got divorced four years later on February 25, 2014, after his second wife accused him of kicking, punching and beating her up.
