Dani Levy is no stranger to controversy

Filming starts on a controversial new project this month - a comedy, in German, about Adolf Hitler.

It is the work of the Swiss Jewish director Dani Levy, who in 2005 had a big hit with a comedy called Alles auf Zucker! - about Jews in Germany today.

The new film, Mein Fuehrer - The real truth about Adolf Hitler, will portray the Nazi leader as a weakling helped to the top by a Jewish comedian.

Mr Levy says Nazi leaders have been "put on pedestals" in documentaries.

It is time to take them down, he says.

The Berlin and Brandenburg Film Board, a public body, put up more than $500,000 to help finance the film.

Mr Levy's film Alles auf Zucker! (Go for Zucker!) was a huge risk, but was well received. His new project is even more ambitious.
