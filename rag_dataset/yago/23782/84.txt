Sixteen months after their lavish, star-studded New York wedding, singer-actress Liza Minnelli and her fourth husband, producer David Gest, have separated.

Newsday.com quoted Minnelli's spokesman as confirming the pair had split up and cited an unnamed source close to the couple as saying Gest, 49, was staying in Hawaii while Minnelli, 57, daughter of the late Judy Garland, remained in her Manhattan apartment.

Minnelli's publicist, Warren Cowan, was not immediately available for comment.

But the report of the separation surfaced as the couple abruptly cancelled a joint interview they had scheduled for next week on CNN's Larry King Live.

A spokeswoman for the show confirmed their appearance was called off but declined to give further details.
