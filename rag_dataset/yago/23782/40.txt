Police and paramedics were called to the luxury Four Seasons Hotel early on Tuesday to find the 62-year-old’s body, The Sun, a British tabloid, reported.

The former contestant on Britain’s “Celebrity Big Brother” show and Minnelli married in 2002, but separated after a year. However, the two officially divorced only in 2007.
