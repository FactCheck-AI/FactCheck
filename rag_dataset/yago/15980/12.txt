Bruce Willis and Emma Heming Willis have been by each other’s side since their early 2000s meet-cute.

The duo met in 2007 while working out at their mutual trainer’s gym. After two years of dating, Emma and Bruce walked down the aisle in Turks and Caicos. Six days later, they wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills.

In 2012, the twosome welcomed their first child together, daughter Mabel. Two years later, they expanded their family with daughter Evelyn. (Willis previously welcomed three daughters, Rumer Willis, Scout Willis and Tallulah Willis, with ex-wife Demi Moore.)

Nearly three years after Bruce and Heming Willis renewed their vows for their 10th wedding anniversary, the Willis family revealed in March 2022 that Bruce had been diagnosed with aphasia and would be retiring from acting. They gave fans an update on Bruce’s condition in February 2023, sharing that he received a “more specific diagnosis” of frontotemporal dementia (FTD), for which there are no treatments.
