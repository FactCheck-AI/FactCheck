Oh My Godzilla!

[KAIJŪ SŌ-SHINGEKI] [怪獣総進撃]

The original Godzilla team of director Ishiro Honda, special-effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya and composer Akira Ifukube reunited for this kaiju extravaganza, which features no fewer than 11 monsters. Set in the remote future of 1999, when the people of Earth have achieved world peace by confining destructive creatures to Monsterland (until an alien race intervenes), DESTROY ALL MONSTERS mounts a thrilling display of innovative action sequences and memorable images that have made it a favorite for generations of viewers.
