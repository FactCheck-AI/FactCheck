Personal life

Born in Belper, Derbyshire, Kendall attended Derby & District College of Art where she studied painting and design. She was a fabric designer at British Celanese and then became a photographic model before becoming an actress.

In 1968 Kendall married pianist, comedian and actor Dudley Moore, and though they divorced in 1972, they remained friends until Moore's death in 2002. Following the divorce she remarried shortly afterwards to Sandy Harper. In 2002 she hosted a memorial service for Moore attended by her second husband and daughter.

Kendall and her friend Pat Wellington wrote Natural Appeal: Fragrant Natural Preparations for the Care of Skin, Hair and Body, a book on beauty tips.

Kendall now lives in London with her second husband Sandy Harper. Their daughter Elodie Harper is a journalist at ITV Anglia.

In 2012, Kendall made her first film appearance in 35 years in Berberian Sound Studio, billed in some sources as the mother of the lead character Gilderoy, played by Toby Jones, though the end credits on the film list her as "special guest screamer". The film is about a sound engineer working on an Italian giallo thriller, which alludes to several appearances she made in the genre during the 1970s.
