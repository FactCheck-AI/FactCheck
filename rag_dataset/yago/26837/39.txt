About the Book:

Succinct, practical, and always engaging insights into the art of film directing from the controversial Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright

Calling on his unique perspective as playwright, screenwriter, and director of his own critically acclaimed movies, House of Games and Things Change, David Mamet illuminates how a film comes to be.

He looks at every aspect of directing — from script to cutting room — to show the many tasks directors undertake in reaching their prime objective: presenting a story that will be understood by the audience and has the power to be both surprising and inevitable at the same time.

Based on a series of classes David Mamet taught at Columbia University's film school, On Directing Film will be enjoyed not only by students but by anyone interested in an overview of the craft of filmmaking.

What people say:

"Passion, clarity, commitment, intelligence — just what one would expect from Mamet." — Sidney Lumet
