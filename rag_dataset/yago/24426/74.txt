Located in the Indian Ocean, Moheli is the smallest island in the Comoros archipelago, with a total land area of 290 km2. It boasts an incredible mosaic of ecosystems, including primary rainforests and dry forests, coral reefs and mangroves, and is home to exceptional biodiversity!

The island is unique in that ¾ of its territory is classified as a national park. Thanks to the determination of its inhabitants and those involved in the protected area, the island will be classified as a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 2021.

However, this unique place is now under threat from climate change and increasing human pressure on its natural areas. Forest ecosystems have not been spared: studies have shown that the average annual rate of deforestation is 1.65%, largely due to the expansion of agricultural land. Since January 2022, Noé has therefore been implementing a 5-year technical assistance project for the Moheli National Park to set up a project to combat deforestation and forest degradation.
