Victor Salva on the set of Jeepers Creepers 2

On this edition of Parallax Views, the second in a two-part expos√© of convicted Hollywood pedophile Victor Salva. Salva is perhaps most famous for writing and directing the Jeepers Creepers (2001-2017) franchise and the Disney movie Powder (1995). Before making his big break, however, the low-budget horror movie Clownhouse (1989). Salva was convicted of molesting that film's 12 year old star, Nathan Forrest Winters in 1988. Despite this, Salva has maintained a career in Hollywood and his latest feature, Jeepers Creepers 3 (2017), was given a theatrical rerelease for the Halloween season this year.

In part one, CSA (Childhood Sexual Abuse) survivor Nathan Forest Winter joined us to tell his story of abuse perpetrated by Salva, the process of healing, and his upcoming documentary 7he 6oy. In part two, Connar Frazier, the director of 7he 6oy, joins us to discuss Nathan's story and Victor Salva further. Connar also discusses how their documentary, 7he 6oy, came about, their experiences making it, and more.

Additionally, the intro to this episode features a very brief clip of testimony from Brian McHugh, Nathan's co-star in Clownhouse, that Connar has offered to us as a Parallax Views exclusive.
