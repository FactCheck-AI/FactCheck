Film: Stray Dog

1949, dir. Akira Kurosawa

Legendary director Akira Kurosawa’s Stray Dog set the template for police procedural and buddy cop films for years to follow. The film is an early collaboration between Kurosawa and famed actor Toshiro Mifune, who stars as a young detective whose gun is stolen on a hot, crowded bus. Desperate to right the wrong, he goes undercover, scavenging Tokyo’s sweltering streets for the stray dog whose desperation has led him to a life of crime. Costarring Takashi Shimura as the seasoned detective who keeps him on the right side of the law, Stray Dog (Nora inu) goes beyond crime thriller, probing the squalid world of postwar Japan and the nature of the criminal mind.
