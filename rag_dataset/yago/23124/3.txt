Because of Father's Day, which was celebrated on Sunday, June 16, actress and businesswoman Demi Moore became emotional and through her Instagram account celebrated her ex-husband, actor Bruce Willis, to whom she was married for 13 years.

Moore and Willis have three daughters together, Rumer Willis, Tallulah Belle Willis and Scout LaRue Willis and that is motivation enough to commemorate the father of the family even if the parents are not together anymore.

The actress of "Ghost: the shadow of love" and "An indecent proposal" posted family photos that touched her millions of followers. She took the opportunity to shower the 69-year-old actor with praise due to Father's Day. "We all love Bruce! One of my favorites. Thank you for your work. He is exceptional", "the man and his princesses" and "what a beautiful man, the complete package", are some of the comments that are read in the post.

It was a very emotional day for the whole family

Through the photos people can see how Bruce Willis grew up hand in hand with his three oldest daughters. In addition, Demi Moore also included images in which her ex-partner's two youngest daughters appear, since she remarried in 2009.

He found love again with the British model Emma Heming, with whom he has two daughters, Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn. This did not prevent Demi Moore to recognize the father of her children.

As if that were not enough, the 61-year-old actress dedicated a message to the "Die Hard" and "Sixth Sense" actor. "Happy Father's Day to our favorite dad. We love you, BW!", reads the publication, which has more than 370 thousand reactions.

Although Demi Moore and Bruce separated in 2000, they have always maintained a good relationship. They transformed their love as a couple into friendship and that allowed them to have a composite family because the "Striptease" actress hangs out with the actor's current wife, as well as his daughters, ever since the actor was diagnosed with aphasia.
