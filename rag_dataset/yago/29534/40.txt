The buzz about Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's marriage has been non-stop for the past year.

The couple, who often arrive separately at events, sparked even more rumours recently when Abhishek liked a divorce-related post on social media, sending fans into a frenzy.

At the grand wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant in Mumbai last week, Abhishek was seen with his parents, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, while Aishwarya and their daughter Aaradhya made a separate entrance, which further fueled the separation rumours.

However, the reason behind Abhishek's eyebrow-raising social media activity has finally come to light.

According to a Reddit user, Abhishek liked the post not because of any trouble in paradise but to support Zerek Marker, a close friend of Aishwarya.

Fans can now breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that Abhishek's gesture was just a friendly nod to a longtime friend of the family.

Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, one of Bollywood's most celebrated couples, tied the knot on April 20, 2007, in a grand ceremony that captured the nation's attention.

Their marriage has since been under constant media scrutiny, with the couple often making headlines for their professional achievements and personal life.

Despite persistent rumours and speculations about their relationship, the pair has continued to present a united front, frequently seen together at major events and supporting each other's careers in the entertainment industry.
