Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan’s marriage clocked in 17 years on April 20, 2024.

To honor this occasion, the couple collaborated on floating the exact same post on their respective Instagram profiles.

They shared an adorable photo, squeezed in with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, who had sported an exact facial expression as Aishwarya, even resting her head on the star’s shoulder.

On the other hand, Abhishek went in for a wide grin as he stood closely behind them.

Fans quickly rushed in to comment that this is a very sweet way for the duo to celebrate their anniversary as they didn’t forget to appreciate their child, who is the biggest gift that has ever been presented to them for having tied the knot in 2007.

Abhishek has stated in an interview of having started as friends with Aishwarya during the shoot of the 2000 romantic drama, Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke.

He fell in love while filming Dhoom 2 and Umrao Jaan together simultaneously, and soon got involved in a serious relationship with her.
