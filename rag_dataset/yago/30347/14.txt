Actress Kassie DePaiva is returning to TV.

The 62-year-old star is set to reprise her One Life To Live alter ego Blair Cramer to General Hospital again, according to TV Line.

The episodes will air in September, an ABC rep told the outlet.

Kassie first debuted as Blair Cramer in 1992 on One Life To Live.

She played the character Blair for almost 900 episodes on One Life To Live until 2013.

Kassie appeared in General Hospital as Blair for two episodes in 2012.

Roger Howarth, who played her on-screen husband on Todd Manning, still stars on General Hospital.

On a possible reunion on the show, Kassie said: 'There's a lot of history there, a lot of time, a lot of water under that bridge,' via TV Line.

'But I guess Todd is not Todd, right? So if I was to go back on that show, he probably wouldn't recognize me. But I could go, "You're hot. You look like somebody I use to know."'

Kassie also appeared in Days of Our Lives, from 2014 until 2020.

She starred as Eve Donovan in Days of Our Lives for 380 episodes.

Kassie started her acting career in 1986 on Guiding Light; she played the character Chelsea Reardon until 1991.

Her film debut came in 1987 in Evil Dead II; she has also had roles in Melrose Place, Baywatch and Castle.

Kassie married her One Life To Live co-star James DePaiva, 65.

James played Max Holden on the show from 1987 until 1990, as well as 1991 to 2003 and a brief return in 2007.

Kassie and James wed in May 1986, and welcome their son, James, in 1997.
