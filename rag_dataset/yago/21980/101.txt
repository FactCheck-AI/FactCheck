Commonwealth Shakespeare Company and The Coolidge Corner Theatre present a “Shakespeare Reimagined” Series Screening of “A Midwinter’s Tale”.

Kenneth Branagh writes and directs this comic tale about an out-of-work actor’s desperate attempt to salvage his career and his life by staging a production of Hamlet. In this salute to dyed-in-the-wool and other woolly-brained thespians, Michael Maloney (Truly Madly Deeply) portrays Joe, maxing out credit cards and his wits to realize his dream. Does he succeed? Well, with Richard Briers (Branagh’s Hamlet), Joan Collins (“Dynasty”), Nicholas Farrell (Chariots of Fire), “Absolutely Fabulous” alumna Jennifer Saunders and Julia Sawatha, and more joining Maloney, one thing’s certain: the show must go on!

Bryn Boice, director of CSC’s 2024 Shakespeare on the Common production of The Winter’s Tale, will lead a post-screening discussion with guest panelists, professor Nathan Blake and actress Karen MacDonald (Gertrude, CSC’s Hamlet.)
