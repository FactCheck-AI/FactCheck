Christie’s definitive mystery novel was previously adapted into a 1974 Academy Award-winning film, starring Albert Finney in the lead role. Set on the famous train during a snowstorm, the story follows famed detective Poirot as he attempts to solve the murder mystery of a fellow passenger. The whodunit is one of Christie's most well-known novels.

Branagh recently directed a live-action version of "Cinderella," starring Lily James and Cate Blanchett. His directing film credits also include the Shakespearean adaptations "As You Like It," "Hamlet," "A Midwinter's Tale" and "Much Ado About Nothing."

The eponymous actor/director/producer is also the head of the Kenneth Branagh Theatre Company, supported by Rob Ashford and Christopher Oram as artistic associates. Earlier this year, the company announced a year-long residency of five productions to be staged at the West End's Garrick Theatre. The opening productions, Terrence Rattigan's Harlequinade and Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale, opened this month featuring Branagh himself, Judi Dench and Zoё Wanamaker.
