The correct answer is the Los Angeles Rams. "Heaven Can Wait" (1978) is a romantic fantasy about the life of Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty). Joe is the top quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams football team. One day before his official scheduled date he is accidentally summoned to Heaven by an overly zealous celestial escort.

Joe is shortly returned to earth in the body of another man (Leo Farnsworth). This individual is a corporate giant (an executive 'business expert'). While practicing to once again play pro football for the Rams, Joe must escape murder attempts on his current life as Farnsworth. Also at the same time, he is romantically pursuing a beautiful English woman (Julie Christie), who is protesting the destruction caused to her village in England by one of the many corporations now owned by Joe/Leo.

Here the film itself is an adaptation of a screen play by Harry Segall. The play had the same name; this later film was produced and directed by Warren Beatty for Paramount Pictures. In the prior film that was made in 1941 by Columbia Pictures, it was called, "Here Comes Mr. Jordan." It starred Robert Montgomery, Evelyn Keyes, and Claude Rains. It and the 1978 film have the same type of focus, but in this earlier tale, Joe Pendleton is a boxer and amateur pilot.
