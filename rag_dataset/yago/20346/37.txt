It's difficult to describe this film without spoiling it, so I'll be brief. John Bolton is an artist, known for his paintings of vampiric female nudes. The film follows a reporter's attempts to get Bolton to explain his artistic process; to find out the answer to the eternal question, "Where do you get your ideas?"

This is writer Neil Gaiman's directorial debut. It had its world premiere at the 2003 San Diego Comic-con, and will be released on DVD in December 2004. I've been a fan of Gaiman's since the late 80's, when I read my first issue of his horror/fantasy epic comic book series "The Sandman", and I was glad to see that his writing style carries over to his directing style. It will be interesting to see what he can do with a bigger budget when he makes his feature- film directorial debut, but, in the meantime, this is a nice taste of what's to come.
