Now that X-Men film fans know who the director of the third film is going to be: Matthew Vaughn, many may be wondering what kind of film he's likely to make.

A background piece on Vaughn's short, but impressive, career can be read at The Beat. It goes beyond his producer credits on Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and director debut on Layer Cake to link Vaughn with the comic book world.

Here's an excerpt: "[H]e also produced Neil Gaiman's short film about artist John Bolton, A SHORT FILM ABOUT JOHN BOLTON, and has optioned Gaiman's fantasy novel, STARDUST. So obviously he knows a bit about comics.

"Vaughn's first directing effort, LAYER CAKE, hasn't been seen in the US yet, but garnered strong reviews in the UK: 'Helicopter shots of Canary Wharf, silent West End mews and jittery chase scenes create a mystique rarely tapped by his peers'." A trailer for that film can be downloaded at the site as well.
