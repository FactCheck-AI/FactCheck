On May 24, DGA members and guests gathered at the Charlotte Street Hotel in London for a special evening with Director M. Night Shyamalan. The event was hosted by the DGA London Coordinating Committee (LCC) and featured a Q&A with the visionary filmmaker moderated by Director Tom Hooper (Les Misérables).

After a cocktail reception and an introduction by LCC Co-Chair Jim Gillespie, the audience was entertained by a rousing discussion about Shyamalan’s career.

Known for his unique films that often capture the reality of ordinary individuals caught up in extraordinary circumstances, Director M. Night Shyamalan’s first features were the semi-autobiographical Praying with Anger and the comedy/drama Wide Awake. In 1999, he wrote and directed the hit thriller The Sixth Sense which earned him international recognition, six Academy Award nominations, and a DGA Award nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Feature Film. Shyamalan’s other feature films include Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender, and the recently released sci-fi adventure After Earth.

Established in 2007 to support the more than 300 DGA members in the UK and Ireland, the LCC hosts seminars, screenings and other events. In addition to Co-Chairs Michael Caton-Jones and Jim Gillespie, the Committee’s membership includes Directors Antonia J. Bird, Tom Hooper, Richard Loncraine, Roger H. Michell, Mike Newell, Chris J. Newman, Jim Sheridan, and David Yates.
