The soundtrack of New Wave hits and rarities helps make Me Without You a rich look at the way some people spent the 1970s and 1980s. Director Sandra Goldbacher fades in on the year 1982 not with Bruce Springsteen but with the Normal's electricity-zapped "Warm Leatherette." Scritti Politti's "Sweetest Girl" accompanies the courtship between Marina and Daniel, and that's canny. But if songs alone could make a movie, Wes Anderson would be as good as Robert Altman. Me Without You shines because of Goldbacher's intimate direction--a saner, lighter version of Jane Campion's impressionism.
