FRANCE | 1994 | COLOR | 35mm | 106' | FRENCH

A colonel of Napoleon’s, considered officially dead, returns to claim back his name and fortune. But his wife is remarried to a social climber of Louis XVIII’s monarchy, has two children and is at first disbelieving and then hesitant to assent.

Based on Balzac’s novel, the debut film of the great cinematographer Yves Angelo, is one the greatest moments of the last, until today, essential of French Cinema. With a fine cast, led by a magnificent Depardieu, Angelo films the social decline of the French Restoration, but also the moral decay of human nature through ambivalences, riddles and an indicative of great cinema underlining of the distance between the ostensible and the real.
