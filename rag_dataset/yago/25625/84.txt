Synopsis

Four-year-old Ponette is coming to terms with the death of mother. Distraught by her absence, she keeps calling to her, searching for her, waiting for her to return. Forced to find her own way of coping, she embarks on an emotional journey that adults will struggle to understand. Directed by Jacques Doillon, Victorie Thivisol delivers a striking performance that won her the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the 1996 Venice Film Festival. Carla Simón was deeply struck by how the director managed to coax such a heartfelt performance from such a young actress.
