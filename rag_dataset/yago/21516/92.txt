Love Affair is a story of love at first sight, and all the silly things that could only happen in the movies—but is still worth watching just because you have to find out what happens. Warren Beatty plays Mike Gambril, a sportscaster turned playboy. He hops on a plane one day, and sees a girl that he just has to get to know. That’s not unusual for Mike, as almost every girl falls into this category. But Terry McKay (Annette Bening—Beatty’s real life wife) is different, and both her and Mike are engaged, but not to each other.

The plane crash-lands on a remote tropical island, that just happens to be a short distance from another island where Mike’s aunt (Katherine Hepburn) lives. After a wonderfully romantic day spent with his aunt, and a couple more days on a cruise ship that is slowly taking them home, they feel it is time to put their love to the test. So they agree to meet in three months at the Empire State building, but only if they want to, and neither of them can call the other person to find out why they didn’t show.

Love Affair is an adult movie that may have limited interest to older teens. The PG-13 rating is due to the single use of the famous sexual expletive by none other than Katherine Hepburn. The word is there for pure shock value, and it’s much easier to market a romance with a PG-13 rating. Mike and Terry do sleep with each other shortly after they meet, but there is no on-screen sensuality. Otherwise, the language and scenes in the film are appropriate for most family members.

This movie does a better job keeping the audience awake while waiting for the big moment, than did Sleepless In Seattle. The second half is especially involving, and there are enough famous people here to keep you busy. (Was that really Ed McMahon?) If you love a romance, you should be happy with this one.

Starring Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Katharine Hepburn, Pierce Brosnan. Running time: 108 minutes. Theatrical release October 21, 1994. Updated
