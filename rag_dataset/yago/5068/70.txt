Umberto was born on September 15, 1904, in Naples, to Vittorio Emanuele III, King of Italy, and Elena, Princess of Montenegro, and upon his birth received the title of Prince of Piedmont. In 1929 Umberto married Marie Jose, Princess of Belgium, daughter of Albert I, King of the Belgians. As the Italian regent, Umberto was trained for a military career. In 1929, Umberto experienced an assassination attempt on his life while visiting Belgium, by an Italian anti-fascist freedom fighter. Umberto's relationship with the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was strained, and the two tried not to appear together at public events. In May 1942, Umberto was promoted to marshal in the Italian army When Mussolini was ousted, his father, Vittorio Emanuele, tried to flee Rome but was captured on July 26, 1943. Germany gave a direct order to execute him, and he died on August 1 of that year.

His son immediately became the new king of Italy and was soon recognized by the Allies with his title during the occupation, but Umberto inherited a very unpopular title, to say the least, with most of the Italian people claiming a link exists between Mussolini's fascist time and the House of Savoy.
