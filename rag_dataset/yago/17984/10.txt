Oira Sukeban (Japanese: おいら女蛮, "I'm a Sukeban"), sometimes called Sukeban Boy, is a Japanese manga written and illustrated by Go Nagai, serialized in Shogakukan's Weekly Shōnen Sunday from 1974 to 1976.[2] It is a comedy with several erotic touches, where the protagonist Banji Suke (or Sukeban) has to disguise himself as a girl in order to be able to attend an all-female school to try and clear his name after being left the blame for the chaos all over town, while unaware that his assassins are watching his every move. As Suke Ban is a rebellious boy, this situation creates several comedic troubles.

The manga was adapted to an OVA in 1992,[3] and was released by ADV Films in the US under the name Delinquent in Drag.[1]

It has also spawned two live-action movies, Oira Sukeban: Kessen! Pansutō (おいら女蛮 決戦!パンス党) in 1992 starring actor Shinji Takeda, and Oira Sukeban (called mostly Sukeban Boy) in 2006 starring AV idol Asami (亜紗美).
