Jack Little and Cleve Moler, the cofounders of MathWorks, recognized the need among engineers and scientists for more powerful and productive computation environments beyond those provided by languages such as Fortran and C. In response to that need, they combined their expertise in mathematics, engineering, and computer science to develop MATLAB, a high-performance technical computing environment. MATLAB combines comprehensive math and graphics functions with a powerful high-level language.

In addition to MATLAB, MathWorks now develops and markets Simulink, a product for simulating nonlinear dynamic systems. The company also develops and markets an extensive set of add-on products for specialized application areas including control design, signal processing and communications, image processing, test and measurement, computational biology, and financial modeling and analysis.
