MATLAB software & Cleve Moler

The MATLAB software we use today has a long history. It starts with the LINPACK and EISPACK projects run by the Argonne National Laboratory in the 1970s to produce high quality, tested and portable mathematical software. LINPACK is a collection of routines for linear algebra and EISPACK is a library of numerical algorithms for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices. These packages were written in Fortran which was then, and even today is, the language of choice for large-scale numerical problems.

Cleve Moler, then at the University of New Mexico, contributed to both projects and wrote the first version of \Mlab\ in the late 1970s. It allowed interactive use of LINPACK and EISPACK for problem solving without having to write and compile Fortran code. MATLAB quickly spread to other universities and found a strong audience within the applied mathematics and engineering community.

In 1984 Cleve Moler and Jack Little founded The MathWorks Inc. which exploited the newly released IBM PC --- the first widely available desktop computer that had the capability to run the LINPACK and EISPACK code sufficiently quickly to be actually useful. This breakthrough machine has a 4.7MHz clock and 16-256kbytes of RAM!

Cleve Moler received his bachelor's degree from Caltech in 1961, and a Ph.D. from Stanford University. He was a professor of mathematics and computer science at universities including University of Michigan, Stanford University, and the University of New Mexico. He has served as president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1997.
