Veteran actress, Joke Silva, moved swiftly on Sunday to dispel rumours of the passage of her husband, Olu Jacobs.

Jacobs, renowned for his illustrious career spanning decades in Nollywood and beyond, is 82.

He is often celebrated alongside his wife Joke Silva as one of Nollywood’s revered power couples, succumbed to undisclosed health complications.

His contribution to Nigerian and international cinema, including notable roles in Hollywood productions like ‘Ashanti’, has left an indelible mark on the industry.

There were reports on Sunday that the actor had passed, leading an outpouring of condolence messages on social media.

Responding to inquiries from PMNEWS on Sunday, Joke Silva emphatically stated that her husband is alive and in good health.

The family also released a video showing the ailing actor receiving a haircut.

This isn’t the first time such rumors have surfaced. Back in August 2022, Joke Silva had similarly refuted claims of Olu Jacobs’ demise through a statement on her Instagram story.

“Good day everyone, trust all is going well. The Jacobs clan would love to inform you that Papa J (Olu Jacobs MFR), is alive and well; enjoying himself as always in the comfort of his home and loved ones,” she wrote at the time.

The recent round of rumors prompted Nigerian writer and columnist Betty Irabor to also step in on Sunday, using her social media platforms to assure the public of Olu Jacobs’ well-being.

She urged people to disregard the false reports, reinforcing the message that the beloved actor is indeed alive.

In a recent interview with actress Nancy Isime, Silva candidly discussed her husband’s battle with dementia, revealing the profound impact it had on their lives.

She spoke of how his illness changed him significantly, yet affirmed her enduring love and admiration for the man she married 37 years ago.
