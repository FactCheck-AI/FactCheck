Two of the newest talented directors in Bollywood were involved in an ugly confrontation so much that they have decided to part ways. A Wednesday’s director Neeraj Pandey turned producer for a fast paced thriller and signed the director of The Stoneman Murders, Manish Gupta to direct the film. However though both of them began on a good note, they started having creative differences till a break-point where there was an ugly confrontation in Neeraj’s Andheri office.

Manish says, “Neeraj started interfering in the script. Initially, I didn’t mind it. But his interference increased so much that I lost my identity. I became so confused that I could hardly concentrate on it any longer. On Monday, when I told him that I would like to do it my way, he said ‘Tum bade badtameez insaan ho. And you dare not address me as ‘tum’. Call me ‘aap’. I was shocked and have still not recovered.”

Soon after, Manish apparently stormed out of Neeraj’s office, saying, “I am not doing Neeraj’s film anymore. Mujhse nahin hoga.” What is even more shocking is that Manish has decided not to return the signing amount of Rs. 5 lakh which Neeraj gave him as remuneration to direct the film. . “I am not returning Rs 5 lakh,” announces Manish, sticking to the fact that he was right.

Neeraj’s partner Sheetal Bhatia said, “Yes. Neeraj and I are going to produce films. As for Manish Gupta, we were in talks with him and were trying to put a project together. But we couldn’t finalise anything. I don’t want to say anything more on this.”
