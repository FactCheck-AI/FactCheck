Join author and translator Monika Zgustova in conversation with translator and writer Sabrina Jaszi on Zgustova’s new novel, A Revolver to Carry at Night – a captivating, nuanced portrait of the life of Véra Nabokov, who dedicated herself to advancing her husband Vladimir Nabokov’s writing career, playing a vital role in the creation of his greatest works.

Véra Nabokov was in many ways the epitome of the wife of a great man: keenly aware of her husband’s extraordinary talent, she decided to make his success her ultimate goal, throughout fifty-two years of marriage until his death in 1977. In a rich, sweeping novel, Monika Zgustova immerses us in the daily life of this remarkable couple, offering insights into their complex personal and professional relationships. Véra considered herself an independent woman, but was she really, when her husband took up so much space? And without Véra, could Vladimir Nabokov have become one of the twentieth century’s greatest writers?

This event is presented in partnership with the Mechanics’ Institute.

Praise for A Revolver to Carry at Night

“What a fascinating, intimate look into the complex marriage of Nabokov and his wife, Véra, the woman not only behind the man but making the man—without her, his masterpieces might not have been written. With elegant, precise language Zgustova creates a vivid, provocative portrayal of this passionate, enduring relationship. I couldn’t put it down.” —Jeanne Mackin, author of Picasso’s Lovers
