Artist Biography

Available in:

Kevin & Perry were fictional comedy characters played by Harry Enfield (Kevin) and Sandra Burke (Perry) - a couple of moody adolescents. Their only hit was The Precocious Brats feat. Kevin & Perry â€“ "Big Girl (All I Wanna Do Is Do It!)" which was taken from the movie "Kevin and Perry Go Large" which is British teen comedy film based on the Harry Enfield sketch Kevin the Teenager. The film was written by Dave Cummings and Harry Enfield and directed by Ed Bye. Enfield, Kathy Burke and Louisa Rix all return to their roles after previously appearing in Harry Enfield's Television Programme, and later Harry Enfield and Chums. James Fleet replaced Stephen Moore as Kevin's father. Although the film received mixed reviews upon release, it has since gained a cult following.

The single was in the top 40 for 4 weeks in 2000, and reached #16 in the UK Singles Charts.
