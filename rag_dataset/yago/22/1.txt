Legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan is still as smitten with his wife, Jaya Bachchan, as he was before their marriage. Amitabh and Jaya have been married for 40 years and their devotion to each other is a sign that the marital bond is still going strong.

Recently, Amitabh shared a picture of young Jaya Bachchan -- who was then a top actress and known as Jaya Bhaduri -- saying: “The wife, when she was not the wife...”

In the black and white picture, Jaya Bahaduri is looking every bit regal and graceful.
