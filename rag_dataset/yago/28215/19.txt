Biography

Christian IX came to the Danish throne in 1863 and ruled until 1906. He is the father of five European monarchs. King Christian IX and his wife Queen Louise of Hesse-Kassel were at their country residence when the Grants arrived but sent word of their plans for a state dinner to welcome the American couple to Denmark. The Grants were pleased with this courteous message as it saved them a trip to the country to call on the King and Queen.
