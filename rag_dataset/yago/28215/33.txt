I wanted to share this medal that doesn't fit in any other category. I believe it is Danish to celebrate Christian IX 50th wedding to his half-second cousin, Louise of Hesse-Kassel, a niece of Christian VIII on 26 May, 1892. The ribbon is spectacular and beautiful for being so old.

If anyone has further info please share, as I've never seen one like this or found any references on it.
