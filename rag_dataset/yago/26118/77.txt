Congratulations to the winners who got to see an advance screening of ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE!

William McGivern, Lisa Brindza, Chris Singleton, George Buck and Mary Ann Town!

ARTIE LANGE'S BEER LEAGUE, an over-the-top comedy about a group of misfits whose weekly softball games seem to have a lot more to do with getting into trouble than hitting home runs, combining beer, broads, and baseball for a home-run hit with plenty of hilarities. After a love enters his life, Artie decides to lead his team to victory, with tons of chaos along the way!

This movie is packed with non-stop laughter! So grab a cold one and play ball!
