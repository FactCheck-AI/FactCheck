Samuel Goldwyn Original U.S. One-Sheet Poster (27x41) Never Folded Fine Plus Condition

Original U.S. One-Sheet Poster for the Kenneth Branagh directed comedy PETER'S FRIENDS (1992) starring Branagh, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Richard Briers, Imelda Staunton, Tony Slattery, and, of course, Branangh's sidekick on those heady nineties days Emma Thompson. It's sort of a British Big Chill, if you will, but weaving the themes of friendship, love and jealousy, and general celebration. On this poster, which was used in a theater, you get to see the whole gang. The poster was never folded and we have graded it in fine plus condition. MovieArt does not sell reproductions.
