Director Michael Dowse's sequel to his heavy-metal comedy FUBAR picks up the story of Dean (Paul Spence) and Terry (Dave Lawrence) who take off on a road-trip looking for a paycheck and gigs. But when Terry meets a great woman and considers reordering his priorities, Dean refuses to give up his dreams of taking his band Night Seeker to the big time.
