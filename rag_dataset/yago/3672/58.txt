Online Service Provider Assessment Project

This project provides a standard means for testing online services and determining how they treat certain types of content and constituents.

AOL OSPA Project

The first online service provider to be surveyed by the OSPA project is America Online (AOL) and the first topic area was lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) content. Lots more work needs to be done to extend the report to other communities who may face bias, discrimination, or defamation. Help is also needed to produce a report that can be used in dialog with AOL and to keep our communities informed about AOL's policies and practices.
