The Adventures of Prince Achmed ( Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed in German) is the oldest animated feature film whose print is still available. It is a German fantasy animation movie released in the year 1926. This animated feature film was made using silhouette animation technique invented by it’s director, Lotte Reiniger. She used cardboard cutouts and thin lead sheet cutouts. Like shadow puppets she animated them frame by frame.

This animation is a fairytale which is loosely based on contents from the Arabian Nights specifically Aladdin and the story of Prince Ahmed and Peri Banu

Reiniger made the film from 1923 to 1926. She filmed each frame to make this film. So it was lierally a herculean task to film an entire movie of 65 minutes with 24 frames per sec. But she managed to do it.
