Starts out as your typical European fluff. Overly joyful and empty, but this biopic of Mozart does gradually turn darker and therefore a lot more rewarding. Just a shame it takes so long to get serious. This is a fine production under the supervision of the acclaimed Austrian German-based director Karl Hartl and it's clear they put some effort to portray the life of Mozart for the war audience.
