Where to Watch

Popular pinku eiga director Shuji Kataoka moved away from his violent S & M films of the 1980s with this erotic softcore melodrama about the transformation of a woman's soul. Saki Kurihara stars as a woman who gets into the prostitution business to pay a debt incurred by her lover, a married man who has been embezzling from his job. Kurihara is taken under the wing of the escort service's manager (Shiro Shimomoto), who teaches her that she must develop her acting skills if she is to be a success as a call girl. Eventually, she gets to be so good at faking emotional attachment to men that she even fools Shimomoto into proposing marriage.
