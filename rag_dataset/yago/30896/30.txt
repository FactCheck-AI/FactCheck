Who adopted one?

In this week’s Soaps.com’s Throwback poll we take readers back to November 2008 when Tina Lord found out her dog, David Vickers, was actually a female – and a pregnant one at that! Tina’s dog won the hearts of many in Llanview who couldn’t resist her cute face – not to mention the laugh they had over the fact that Tina named her after David Vickers.

Even though a jewelry appraiser asked how Tina had never noticed her dog squatted to pee, Tina admitted she had always been too preoccupied with all of the goings on around her to notice. Tina didn’t have the heart to part with any of the pups, but in the end allowed one to stay behind when she left Llanview.
