LâAtlantide

[Queen of Atlantis]

(1921)

Jacques Feyder directed this fantasy film of the not-so-mythical Atlantis, starring Jean Angelo, Stacia Napierkowska and Georges Melchior.

Of note is the cinematography of Victor Morin, AmÃ©dÃ©e Morrin and Georges Specht. Some shots rely on natural light from a logical source, eschewing fill lighting, leaving some actors pensively in silhouette to convey the sadness of the scene. Yet in another shot, one character is chosen for fill lighting while another is intentionally left dark. Saint-Avitâs convalescence in Paris and his memories of Africa as well as the story told by Bou-Djema are conveyed in an unusual overlapping of iris and fade transitions. Prior to the death of Capitaine Aymard, a vision of horror is executed in an impressive triple exposure. Whether shot in experimentation or by nessessity of situation, the cinematography is impressive in its expression.

This DVD edition, produced by Lobster Films, Paris, with its full-frame, natural-speed video transfer from very-good 35mm print materials, is generally pleasing viewing on high-definition television systems capable of upscaling the picture. The source print has a significant amount of dust and speckling, schmutz, frame jitters, emulsion chipping and scrapes, mild exposure fluctuations, and other print flaws.

The film is accompanied by a music score composed by Ãric Le Guen performed on piano and synthesizers. The music feels improvisational rather than composed but still conveys an appropriate atmosphere to the filmâs presentation.

We enthusiastically recommend this home video edition of the film.
