General Notes:

Bertrade and Fulk were married, and they became the parents of a son, Fulk, but in 1092 Bertrade left her husband and took up with King Philip I of France. Philip married her on 15 May 1092, despite the fact that they both had spouses living. He was so enamoured of Bertrade that he refused to leave her even when threatened with excommunication. Pope Urban II did excommunicate him in 1095, and Philip was prevented from taking part in the First Crusade. Astonishingly, Bertrade persuaded Philip and Fulk to be friends.

Bertrade married Count Fulk of Anjou IV, son of Count Geoffrey of Gâtinais and Ermengarde of Anjou. (Count Fulk of Anjou IV was born in 1043 in Château Landon, France 1 and died on 14 Apr 1109 in Angers, Anjou, , Rhône-Alpes, FRA 1.)

Bertrade next married King Philip of France I on 15 May 1092. (King Philip of France I was born on 23 May 1052 and died on 29 Jul 1108.)
