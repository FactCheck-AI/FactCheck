According to an announcement made by the Royal Palace, King Albert II of Belgium has finally met with daughter Princess Delphine again after many years. The Belgian Royal house released a photo of King Albert II and his wife Queen Paola meeting with Princess Delphine in their home Castle Belvédère in Laeken on 25 October.

The official announcement was as the following: "On Sunday 25 October a new chapter, rich of emotion, peace of mind, understanding and hope was begun. During our meeting in Castle Belvédère each of us, in serenity and empathy, managed to express their feelings and experiences. After the uproar, the suffering and the injuries, it is now time for forgiveness, healing and reconciliation. Together we have decided on this new path. This will take patience and effort, but we are determined. Delphine, Paola and Albert."

Princess Delphine is the daughter of King Albert II of Belgium, who abdicated in his son’s favour in 2013, and Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps. The Princess was recognised as King Albert’s daughter after a long legal battle.
