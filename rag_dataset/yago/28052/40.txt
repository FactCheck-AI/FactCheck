"Judith of Hohenstaufen, also known as Judith of Hohenstaufen or Judith of Swabia (c.&#8201;1133/1134 &#8211; 7 July 1191), a member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, was Landgravine of Thuringia from 1150 until 1172 by her marriage with the Ludovingian landgrave Louis II. She was baptized as Judith, but was commonly called Jutta or Guta. Sometimes the Latinate form Clementia was used, or Claritia or Claricia." - (en.wikipedia.org 29.10.2019)
