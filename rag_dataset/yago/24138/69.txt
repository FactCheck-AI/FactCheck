Biography

Amalie was the fourth child of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Caroline of Baden. She was the identical twin sister of Elisabeth Louise, later Queen of Prussia as wife of Frederick William IV of Prussia. Three other sisters married King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony, Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and Maximilian Joseph, Duke in Bavaria.

In 1851 Amalie Auguste became chairwoman of Women's Association of Dresden (Frauenverein zu Dresden), an organisation founded by her sister, the then queen. Three years later, her husband inherited the throne and she became queen. In 1859 she reorganized the association as the ZentralausschuÃ obererzgebirgischen und der vogtlÃ¤ndischen Frauenvereine and established a legal basis for it, under which the organisation continued until 1932.

A firm believer in divine-right absolute monarchy, the queen despised representative government and liberalism. Although she was an ultraconservative Catholic, it is unclear to what extent she was involved in the government's harsh persecution of Saxon Protestants in the 1860s, which included torture and long periods of incarceration. But later arrested by Willhim I who saw what she did in person for those crimes and tried and convicted by a jury for those crimes and Willhim acting as prosecutor and Bismarck as judge and she was sentenced life in prison without porale and she died in a custom jail in Dresden after a long illness from tuberculosis in Dresden.
