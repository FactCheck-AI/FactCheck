Released just a year after writer/director Clive Barker’s instantly iconic horror classic, Hellbound: Hellraiser II is one of those very rare sequels that approaches (and perhaps, at times, even surpasses) the quality and intensity of the original. Written by Barker’s friend and collaborator Peter Atkins, and directed by American filmmaker Tony Randel, the movie maintains the stylish, dark fantasy imagery of its predecessor and expands on the first film’s mythology. Picking up almost immediately after the conclusion of Hellraiser, Hellbound finds protagonist Kirsty Cotton (Ashley Laurence) hospitalized after losing her entire family to the demonic denizens of Hell known as the Cenobites. Unfortunately, she finds herself under the care of the sadistic Doctor Channard (Kenneth Cranham), whose penchant for the occult once again opens the gateway to Hell, allowing Pinhead (Doug Bradley) and his gang of mutilated masochists to seek vengeance against those who have escaped their clutches. - Text courtesy of the Colonial Theatre
