Why He Scares Us: With over 20 years experience as one of the world’s most prolific and popular authors of horror, praise from the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Stephen King and groundbreaking titles such as Hellraiser attached to his name, Clive Barker has reinvented the limits of horror again and again. While he’s only directed a handful of movies, many of his frightful stories have made it to the big screen, like Candyman and The Midnight Meat Train (2008), and he’s produced movies like Gods and Monsters (1998). To understand Barker’s impact on the world of horror, one doesn’t have to look far. It can be seen and echoed in the Jigsaw Killer from the Saw series who traps victims and takes pleasure in their pain and even in the bloodlust of a Tarantino movie. With Tortured Souls: Animae Damnatae, his first directing gig in 14 years, and a remake of Hellraiser on the way, now is a good time to catch up with Clive Barker.
