TORONTO – Canada’s Raven Banner Entertainment has optioned horror maven Clive Barker’s short story Jacqueline Ess: Her Will and Testament.

With Barker’s Seraphim Films to executive produce, the Canadian producer is developing a script for a $3 million movie based on the story about a beautiful woman who can horrifically change people’s body shapes simply with her mind.

“All of us at Raven Banner have been huge fans of Clive’s for years,” said Raven Banner managing partner Andrew Hunt in a statement on Wednesday.

A prolific novelist and artist, Barker has seen a host of past work adapted into movies. Barker directed 1987’s Hellraiser, based on his novella The Hellbound Heart, and adapted and directed Nightbreed from his short story Cabal in 1990.

“And I personally have always loved the story of Jacqueline Ess. It has all the qualities one wants in a modern horror film, so I’m excited to see it finally being brought to life on film,” Hunt added.

No word on who is adapting the short story for the movie, which will be shopped at the European Film Market in Berlin. Raven Banner has penciled in a fall 2014 production start in Ontario.
