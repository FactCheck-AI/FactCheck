Iconic British horror movie 'Hellraiser' is to be remade by Clive Barker, the writer and director of the original, it's emerged.

And perhaps better still, he's planning to get Doug Bradley, the actor who played Pinhead in the 1987 classic, to reprise his role as the pain-fixated demon.

On his Facebook page, Barker said: “A few weeks ago I had a very productive meeting with Bob Weinstein of Dimension Pictures, in the course of which I pitched a remake of the first 'Hellraiser' film.

“Today I have officially been invited to write the script based upon that pitch.”

He went on:

Dimension have been trying to get a reboot of the film for years. There has been previous talk of a TV series and even a PG version.

The first film was made for £600,000, making £9 million (around £21 million in today's money) and entering the horror movie canon.
