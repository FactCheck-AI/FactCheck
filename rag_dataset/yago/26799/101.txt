That’s a pretty bold statement for someone trying to tackle a franchise like Hellraiser, but producer/writer David Goyer is confident fans will really dig the new take on Hellraiser coming to Hulu.

The new take will be directed by David Bruckner(V/H/S,The Night House).

Bruckner’s Hellraiser is filming as you read this, with Odessa A’zion starring in one of the lead roles. Bruckner had recently called the film “something of a small reimagining,” while also teasing that the movie aims to stay as true as possible to The Hellbound Heart, the original Clive Barker novella that became the Barker-directed horror classic, Hellraiser.

David S. Goyer (The Dark Knight) is a writer/producer on the project, and in a new chat with Collider this week he teases the film’s “jaw dropping Cenobites” and more.

“I will say that we went back to the original novella for the source material, we’re really honoring Clive’s work,” Goyer tells the site, echoing David Bruckner’s recent comments.

Goyer adds, “I can say that David Bruckner is a genius. It’s filming right now. The footage is terrifying and amazing, and the Cenobites are jaw-dropping.”

We will have more updates as the come our way for this new flick. A Hellraiser series is also in the works for HBO MAX and Clive Barker is indeed involved in that one and will Executive Produce.
