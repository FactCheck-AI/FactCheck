They've got a little rascal on their hands! June Diane Raphael and husband Paul Scheer have welcomed their first child, a rep for Scheer confirms exclusively to Us Weekly. The couple's baby boy arrived on Wednesday, April 30.

"The family is really excited to get him ready to be a contestant on next season's Dancing With the Stars," the couple jokes.

Raphael, 34, and fellow comedian Scheer, 38, first met when Scheer offered to help the new mom and actress Casey Wilson with their comedy show, "Rode Hard and Put Away Wet," at Manhattan's Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2004.

"It was January and surprisingly warm," Scheer recalled of their first date to LA Weekly back in February 2013. "So we walked home together, and when I got to June's apartment, she went in for the kiss." The couple moved to L.A. the following year and tied the knot at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History in 2009.

"That was enough of a safety blanket for me," Scheer gushed about the New Girl guest star at the time. "June was already going and I didn't want to lose her."
