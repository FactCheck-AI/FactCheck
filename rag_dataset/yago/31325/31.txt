Sophie of Mecklenburg, also known as Sophia (December 18, 1481 – July 12, 1503) was a German noblewoman. She was a Duchess of Mecklenburg by birth and by marriage Electoral Princess of Saxony.

Sophie was the third of seven children and the second daughter of Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg and his wife Sophie of Pomerania, the daughter of Eric II of Pomerania-Wolgast (d. 1474) and his wife Sophia of Pomerania-Stolp (d. 1497).

On March 1, 1500, she married Prince Elector Johann of Saxony, the fifth of the seven children of Prince Elector Ernest of Saxony and Elisabeth of Bavaria. Johann and Sophie had a son together:

Johann Friedrich (1503–1554), succeeded his father as Prince-Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, married in 1527 to Sibylle of Cleves (1512–1554) who was the eldest daughter of Johann III of the House of La Marck, Duke of Jülich jure uxoris, Cleves, Berg jure uxoris, Count of Mark, also known as de la Marck and Ravensberg jure uxoris (often referred to as Duke of Cleves) who died in 1538, and his wife Maria, Duchess of Julich-Berg (1491–1543). Her younger sibling was Anne (later Queen of England) the wife of King Henry VIII.

Sophie died shortly after the birth of her son before her husband became Prince-Elector. She was buried in the city church of St. Mary in Torgau. Her bronze grave plate was crafted by Peter Vischer the Elder in his workshop in Nuremberg, after a design by Jacopo de’ Barbari.
