Biography

Rod Steiger was an American actor, noted for his portrayal of offbeat, often volatile and crazed characters.

Rodney Stephen Steiger was born on 14 April 1925 in Westhampton, Suffolk County, New York, USA and was the son of Lorraine Amelia "Amy" Augusta (Driver) and Frederick Jacob Steiger, Jr. (1897-c1984). His parents were a vaudevillian song and dance team who divorced when he was a year old. Afterward he was raised by his mother and stepfather. He had a difficult childhood, with an alcoholic mother from whom he ran away at the age of 16.

After serving in the South Pacific Theater during World War II, he began his acting career with television roles in 1947.

Ranked as "one of Hollywood's most charismatic and dynamic stars", he is closely associated with the art of method acting, embodying the characters he played, which at times led to clashes with directors and co-stars. Over his distinguished career he received three Academy Award nominations for his performances as ...

- title character Sol Nazerman in "The Pawnbroker" (1964)
