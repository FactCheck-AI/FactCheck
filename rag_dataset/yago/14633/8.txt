Notes:

1. Director Maurice Cloche was born at Commercy (Meuse, France) 17th June 1907. After being involved with various cinema arts projects. be began directing short documentaries like Versailles and this film in the early/mid 1930s. By 1937, he had moved into feature film production, many released to the cinema through Pathé-Natan, like "Ces Dames Aux Chapeaux Verts".

2. Director Maurice Cloche died 20th March 1990 at Bordeaux (Gironde, France).

3. This classic documentary gained many awards in various film festivals: Gold Medal at the Venice Biannual Exhibition 1935 Prize of the Internatinal Federation of Cinematographic Press at the 1935 Brussels International Fair - Festival of Cinema. Médaille dOr de lInstitut International du Cinéma Educatif, 1936

4. Different sources quote production dates of 1934 or 1935.

5. A film of a similar title is credited to Maurice Cloche around 1950, this is quite likely a re-issue, but I have currently seen neither.
