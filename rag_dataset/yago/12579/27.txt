I Drink Your Blood will be released on Blu-ray on November 8 via Grindhouse Releasing. A limited run of 3,000 copies will include a branded syringe prop, which can be pre-ordered from DiabolikDVD for $25.99.

The 1971 drive-in favorite is written and directed by David E. Durston and stars Bhaskar Roy Chowdhury, Jack Damon, and Lynn Lowry. Described as Night of the Living Dead meets the Manson Family, it was the first film to be rated X for violence.

Along with a host of extras, the two-disc set includes two additional vintage exploitation movies in high definition for the first time: Del Tenney’s I Eat Your Skin (1964) and Durston’s Blue Sextet (1969).
