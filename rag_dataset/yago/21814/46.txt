FILM SUMMARY

Profile of the Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk (crowned in 1941 - 2004), at the head of a country that has experienced colonization, the wars of the 20th century, the tragic period of the Khmers Rouges, with many film archives.

As Sihanouk is a film-maker himself, this documentary shoes numerous extracts from his feature films which have never been seen before and which, today, give invaluable insights into Cambodia’s history.

With the interviews of

* the King Norodom Sihanouk,

* the actual King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihamoni, Sihanouk’s son,

* the Queen Monique, Sihanouk's wife.

FILM PRESENTATION

Why not take an emotion-filled journey to Cambodia, the land of the Khmers? With the artistic explanation and participation of Norodom Sihamoni, the current King of Cambodia and son of Sihanouk.

Come with us and follow the life of the King of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, on the throne from 1941 to 2004, who describes his eventful reign in a country that lived through colonization, every 20th century war and the tragic Khmer Rouge era.

This film is also an opportunity to discover an unknown side to this unusual king: his passion for motion pictures.

King Sihanouk is the screenwriter, writer and the director of over 30 feature movies, and has passionately filmed his country. A number of never-before-seen excepts of his movies constitute today precious testimonials of Cambodia’s history, along with archive visuals of long-ago Asia.

The titles of Sihanouk’s films are poetic and evocative and all take us into the heart of the Khmer kingdom. There is “Aspara” with the presence of the current king’s sister, “The Little Prince”, with the future and current King of Cambodia in the title role and also “The Enchanted Forest” with King Sihanouk and his wife Monique.

The film shows Cambodia in its best and truest light.
