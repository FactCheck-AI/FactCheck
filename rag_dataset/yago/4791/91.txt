GODZILLA (1954)

[GOJIRA] [ゴジラ] Disturbed by underwater hydrogen bomb testing, an enormous, dinosaur-like sea-dwelling creature ventures onto the land, carving a path of death and destruction across Japan. A sci-fi/horror classic that also serves as a time capsule for 1950s nuclear anxiety, GODZILLA is the granddaddy of all monster movies, fueled by the creative synergies of director Ishirō Honda, special-effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya and composer Akira Ifukube. It spawned a decades-long franchise totaling nearly 40 films and countless imitators — but none have ever come close toppling the King of the Monsters. DIR/SCR Ishirō Honda; SCR Takeo Murata, from the novel by Shigeru Kayama; PROD Tomoyuki Tanaka. Japan, 1954, b&w, 96 min. In Japanese with English subtitles. NOT RATED
