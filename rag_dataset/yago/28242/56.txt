A moving and exquisite testament to one of the literary world’s most celebrated marriages: that of the greatest playwright of our age, Harold Pinter, and the beautiful and famous prize-winning biographer Antonia Fraser.

Based on Fraser’s recollections and the diaries she has kept since October 1968, Must You Go? is the story of a thirty-year marriage, beginning with their initial meeting when Fraser was the wife of a member of Parliament and Pinter was married to a distinguished actress, and ending with Harold’s tragic death after battling illness for many years. In between, we hear firsthand the joy of their love and partnership, as well as the mutual devotion both felt towards their work and the creative process. Courageous, powerful, and extraordinarily compelling, Must You Go? is a love story and a marvelously insightful account of the pleasures of married love.
