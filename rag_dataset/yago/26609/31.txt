A late 19th Century illustration of the marriage of Queen Isabella I of Castileand King Ferdinand II of Aragon, whose marriage and joint rule marked the de facto unification of Spain. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of Valladolid; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. It is generally accepted by most scholars that the unification of Spain can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella.
