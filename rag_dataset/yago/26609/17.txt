Profession: Queen of Castile

Biography: Isabella's marriage to Ferdinand II of Aragon created the partnership of the 'Catholic Monarchs', and their union helped lead directly to the eventual unification of Spain. In office she reorganized the government, lowered considerably the crime rate and had the Kingdom relieved of its debt.

Together with her husband they sponsored Christopher Columbus' 1492 voyage where he discovered the New World and completed the Reconquista by annexing Granada, ending centuries of Muslim rule over areas in the Iberian peninsula. She also formed the Spanish Inquisition with her husband, initially to find and punish heretics among the Muslims and Jews who had converted to Catholicism and to maintain orthodox Catholicism within their empires.

Their grandson, King Charles V, would eventually reunify Spain based on their marriage and claims.
