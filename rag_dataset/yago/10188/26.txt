Avid EastEnders fans, and those old enough, will remember when the Jackson family moved into Albert Square.

The year was 1993 when Carol (Lindsey Coulson) and Alan (Howard Antony) rolled-up to the East End with their children Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), Robbie (Dean Gaffney) and Billie (Devon Anderson) in tow.

Where does the time go, eh?!

Over the past few decades, the family has expanded as the Jackson kids have all grown up to have their own children making the brood a permanent fixture in Walford.

And who can forget, they are an extension to the Branning and Beale family (more about that in the quiz!).

Plus, Dot Cotton also married into the family after she found romance in Carol Jackson's father later on in life.

There's so much to know about the Jacksons that we could be going through their family history until the cows come home.

Good luck!
