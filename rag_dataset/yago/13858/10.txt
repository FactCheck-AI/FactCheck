Bryce Dallas Howard admitted she is 'more in love than ever' as she took to Instagram to celebrate her wedding anniversary with Seth Gabel on Saturday.

The Jurassic World actress, 41, couldn't contain her happiness as she praised her husband, 40, on her social media page.

The star beamed as she looked at Seth wearing a glamorous patterned maxi dress which she cinched in at the waist with a matching material belt.

The American actress put on a loving display as she placed her hand on the actors lap.

Bryce cut a stylish figure as she waved her stunning red tresses as they cascaded past her shoulders.

She opted for a radiant palette of makeup including a smoky eyeshadow and a stunning pink lipstick.

Seth looked dapper in a beige jacket over a blue patterned shirt which he teamed with dark blue jeans.

She captioned the snap to her 2.4million followers: 'Seth Gabel, we celebrate 16 years of marriage today and I am more in love with you now than ever. Happy Anniversary. Love,‚Å£ Your Wife.'

Howard met her future husband while the two were attending New York University. They dated for five years before marrying in 2006.

The couple have two children together: Theodore Howard-Gabel, 15, and Beatrice Howard-Gabel, 10.

Despite her busy personal life, the star has still been hard at work on her career in recent years.

She's completed filming on Jurassic World Dominion, the third installment in the Jurassic World trilogy.

Howard will reprise her role as Claire Dearing, the former park operations manager of Jurassic World.

Her other upcoming film, titled Argylle is currently in post-production. Argylle centers around a spy of the same name as he travels all over the world on a mission.

Howard will star in the film alongside Henry Cavill, John Cena and Samuel L. Jackson.
