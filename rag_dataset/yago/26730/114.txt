The Royal Abbey of Santa Maria de Poblet (Catalan: Reial Monestir de Santa Maria de Poblet), Catalonia. Founded by the Order of Cistercians in 1151, the monastery serves as a royal pantheon of the Crown of Aragon kings as well. The kings and queens of Aragon were buried there from Alfonso II (in 1196) to John II (1479). Notable figures buried there include Peter IV (and his first three wives, Maria of Navarre, Eleanor of Portugal and Eleanor of Sicily), John I (and his wives, Martha of Armagnac and Violant of Bar), Ferdinand I (and his wife, Eleanor of Albuquerque) and the Hungarian queen Beatrice of Naples. A bright example of the Cistercian architecture, the monastery boasts the altar by Damian Forment dating from 1527. Following a long period of disrepair and ruin in the 19th century, the monastery was refounded in 1940 by Italian monks. Extensive and thorough reconstruction began soon after that. It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1991 [May 19, 2017].
