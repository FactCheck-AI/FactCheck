Beautiful Princess Marie Louise of Schaumburg-Lippe who was married to Prince Friedrich Sigismund of Prussia.

She was the eldest grandchild of King Frederick VIII of Denmark and his wife Princess Lovisa of Sweden.

Princess Marie Louise's life was traumatic, she was born in Sopron,Hungary on February 10, 1897, the eldest daughter of Prince Frederick of Schaumburg-Lippe and his first wife Princess Louise of Denmark. She had two siblings, Prince Christian and Princess Stephanie. Her parents marriage was unhappy and her mother died in 1906 when Marie Louise was only 9 years old.

When Marie Louise was 12 years old, her father remarried to a distant relative,Princess Antoinette Anna of Anhalt, becoming two half-brothers. During World War I at the tender age of 19, she married Prussian Prince Friedrich Sigismund (1891-1927) whose aunt was German Empress Augusta.

She was a passionate rider who showed a lot of understanding for the interests of her husband. The couple had two children:

Princess Louise of Prussia (1917-2009)

Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia (1919-2006)

After World War I, Prince Friedrich Sigismund decided to go horse riding and trained as a dressage and cross-country rider. In 1924 he was considered the champion of German tournament sports. He was supposed to represent Germany at the 1928 Summer Games in Amsterdam. On the day of an Olympic dressage test in Lucerne, he suffered a fatal riding accident. Marie-Louise was a successful rider in the 1920s. The former Diringshofen villa on Lehnitzsee was chosen as a domicile for Friedrich Sigismund. After the accident, his widow chose the house in Neu Fahrland as her permanent residence for herself and her two children.

While working in the morning with the Trakehner Posidonius, Friedrich Sigismund fell so unhappily while jumping over a moat that he died on July 6, 1927, despite a quick emergency operation in Lucerne. He was buried in the family grave in the park of Klein Glienicke.
