Princess Louise of Denmark (Louise Caroline Josephine Sophie Thyra Olga) (17 February 1875 – 4 April 1906) was a member of the Danish royal family who became a princess of Schaumburg-Lippe by marriage.

The third child and oldest daughter of King Frederik VIII and his wife, Queen Louise, Princess Louise grew up in Copenhagen as a Danish princess. Known for her shy and quiet personality, Louise remained a low-key member of the royal family throughout her life. In 1896, she married her second cousin Prince Friedrich of Schaumburg-Lippe who belonged to a cadet branch of the German princely house of Schaumburg-Lippe and was heir to the lordship of Náchod in Bohemia. After the wedding, she moved with him to Bohemia where she died in 1906, aged only 31.
