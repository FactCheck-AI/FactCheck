This documentary displays the dilapidated state of the former 20th Century hutong residence of Mr. Liang Sicheng and his wife Ms. Lin Huiyin in Beijing. The couple was among Chinaâ€™s most famous art and architecture experts, particularly in exploring Chinese ancient architecture. The former residence, badly damaged by a real estate development project, is a valuable cultural heritage symbol that once belonged to people who made influential contributions to Chinese art and architecture throughout their lifetimes.
