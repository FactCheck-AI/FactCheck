The deed is done, and Hollywood’s best-known bad boy is single no more.

After being known for years as a hard-drinking playboy, actor Russell Crowe married his long-time sweetheart, Australian singer-actress Danielle Spencer, Monday in a traditional ceremony.

Reuters reports Crowe, who celebrated his 39th birthday the same day, exchanged vows with Spencer, 32, inside a specially built domed chapel on his 800-acre ranch at Nana Glen, 250 miles north of Sydney on Australia’s east coast.

The bride wore a floor-length, figure-hugging, satin Armani dress with a plunging back, high split and spaghetti straps, according to Reuters. The gown was entirely covered by cream-colored lace embroidered with ivory and silver pearls. Spencer also wore a translucent organza veil and satin sandals.

“She was very friendly, smiling, and looked just like a princess,” Dutch fan Anneloes Derks told Reuters, as some 30 locals cheered Spencer’s arrival on Monday afternoon.

Guards kept watch over the Oscar-winning actor’s property to stop paparazzi from intruding on the private affair, Reuters reports. There were, however, roughly 20 photographers and cameraman staked out alongside the narrow two-lane country road, trying to get any glimpse of the couple and complained that logging trucks going past on the road caused dust and dirt to fly up and cloud their lenses.

Crowe‘s wedding celebrations have already been going for three days, Reuters reports, kicking off on Friday with a party and light show, followed by a Saturday cricket match on a specially built pitch. At the reception, the Oscar-winner took to the stage with his band Thirty Odd Foot of Grunts to rock on into the evening.
