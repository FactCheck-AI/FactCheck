More than 20 years after the couple met playing lovers in the 1990 movie The Crossing, Russell Crowe and Danielle Spencer may not have their Hollywood happy ending after all. Married in April 2003, the New Zealand-born Oscar winner, 48, and his Aussie musician wife, 43, are reportedly no longer together, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Crowe's rep has not responded to People's request for comment. The couple's apparent split comes after rumors of a rocky romance swirled over the summer. In June, Spencer was photographed out at a Sydney casino lounge with Damian Whitewood, her pro dance partner on season 12 of Australia's Dancing with the Stars.
