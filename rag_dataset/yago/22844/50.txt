Talk about pedigree! The East Hampton Village home of Dina Merrill, who was the daughter of uber-socialite, Marjorie Merriweather Post, and Edward Francis Hutton, of EF Hutton fame, has been sold posthumously for $8.2 million. She was also the cousin “poor little rich girl” Barbara Hutton, whose antics filled the pages of many a tabloid.

The $8.2 million purchase of the West Dune Lane estate happened a year after Merrill’s death last year at age 93 and was by the daughter from Merrill’s her first marriage, Nedenia Rumbough, and Donald Handelman.

Merrill, herself, was no slouch. Her acting career brought her to Broadway and Hollywood and she was a highly active philanthropist. Because of her thespian career, she changed her name from Nedenia Hartley to the more easily digestible Dina Merrill. Her second marriage was to the celebrated actor, Cliff Robertson, who was a resident of Water Mill when he died in 2011. She also owned Mar-a-Lago before Donald Trump took possession, and played host to such celebrities as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.
