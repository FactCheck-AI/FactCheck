Just wanted to share my excitement with you all.

Excitement of having watched a super-lovely for the first time last night.

'MOHAN JOSHI HAZIR HO!' (1984) Although it was a terrible print on YouTube; once I started the lovely film directed by Saeed Akhtar Mirza, I couldn't stop it.

It is written in such an awesome manner by the likes of Sudhir Mishra sir, Yusuf Mehta and Saeed sir himself; all the characters are so relate-able and realistic.

And of course what a wonderful cast it had. And it is edited in such a crisp manner. I loved it! I learned from it!

I think all us 'wannabee' filmmakers must start our learning with watching all these Indian 'parallel' classics.

My rating: 9/10 ********* M U S T . W A T C H . F I L M.
