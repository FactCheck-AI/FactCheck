Cura Deuda, a 100% Mexican fintech, announced a funding round of $1.3M led by Magma Partners and Anteris. They launched in 2011, and have been revolutionizing credit repair in the country since then.

Cura Deuda offers free legal and financial advice, as well as a personalized plan for its users. They act as an intermediary between debtor and creditor, and create a strategy to help recover their users’ score faster. This helps reintegrate them into the credit system.

“We created Cura Deuda to help people pay off their debt with a discount of around 70% of what they owe. A lot of people want to liquidate their debts, but they don’t have the capacity or the knowledge to do so. That’s why we also offer a savings plan, which is the most efficient way for Mexicans to pay off their debt”.

Javier Ruiz Galindo, co-founder and co-CEO of Cura Deuda.

With the $1.3 million funding round from Magma and Anteris, the fintech plans to further develop their technology and expand their services to Latin America.

“We strongly believe that to reach financial freedom you first have to pay off your debt. So this is the first product of many to come.”
