In the opening episode of Strictly, Greg and Karen performed an American Smooth and Greg revealed that he showed Emma, well-loved for her roles such as Nanny McPhee, a sneak peek before the show.

Speaking on Strictly It Takes Two he said: "The evening before the show, I said to Em would you like to watch a little video that Karen took off the monitor of the last dress rehearsal."

"She watched it and burst into tears, good tears I was told! Which I think took the sting out of it slightly on the Saturday night."

Before this he had not shown or told Emma and his family anything about what he was doing on the show, he said: "I didn't pass anything by them, at all."

Greg and Emma have been together since 1995 after they met on the film set of Sense and Sensibility. They married in 2003 and later that year they adopted a Rwandan orphan Tindyebwa Agaba.

Strictly It Takes Two is on every weeknight from 6:30 PM on BBC2.
