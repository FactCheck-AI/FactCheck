The association Art, culture et foi Paris organizes, in partnership with Lobster Films and with the technical resources of AROSS, a concert of improvisations by Sophie-Véronique Cauchefer-Choplin, assistant organist of the great organ of Saint-Sulpice, on “Crainquebille“, silent movie by Jacques Feyder.

Adapted from the short story of Anatole France, Feyder signs with “Crainquebille” (1922 – 76 mn) a film criticizing the judicial institution. The four-season merchant Crainquebille, played by the Belle Epoque great actor Maurice de Féraudy, finds himself in the hands of justice for an insignificant affair. But providence watches over him… Despite its serious subject matter, Feyder’s film, inventive and full of fantasy, is also a precious document on popular Paris at the start of the 1920s.

Note: entry to this concert requires to purchase a ticket.
