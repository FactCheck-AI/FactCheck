Based on a novella by Anatole France, director Feyder’s poetic masterpiece details the life of peddler Crainquebille (the magnificent Maurice de Féraudy), who is arrested because of a ridiculous misunderstanding. After leaving jail, his life is upended when once-faithful customers shun him. Brilliantly told with humor and compassion.

Crainquebille was restored by Lobster Films in 2019 with the support of the CNC (Centre National du Cinéma et de l’Image animée), from five original elements: a few fragments of the original camera negative and 14 cans of trims and outtakes preserved by the Cinémathèque Française, an abridged nitrate print in the CNC collection, a nitrate print from the Danish Film Institute, a safety fine grain and an original 17.5mm diacetate print in the Lobster Collection. Tinting and toning were recreated according to the handwritten inscriptions on the original negative, and the few surviving original prints. Intertitles were recreated according to the original nitrate flash titles, the translation of foreign prints, and the Swedish censorship cards of the original release.
