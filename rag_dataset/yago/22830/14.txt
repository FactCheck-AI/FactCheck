This is an original, one-sheet movie poster from 1972 for the film J.W. Coop starring Cliff Robertson, Geraldine Page, Cristina Ferrare, R.G. Armstrong, and R.L. Armstrong. Robertson also directed the cowboy drama.

The poster measures 27” x 41” and is in good to very good condition with some tape residue along the top-white edge and minor wear and creasing along the edges. There is a Canadian censor stocker on the bottom-right and the U.S. rating box has been partially covered with tape. It was folded at the time of printing. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters.

Please look closely at the photos (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This collectible poster, printed in 1972 to promote the theatrical release of J.W. Coop, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
