"Gattu is the first film that CFSI is releasing commercially. We also have a Kannada and an animation film coming up. Gattu will be a gate opener for all of them," Nandita told reporters Friday at the launch of Gattu's promotional song - Laga le pech.

The film, starring Mohammas Samad as Gattu, has been directed by Rajan Khosa of Dance of the Wind fame.

Revealing the story, Khosa said that the film is about a nine-year-old street boy who is obsessed with flying kites. "He wants to cut this black kite called Kali and for this he needs a high roof. He realises that the school has one and pretends to go to the school and wins the heart of all children," he added.

Director-producer Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is supporting Gattu and says that the entertaining and wonderful story will take viewers back to their childhood days.

"I am proud that I am associated with Gattu. I will do whatever I can to support the film," said Mehra.

"The film is about the have and have-not and the right to education. It is about all of us. I am sure it will be a lovely movie and I want to give it my entire support. Lower the budget, more are the challenges. The film seems entertaining and the story is wonderful. Let's revisit our childhood through this film," he added.

Laga le pech has been sung by Shubha Mudgal and child artists of Gattu. Lyrics are by Khosa and Ankur Tiwari and Sandesh Shandilya has composed it.
