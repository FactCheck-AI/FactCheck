Tom and Rita's paths first crossed on the set of the ABC sitcom "Bosom Buddies", in which Tom starred as a cross-dressing advertising agent. Tom was actually married to his college sweetheart, the late Samantha Lewes, at the time. In 1987, Hanks and Lewes divorced and a year later, Rita Wilson and Tom Hanks were married. The couple have two sons, Chester and Truman and Hanks also has two children from his previous marriage, Colin and Elizabeth Hanks.
