Ola Rapace has been added to the cast of the 23rd James Bond film Skyfall.

The announcement was made on the project's official Twitter page on Monday (November 7).

Ola, who is the husband of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo's Noomi Rapace, will have an unknown role in Skyfall alongside stars Daniel Craig, Javier Bardem and Judi Dench.

BÃ©rÃ©nice Marlohe was recently confirmed as the new Bond girl for Skyfall.

Sam Mendes will direct the film. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney also star. Harris said at last week's Skyfall press conference that she is "raring to go" on the new movie, which starts filming later this year.

Skyfall will open in cinemas on October 26, 2012.
