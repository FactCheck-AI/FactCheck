When former First Lady Nancy Reagan passed away this past Sunday at age 94, it officially marked an end to a lasting romance that once lit up the White House. SEE IT: Inaugural Balls Through the Years The wife of the late Ronald Reagan first met her future husband — and 40th President of the United States — at Hollywood restaurant LaRue’s over dinner set up by director Mervyn LeRoy. Known then as aspiring actress Nancy Davis, she was described as "immediately smitten" by then-film star Ronnie. And after meeting in the 1940s and then reconnecting in 1950, they married on March 4, 1952, beginning a union that would last until Reagan’s death at age 93 in 2004 from Alzheimer’s. Throughout their marriage, Ronald wrote "countless letters to his wife," while Nancy "left cards and love notes around for her husband to discover" when the two couldn't be together. "I more than love you, I’m not whole without you." wrote Ronald on their 31st wedding anniversary. "You are life itself to me. When you are gone, I’m waiting for you to return so I can start living again.” There was also the gaze, or the look of utter adoration Nancy would give to her beau in public, reminding the world of her devotion. "He was all I had ever wanted in a man, and more," She wrote in her 1989 memoir "My Turn."
