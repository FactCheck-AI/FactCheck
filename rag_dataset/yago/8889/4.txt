Description:

Boston-native Ann Smith Franklin married James Franklin (brother of founding father Benjamin Franklin) in 1723. They established the first independent newspaper in New England, the New England Courant. The Franklins later moved to Newport, Rhode Island, and founded that colonyâ€™s first newspaper. Ann set type, ran the press, and sold the newspapers and books they published. When James died in 1735, leaving her with five small children, she took over the business and successfully petitioned to become the official printer for the colony.
