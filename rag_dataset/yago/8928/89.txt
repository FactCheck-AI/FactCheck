I saw "PROXIMA" at the special screening at Huelva, with very bad sound conditions. But I should also say that it is a very captivating film, with a perfect rhythm (quite slow, but as Wenders said once: "if you are not in a hurry"...), and exceptional actors and music. There are very few sci-fi films in Spain, and sure this is the best one, and a film comparable with any sci-fi foreign film. The most important things in this movie are not visual effects, but an intelligent screenplay that suggests multiple meanings. Atanes has repeated his challenge of mix sci-fi and philosophy, as he done with "FAQ". Of course, that's not digestible for all the audiences, though I think "PROXIMA" is also an amusing and sometimes brilliant film.
