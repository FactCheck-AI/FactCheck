Mexico City, Aug 14 (EFE). — Actress Columba Dominguez, an emblematic figure of the golden age of Mexican cinema, has died in a Mexico City hospital. She was 85.

The star of films such as “Maclovia” (1948), “Rio Escondido” (1948) and “Pueblerina” (1949) died Wednesday but the family kept private the cause of her death.

Dominguez, the wife and muse of Mexican director Emilio “Indio” Fernandez, in 2013 received an Ariel, Mexican film’s top award, in recognition of her career.

Born in Guaymas, Sonora, on March 4, 1929, Dominguez was one of the key figures of the golden age of Mexican film for her roles in works directed by Fernandez, with whom she had a daughter before the couple split up in 1952.

She was directed by Luis Buñuel in the 1955 film “El rio y la muerte” (The River and Death), by Fernando Mendez in “Ladron de cadaveres” (1957) and by Ismael Rodriguez in “Los hermanos del hierro” (1961) and “Animas Trujano” (1962).

She also took part in soap operas such as “La tormenta” (1967), “El carruaje” (1972) and “Aprendiendo a amar” (1979), and after her retirement from acting she made a name for herself as a painter.
