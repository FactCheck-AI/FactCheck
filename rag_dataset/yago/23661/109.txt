It does not seem all that strange to us today that Prince George of Denmark served as an unofficial male consort to his wife Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs in Britain, during the first decade of the eighteenth century. After all, for nearly 60 years we have grown accustomed to Prince Philip of Greece, the duke of Edinburgh, walking dutifully but not quite so comfortably behind his wife Elizabeth II, a queen who reigns serenely without any apparent need for a king by her side, even though she has a husband whom she clearly loves and cherishes. The dukeâ€™s role is singular, highly visible, and ultimately essential to the maintenance of the monarchy, but it nonetheless remains an informal one, something akin to an American first lady, or gentleman, should we Americans ever elect a woman as our president.
