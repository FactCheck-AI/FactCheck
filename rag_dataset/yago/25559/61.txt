NEW YORK - The actress and opera singer who likely had her greatest impact on TV audiences as Marion Kerby "the ghostess with the mostess" in the 1950s TV series "Topper," has died. Anne Jeffreys was 94.

Jeffreys's manager Don Gibble says the actress died peacefully in her sleep Wednesday evening.

In "Topper," she and her real-life husband Robert Sterling starred as fun-loving husband and wife George and Marion Kerby who, after dying in a Swiss avalanche, return as ghosts to their mansion and comically haunt its new occupant. Each week she was introduced to viewers as "the ghostess with the mostess."

It was just one of many varied roles in a long career in films, television, opera and on Broadway for Jeffreys. Her final screen appearance was on HBO's series "Getting On."
