Robin Wright Penn and husband of 13 years, Sean Penn, filed legal separation papers on Friday. It’s not the first time the couple has had marital troubles. The couple filed for separation in December 2007 but reconciled in April 2008.

Rumors of Wright and Penn’s possible relationship troubles started at the Academy Awards earlier this year where Sean Penn won Best Actor for his role in “Milk.” Even though Robin Wright Penn was by his side all night, Sean didn’t even mention his wife in his acceptance speech or to the press.

Entertainment news show “Extra” got the exclusive, saying:

“Extra” has exclusively learned that Sean Penn filed for “legal separation with minor children” from wife Robin Wright Penn on Friday, April 24th, 2009, according to a court record.

Robin Wright and Penn were married April 27, 1996, and have two children, Dylan and Hopper Jack.
