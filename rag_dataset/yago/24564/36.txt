(28 June 1963 - 1965) (divorced)

Ex-husband Burt Reynolds invited Judy as his guest the first time he guest-hosted "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson" (1962) in the early 70s. They hadn't spoken in six years.

While on a promotional tour for the TV series "Fair Exchange" (1962) Judy met Burt Reynolds. After a six-month courtship the two were married on June 28th 1963. The marriage lasted but two years. She never asked for alimony. Reynolds would be there for her in later years when she was dealing with financial woes amid her drug problems.
