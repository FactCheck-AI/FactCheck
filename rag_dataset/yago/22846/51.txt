The Grand Duke was the youngest son of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and Maria Feodorovna (nee Princess Dagmar of Denmark). He was a younger brother of Tsar Nicholas II.

Michael caused a commotion at the imperial court when he took Natalia Sergeyevna Wulfert, a married woman, as a lover. The couple had one child named George who was born in 1910. The couple married in 1912.

When Nicholas abdicated in March 1917 Michael was named as his successor instead of the Tsarevich Alexei. Michael, however, deferred acceptance of the throne until ratification by an elected assembly. He was never confirmed as Emperor, and following the Russian Revolution of 1917, he was imprisoned and murdered.
