Mila Kunis hinted back in March that she and former That ’70s Show co-star Ashton Kutcher were married, but now it’s apparently official: The two wed over the weekend, People reports.

Kunis and Kutcher were on That ’70s Show together from its 1998 beginning to its 2006 conclusion, but didn’t start dating until 2012 (Kutcher was married to Demi Moore from 2005 to 2013). They got engaged in 2014, and Kunis gave birth to their first daughter later that year.
