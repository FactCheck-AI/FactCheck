Junior Ray Merrell, known to many as Ray or Papa Ray to his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, peacefully left this world on February 11, 2024, surrounded by the love of his family. Born on March 2, 1929, in Oak Hill, Kentucky, he was the cherished son and eighth child of Lewis Merrell and Mossie Lee Barber Merrell. He was a man of Christ with a deep Christian faith and dedicated to his Baptist beliefs throughout his life.

Ray was one of fourteen siblings, and the last living child of Lewis and Mossie Merrell. Each sibling and their families held a special place in his heart. Ray’s siblings were Raymond Lee Merrell, Carl Ceman Merrell, Edward Lewis Merrell, Lorraine Merrell, Paul Daniel Merrell, Lewis Dewey Merrell, Monroe Lee Merrell, Marvin Speed Merrell, Lola Mae Merrell, Marlin Dee Merrell, Chapman Donald Merrell, Pauline Merrell and Waffrieda Merrell.

In a testament to love that endured a lifetime, Ray was married to his beloved wife, Betty Sue Ledford Merrell, for an incredible 73 years. Together, they built a family rooted in love and faith. His children, Linda Gail Merrell Turner and Philip Ray Merrell, have continued his legacy with their own beautiful families.

Linda Gail Merrell Turner and Gary Turner (deceased), along with their children, Scott Mitchell Turner (son Ryder Philip Turner) and Tiffany Lynn Turner Groves (husband Thomas Groves, daughter Alexandria Groves), hold cherished memories of Ray’s love and guidance.

Philip Merrell and Alexandra Maria (Sandy) Dais Merrell, along with their children, Dr. Laura Kathleen Merrell, Brian Ray Merrell, Jared Dean Merrell (wife Karissa Davis Merrell, daughter Mackenzie, son Jamison), and Zoe Elaine Triantis (fiancé Caleb Harris), also honor his memory with love and gratitude.

Ray was a man of many talents and passions. His professional journey saw him excel as an appliance repairman and a small business owner specializing in household appliances. Beyond work, Ray found joy in fishing, hunting, country dancing, gardening, and sharing laughter and fellowship over card games with his beloved brothers and sisters.

Ray’s presence will be deeply missed, but his legacy of love, faith, and family will forever endure. His spirit will continue to live on in the hearts of those who were fortunate enough to know and love him.

In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Ray’s name, to the Linda E. White Hospice House, 611 Harriet Street, Evansville, Indiana 47710.

May he rest in eternal peace, and may his memory be a blessing to us all.
