Directed by Rod Lurie, The Contender details the controversy that erupts after Jeff Bridges’ President Jackson Evans selects Joan Allen’s Laine Hanson to be his new V.P. – with the selection raising the ire of an ultra conservative congressman named Sheldon Runyon (Gary Oldman). Filmmaker Lurie, armed with his own screenplay, delivers a slightly overlong yet mostly compelling drama that benefits substantially from the superlative efforts of its various actors, as Allen’s top-notch portrayal of the sympathetic protagonist is matched (and heightened) by Bridges’ loose, charming performance and Oldman’s hypnotic turn as the far-from-one-dimensional villain – with, as well, Lurie eliciting first-class work from an eclectic supporting cast that includes Sam Elliott, William Petersen, and Christian Slater. The progressively absorbing narrative goes a long way towards smoothing over the periodic bumps along the way, and it’s clear, too, that The Contender‘s slick visuals and smattering of palpably electrifying sequences, including a spellbinding, emotional debate between Hanson and Runyon about abortion, pave the way for a thoroughly satisfying closing stretch – which effectively cements the picture’s place as a stirring endeavor that does, at times, work best as a showcase for several admittedly enthralling performances.
