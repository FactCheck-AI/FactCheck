"They will believe - because we will spread that sh*t like Nutella." The first trailer for indie comedy Struck by Lightning, written by and starring Golden Globe winning Glee star Chris Colfer, directed by Brian Dannelly of Saved!, has arrived from E! Online (via AICN). The film is about a high school kid who recounts the way he blackmailed his classmates into contributing to his literary magazine. It has a very John Hughes plus Election kind of vibe, and looks good, but some of the lines are a bit textbook. The cast includes Sarah Hyland, Dermot Mulroney, Christina Hendricks, Rebel Wilson and Allison Janney. Take a look!

A personal raincloud can be deadly. After being struck and killed by lightning, high school student Carson Phillips recounts the way he blackmailed his fellow classmates into contributing to his literary magazine.

Struck by Lightning is directed by German-born filmmaker Brian Dannelly, of the indie comedy Saved! and mostly TV work recently, from a screenplay written by Chris Colfer, making his breakout in writing, as he stars on Glee as Kurt Hummel and stars in and produced this, too. It was produced by Permut Presentations and Camellia Entertainment, but we're not sure of a release date, sometime this year, stay tuned. Thoughts?
