The 2006 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival will run from June 30 through July 8 in the spar town of Karlovy Vary in Eastern Bohemia, Czech Republic. This category A festival, which drew over 140,000 moviegoers in 2005, will present a selection of 230 feature films, including 28 French productions (61 screenings).

“L’Enfant d’une autre” by Virginie Wagon, selected in the Official Competition, will be screened Tuesday, July 4 at 6 p.m. in the presence of the director and lead actress, Catherine Jacob, as well as the French Ambassador to the Czech Republic.

“Angel-A” will be presented in a Czech Premiere in the presence of Luc Besson on July 4 (with its commercial release slated for July 6).

The actress Catherine Jacob and the director Lorraine Lévy will present “The First Time I Was Twenty,” screened as part of a retrospective section titled Visions of Seven, dedicated to seven French directors whose films deal with the theme of adolescence and the search for identity. The six remaining films in this section are “Les Cousins” (“The Cousins”) by Claude Chabrol (1959), “L’Argent de poche” (“Small Change”) by François Truffaut (1976), “La meilleure façon de marcher” (“The Best Way to Walk”) by Claude Miller (1975), “Les Roseaux sauvages” (“The Wild Reeds”) by André Téchiné (1994), “La vie ne me fait pas peur” (“Life Doesn’t Scare Me” aka “I’m Not Afraid of Life”) by Noémie Lvovsky (1999), and “Les Amants réguliers” (“Everyday Lovers”) by Philippe Garrel (2004).

Natacha Régnier will introduce “Sunduk Predkov” (“L’été d’Isabelle”) by Nurbek Egen, presented in competition in the “East of the West” section along with Lucas Belvaux’s film “La Raison du plus faible” (“The Right of the Weakest”), which was showcased at Cannes this year. The director Brice Cauvin will present his film “De particulier à particulier” (“Hotel Harabati”), screened as part of the Variety Critics’ Choice. Christian Vincent will present the comedy “Quatre étoiles” and Daniel Duval will accompany his new film “Le temps des porte-plumes.”

This strong French presence at Karlovy Vary will add impetus to the healthy position of French cinema in the Czech Republic. The 24 French films distributed in this territory in 2005 attracted close 600,000 spectators and captured over 6% of the market (doubling the previous year’s share).
