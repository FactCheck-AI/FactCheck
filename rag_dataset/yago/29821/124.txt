WHEN there’s smoke, there’s fire. Just a week after we wrote that their marriage had turned sour, model and “Top Chef” hostess Padma Lakshmi, 36, split from her husband of three years, “Satanic Verses” author Salman Rushdie, 60. His rep announced yesterday, “Salman Rushdie has agreed to divorce his wife, Padma Lakshmi, because of her desire to end their marriage.” Sources told Page Six the “desire” was stoked by Lakshmi’s close friendship with an unidentified billionaire – and she was also seen recently getting close with a well-known chef at the Rose Bar. Her rep tried to downplay the decision, saying, “[Lakshmi] has agreed with [Rushdie] to end their marriage. After an eight-year relationship, Lakshmi regrets that their mutual efforts failed to make the marriage work.” Both parties asked for “privacy at this time.” Rumors of a rift had been swirling for months, but had always been denied – either through the couple’s flacks or their lawyers.
