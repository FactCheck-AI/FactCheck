I saw this picture in the 60s quite often at the Thursday night film presentations at Frankfurt (Germany) University. Actually I thought to remember a color film, but IMDb mentions that it is a black and white film. Whenever they screened it I went to see it. I don't exactly remember what it was all about and why it was called the somehow red curtain.

I think someone died while making love. But I don't even remember whether it was a man or lovely Anouk Aime. I am sure that there was no use of the Schufftan process because it definitely was a chamber play and no outdoor action. Alexandre Astruc (one of the many fathers of the NEW WAVE in France) was directing with great elegance and Eugen Schufftan,who had shot PEOPLE on Sunday in Berlin before he emigrated to Hollywood, did great lighting work. Well, just after the war no one in France had money to buy Kodak color stock, so I guess I saw a fine romantic 'colorful' picture in black and White and I probably just loved to see Anouk over and over again.
