This clip was uploaded by the wonderful Soap Opera University that maintain wonderful YouTube Channels and a website. In this clip from SoapNet we get a behind the scenes look at GusH sometime in the early to mid-2000s. It features Beth Ehlers (Harley Cooper #1) and Ricky Paull Goldin (Gus Aitoro #1).

“When Gus revs up his Harley.” That’s a great line! This is a nice depiction of GusH. GusH was a highlight of later years of the show. It’s nice that Beth makes up stuff about their relationship, their favorite restaurant, etc. This was a nice behind the scenes peek.

However, as a Manny fan, Gus was pretty awful especially at the beginning. Gus wasn’t polite at all. Here he’s in Rick’s family home making a move on Rick’s kid’s mom. He also invited himself to the Bauer cabin even though Manny & Rick hate him & it’s THEIR cabin. (Sorry, every time I watch those clip I think what’s he think he’s doing there?) He couldn’t wait to hit on Harley until she was at the diner or at work? She was ALWAYS at the diner or at work.
