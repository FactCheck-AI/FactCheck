In the autumn of 2006, Marvel matched Archie meets the Punisher for sheer crossover weirdness by joining forces with long-running soap opera The Guiding Light. Series regular Harley Cooper (Beth Ehlers) acquired temporary superpowers, started calling herself "The Guiding Light," and adopted the requisite bizarre outfit. No Marvel characters appeared on the show (though, since it was a Halloween episode, their costumes did), but Harley, husband Gus Aitoro (Ricky Paull Goldin), and other series characters met Spider-man, Wolverine, and other superheroes in a special comic story, which appeared in a handful of Marvel titles in November, 2006.
