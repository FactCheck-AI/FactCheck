Dick Tracy is one of those 1990s curiosities which seems to have been forgotten in the mists of time. If you’re young, you might not even know it exists. However, in the summer of 1990 Warren Beatty‘s movie was everywhere. Based on the Chester Gould’s comic strip, it was a big-budget action-adventure musical featuring Beatty in the lead role opposite Madonna and a host of stars including Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman.

Here’s the IMDB synopsis:

The comic strip detective finds his life vastly complicated when Breathless Mahoney makes advances towards him while he is trying to battle Big Boy Caprice’s united mob.

On a budget of around $45 million, Dick Tracy grossed over $103 million at the US box office and $162 million worldwide. It was a solid hit, but something of a disappointment considering that Disney was hoping that it would be the next Batman.

Above is an image of Warren Beatty and Madonna on the set of Dick Tracy (and boy does the film have great sets). Beatty and Madonna were in a relationship during the film’s production and that somewhat overshadowed the film during its release. The documentary Truth or Dare/In Bed with Madonna didn’t help either.
