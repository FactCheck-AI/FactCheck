Gil Grissom (William Petersen) meets Nick's kidnapper with the demanded ransom of one million dollars cash, and the man surprisingly blows himself up without revealing the location of Nick. Without any lead but the thumb of the criminal, the CSI team discloses his identity and the reason for such act of desperation. Fighting against time, the investigators give their best effort trying to locate Nick.

"Grave Danger Volume 2" is a very disappointing sequel, with an awful conclusion. Quentin Tarantino, as usual, uses clich√©s and the ideas of other successful movie in his stories, but the way Nick is rescued from the casket with the explosives beneath is ridiculous, without any fragment reaching his body. "No Man's Land" (2001) seriously shows how impossible it is to remove an object over a bouncing mine. The meeting of Nick with Kelly Gordon is shameful and purposeless. My vote is five.

Title (Brazil): "Perigo a Sete Palmos" ("Danger Six Feet Under")
