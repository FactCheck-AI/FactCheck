GEM: Interview with Ali Selim, Director of Sweet Land?

In episode 29 I told you about a wonderful movie that I saw recently called Sweet Land . It's a film about Norwegian immigrants in rural Minnesota following WWI. I feel so passionate about it not only because it's about family history, but because it's such a rare thing to find a gem like this that you can watch with your entire family.

Ali's Grandparents William and Sophie Niemeier of Minnesota.

This week I had a chance to talk to Ali Selim, award-winning director of Sweet Land, and we chatted about his immigrant parents, the power of memories and some of the terrific actors that he features in the film.
