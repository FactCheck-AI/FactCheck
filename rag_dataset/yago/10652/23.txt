The book contains interviews with “Captain Khorshid” director Nasser Taqvaii, which were conducted by film critic and documentarian Hamid Talebinejad, the Persian service of MNA reported on Saturday.

Taqvaii, who is famous for his ingenious style, has talked about himself and others in a respectful manner, Talebinejad had earlier said about the book, the first edition of which was published in 1990.

“Nasser Taqvaii Narrates” has been re-edited by Taqvaii, and Talebinejad’s interview with Taqvaii about his last production “Blank Paper” has also been added.

In addition, the book covers Taqvaii’s opinions about the major problems of Iran’s cinema.

“I still believe that Iran’s cinema is indebted to Taqvaii, and that familiarizing the youth with his opinions will help broaden their views,” Talebinejad said.

“Tranquility in the Presence of Others” and “The Curse” are among Taqvaii’s other credits.
