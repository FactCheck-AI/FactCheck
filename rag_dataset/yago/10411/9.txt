An Evening with Colin & Deb

Saturday, April 1st @ 7:30PM

All Seats $50

Join Colin Mochrie and Debra McGrath as they talk about their marriage, careers and Deb’s shoes. From the beginning of their relationship (where Deb hired Colin at Second City), to their short lived stay in LA (during the Rodney King incident, OJ, earthquakes, bush fires and floods), to the present day where they have defied the predictions of guests at their wedding. Colin and Debra will talk about how they combined the pleasures of marriage with the pressures of Canadian show biz. With 28 years’ experience in marriage, over 80 years’ combined experience in entertainment and 1 year experience in Instagram, this will be fun and informative.
