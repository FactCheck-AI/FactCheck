With Serenity only a week away Universal Pictures is already nailing down Joss Whedon for yet another feature, Goner.

Whedon wrote and will direct the feature, which will tread on supernatural turf comparable to his series creations “Buffy the Vampire Slayer” and the bloodsucker spin-off “Angel.”

He told Variety, “It’s the story of a young woman’s journey that involves a great deal of horror and some heroics… It’s certainly darker than Serenity, and there are a lot of left turns along the way. It is something I had in mind for a while, and it just poured out of me when I finished my film.”
