Born in Florence, Italy, at the Palazzo Pitti on 26 April 1575, Marie was born Maria, the sixth daughter of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Archduchess Joanna of Austria.

She married Henry IV of France in October 1600 following the annulment of his marriage to Margaret of Valois.

Following the assassination of her husband in 1610, which occurred the day after her coronation, she acted as regent for her son, King Louis XIII of France, until he came of age but her capricious behaviour and dependence on favourites led to her confinement in Blois when Louis assumed royal power in 1617.

Marie continued to intrigue against Louis and her former protégé, Richelieu, who had become the king's adviser, and was subsequently banished to Compiegne, but escaped to Brussels (1631). Her final years were spent in poverty.

She died at Cologne in 1642, scheming against Richelieu to the end. She was buried in the Basilica of St Denis.
