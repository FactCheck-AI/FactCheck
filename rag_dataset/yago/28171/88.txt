Biography

Marie (Medici) de Médicis is Notable.

Marie (Medici) de Médicis has Italian Roots.

Marie de' Medici (French: Marie de Médicis, Italian: Maria de' Medici; 26 April 1575 – 3 July 1642) was Queen of France as the second wife of King Henry IV of France, of the House of Bourbon. Following the assassination of her husband in 1610, the day after her coronation, she acted as regent for her son, King Louis XIII of France, until he came of age.

Born in Florence, Italy, at the Palazzo Pitti on 26 April 1575, Marie was born Maria, the sixth daughter of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany,[3] and Archduchess Joanna of Austria. Marie was one of seven children, but only she and her sister Eleonora survived to adulthood.

She married Henry IV of France in October 1600 following the annulment of his marriage to Margaret of Valois, in Lyon, France. Her eldest son, the future King Louis XIII, was born at Fontainebleau the following year. Marie was crowned Queen of France on 13 May 1610, a day before her husband's death. Marie travelled to Cologne, where she died in 1642. She was buried in the Basilica of St Denis in northern Paris.
