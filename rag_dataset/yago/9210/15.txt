There are cinematographers who do their job adequately, making sure the subject is lit and focused according to the director’s wishes, and then there are the artists, who create perfect frames and perfect shots. These are rare people, and when they are empowered, can produce magical cinema. Gabriel Figueroa (1907-1997) was one of the latter. From the extraordinary vistas of Eisenstein’s QUE VIVA MEXICO (1932), through many Emilio Fernández titles, John Huston’s NIGHT OF THE IGUANA (1964), and Buñuel masterpieces such as THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) and LOS OLVIDADOS (1950), he contributed his expertise, his astonishing technical proficiency, and his unique eye for contrast and shadow.

This Sunday we will present a restoration of the 1943 proto-noir film DISTINTO AMANECER (ANOTHER DAWN), directed by Julio Bracho and shot by Figueroa at the top of his game. Charles Ramírez Berg, noted University Of Texas film professor and author of “The Classical Mexican Cinema: The Poetics of the Exceptional Golden Age Films,” will introduce the film and join us for a post-movie discussion about the work, the era, and, especially Figueroa. The event is copresented by Cine Las Americas.
