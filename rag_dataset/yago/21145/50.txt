Anne was King James II's elder daughter by his first wife, Anne Hyde, daughter of Sir Edward Hyde, who was created Earl of Clarendon in 1661. She was educated as a Protestant. In 1683 she was married to George, Prince of Denmark (1653-1708).

Her father became King in 1685, but was deposed in 1688 by her brother-in-law William, Prince of Orange, who was married to Anne's elder sister Mary. When William and Mary were crowned joint monarchs in 1689, it was agreed that the crown would pass to Anne on their deaths. She became Queen in 1702. Anne's reign is notable for the Act of Union between England and Scotland, passed in 1707.

Although Anne underwent numerous pregnancies, none of her children survived infancy. She was succeeded as monarch by George I, Elector of Hanover (1660-1727).
