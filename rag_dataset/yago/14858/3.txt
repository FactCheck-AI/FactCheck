Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams is to join Anna Friel in a new British film, Me Without You. The story of two best friends growing up in the suburbs of London in the 70s and 80s, the film is written and directed by Sandra Goldbacher, who previously directed Minnie Driver in The Governess. Williams will do a British accent for the first time for the film, which follows the two girls' lives from age 16 to 27. She will fit the project into her schedule by flying between the Dawson's Creek set in North Carolina and the UK. Shooting is set to start in October, with four weeks filming in London and four weeks on the Isle Of Man.
