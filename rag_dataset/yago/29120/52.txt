PrincessÂ Helena Augusta Victoria, Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein by marriage, was not well-placed to land her "Prince Charming." She was also said to be dowdy and have a double chin. She wed Prince Christian from the un-illustrious Schleswig-Holstein family who was fifteen years older than she.Â Her husband's origins pleased Queen Victoria who had them stay in Britain so Helena could help.Â She had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood. One of her sons served in the German Army until World War I, but was excused from fighting the UK by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Another son died of malaria while fighting in the Boer War. Â She died in 1923, unpleasantly estranged from her siblings. Her Wikipedia article is here.

I have seen that these Princesses can be confused with each other. Please notify me of misidentifications.
