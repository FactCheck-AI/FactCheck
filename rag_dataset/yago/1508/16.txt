Met and fell in love with Rex Harrison, who was married at the time, after they appeared together in So etwas lieben die Frauen (1955). Rex learned of Kay's leukemia from her doctor a couple of years later. He divorced Lilli Palmer and married Kay in 1957, agreeing with the doctor never to tell her the reason for her failing health. They lived the good life up until the end.

Her husband Rex Harrison maintained that while he was singing "I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face" in My Fair Lady (1964) he was thinking of her to access his innermost emotion. This is particularly evident in one scene where he sits and looks almost tearful and lost.
