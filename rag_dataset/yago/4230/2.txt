The galaxies have aligned for “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” actress Terry Farrell and Adam Nimoy.

On Saturday, Farrell confirmed she and Nimoy — the son of the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy — are engaged amid Twitter speculation by Trekkies.

“Lol nope Not Fake news!” Farrell replied to one fan, following film critic Scott Mantz’s initial report Friday, in which he exclaimed, “RT BREAKING NEWS!! How’s THIS for #StarTrek ROYALTY?? TERRY FARRELL & ADAM NIMOY are ENGAGED!! May their love & union LLAP!!”

This will be the second marriage for both Farrell and Nimoy, according to E! News. The 53-year-old actress shares a son with her ex-husband Brian Baker, while the 61-year-old filmmaker shares a son and daughter with his former wife Nancy.

The couple made their red carpet debut last year, before hitting a “Star Trek” convention in Las Vegas earlier this month.
