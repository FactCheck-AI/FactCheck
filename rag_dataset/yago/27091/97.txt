Cleese, who signed a deal with Hello! magazine, said: "I couldn't imagine being with anyone but Jenny. And with my record that's a remarkable thing to say."

His new wife is a jewellery designer from Bath. Cleese has previously been married to Connie Booth, Barbara Trentham and Alice Faye Eichelberger who are all from the US.

Cleese's divorce from Eichelberger was a famously expensive one, costing him Â£12 million. He subsequently launched his first solo comedy shows which he named the Alimony Tour.

The comic and actor, who starred in movies such as A Fish Called Wanda, told Hello!: "I never felt there was anything wrong with the institution of marriage - it was my ability to choose the right person."

His bride said: "We're kindred spirits. When people see is together, they immediately get it."
