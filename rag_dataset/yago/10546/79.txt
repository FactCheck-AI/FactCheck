Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt is all set to start his first film under his own banner. Besides Sanjay himself, the yet untitled film will also star Ajay Devgan and will be directed by David Dhawan.

Incidentally David's first film as a director, Taaqatwar (1989), had Sanjay playing the lead and now Sanjay's first film as a producer will be directed by David.

Says David: “Sanju gave me a break when I made Taaqatwar. He is like my family and we have had a long standing association. We have already finalised Ajay for the film and we are looking for one more lead star. I was also actively involved in as many as ten of Sanjay's films as an editor before I made Taaqatwar. I am so happy to be directing Sanju's first production.”

Dharam Oberoi, CEO, Sanjay Dutt Productions said, “The film will be made in association with Rupali Om Entertainment which is Bharat Shah's company and will go on the floors in October this year.”
