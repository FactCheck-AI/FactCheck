Knuth is probably best known for his three-volume work, The Art of Computer Programming, which popularized the analysis of algorithms as a basic tool of computer science.

Knuth is responsible for the theory of LR parsing, which he invented in a 1965 article.

Knuth is the recipient of many awards, including the 1974 Turing award (computer science's highest award).

In his spare time, Knuth enjoys playing the pipe organ.
