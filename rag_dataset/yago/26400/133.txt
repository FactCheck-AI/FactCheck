Alan Alda really is that cliche "star of stage and screen." He adds playwright to that list with his latest endeavor, Radiance: The Passion of Marie Curie, now at the Geffen Playhouse. Alda, whose screenplays include The Seduction of Joe Tynan and Sweet Liberty, is also a long-time science buff, previously hosting Scientific American Frontiers on PBS, and starring as the physicist Richard Feynman in the play QED on Broadway. He also appears in Universal's Tower Heist, now in theaters.
