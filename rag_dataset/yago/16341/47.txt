Patricia Hughes, the former First Lady of Maryland, has died at age 79.

Her death was announced today by ex-Governor Harry Hughes, who had been associated in recent years with the C.V. Starr Center at Washington College.

Mrs. Hughes died after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease. She is survived by her husband and their two daughters, Ann and Elizabeth.

Educated at the Sorbonne and Bryn Mawr College, Mrs. Hughes was a teacher who worked, while serving as first lady in the 1980s, to restore the governor’s mansion. The Hughes had been living in recent years in Denton, Md.

In a statement, Gov. Martin O’Malley said, “Her life and legacy serving her family and our state touched the lives of thousands of Marylanders and reminds us all that a life lived for others is the greatest of gifts.”
