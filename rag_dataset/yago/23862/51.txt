Through her sister, Marie Louise, she was a sister-in-law of Napoleon I of France; through Maria Leopoldina a sister-in-law of Peter I of Brazil; through Marie Caroline a sister-in-law of Frederick Augustus II of Saxony.

Maria Clementina was married, 28 July, 1816, at Schönbrunn Palace, Vienna, to her mother's younger brother, Prince Leopoldo of the Two Sicilies, Prince of Salerno, the youngest son of King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Archduchess Maria Carolina of Austria.

Three of the couple's four children died in their first year: Prince Ludovico (1824-1824) and two infants.

They had a surviving daughter, Princess Maria Carolina Augusta of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1822-1869), who on 25 November, 1844, in Naples, married her paternal first cousin, Prince Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale (1822-1897). Henri was the fourth (and second-youngest) surviving son of King Louis Philippe I of France and his wife Princess Marie-Amelie of the Two Sicilies.

Through their daughter, Maria Clementina and Leopoldo had four grandchildren, two of whom reached adulthood:

* Louis Philippe Marie Léopold, Prince de Condé (1845&ndash;1866)

* François Louis d'Orléans, Duc de Guise (1854&ndash;1872)

However, neither of these grandchildren married or produced children of their own.

Maria Clementina died 3 September 1881 at the Chateau de Chantilly, France, the home of her widowed son-in-law Duke Henry. She was eighty-three years old; all her descendants having predeceased her.
