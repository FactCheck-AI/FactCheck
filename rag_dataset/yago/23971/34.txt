25.“It's my shit!”

Production: You So Crazy

Year: 1994

Character: Himself

We will never look at Andy Griffin in the same way.

24.“There's a lot of lyte at the end of that tunnel boy!”

Production: Def Comedy Jam

Year:

Character: Himself

You can't go to a comedy show and not expect to get clowned. A little joking is expected, but Todd 1 of Yo! MTV Raps wasn't ready. Between the chair slide and the walk away, it's safe to say Martin's jab connected.

23.“That's some good neck.”

Production: Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat

Year: 2002

Character: Himself

Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat was Lawrence's stand-up performance following You So Crazy. Eight years had passed and Martin used it as an opportunity to catch his fans up on some of the headlines that had surrounded him. Two minutes into his routine and Martin proved he still had heat. For the record, no one likes those smoking commercials.

22.“Rodney kept getting up because that's how black people are.”

Production: You So Crazy

Year: 1994

Character: Himself

Martin Lawrence came out of the gate swinging. His first major film, You So Crazy solidified his spot in a long line of comedians. His jokes were well received by the New York City crowd, touching on everything from relationships to race. Just one year after Rodney King's beating sparked the L.A. riots, leave it to Martin to crack a joke while racial tensions were high.

21.“Look at the white shoes!”

Production: Martin

Year: 1993

Character: Jerome

Jerome, the International Playa from the Himalayas, had a thing for ladies with “junk in the trunk,” and Pam was stuck in his crosshairs. Equipped with the curls, gold teeth and limp, Jerome had all the making of a ladies man but his game fell flat with Pam. Known for his footwork, Jerome's entrances were noteworthy.

20.“That ain't no damn puppy!”

Production: Martin “The Romantic Weekend”

Year: 1995

Character: Martin Payne

There weren't many times that Pam and Martin weren't at each other's throats, but this episode goes down in the history books. After a weekend on Chilligan Island goes to the shitter, Pam and Martin team up in an all out brawl when an unwanted critter keeps popping up in their room. The tag team beat-down the frenemies give the resilient rodent was enough to crack a smile on the most stoic of faces.

19.“You know you're in love when…”

Production: You So Crazy

Year: 1994

Character: Himself

Martin basically just wants women to be savages. What would Sheneneh do?

18.“Can I have a kiss?”

Production: Martin, “Guard Your Grill”

Year: 1994

Character: Martin Payne

Martin may have been on the receiving end of a slew of short jokes, but no one could deny the size of his ego until one day he wrote a check his ass couldn't cash. Challenged to getting inside the ring with famed boxer Thomas Hearns, Martin got humbled—real quick.

17.“Big Momma, what's that?”

Production: Big Momma's House

Year: 2000

Character: Malcom/Big Momma

FBI agent Malcolm Turner has more than a few tricks up his sleeves when he poses as Big Momma in an attempt to lure a jail escapee back behind bars. His disguise is foolproof until he catches himself spooning Nia Long. Can you blame him?

16.“All eyes on me.”

Production: Martin

Year: 1995

Character: Dragonfly Jones

Dragonfly Jones may not have had a reoccurring role as frequent as Sheneneh, Jerome or Roscoe, but when he appeared on Martin, he made it count. The energetic martial arts enthusiast never caught the W. But you had to give him an A for effort.

15.“Where's the umbilical cord?”

Production: Martin, “Baby, It's You”

Year: 1993

Character: Martin Payne

FOX had a hit on their hands when they added Martin to their arsenal of programming. The five-season sitcom detailed the relationship of Martin and Gina, including their clique Pam, Tommy, and Cole. The group often found themselves in extreme predicaments, providing America with some of the most memorable comedic performances of the '90s. “Baby, It's You” is one of those classic Martin episodes that stuck with the diehard fans over the two decades since the show's premiere. The best part: “Dammit Tommy! We don't need an umbilical cord. This is TV!”

14.“You ever made love to a man?”

Production: Bad Boys 2

Year: 2003

Character: Marcus Burnett

The interrogation between a father and his daughter's date is usually one that has high levels of intimidation, but the scare tactics are ten times as high when the girl you're taking out has a father for a cop. Even though Marcus was known for being the more emotional one of the Bad Boys duo, Reggie had no idea what he was getting himself into. Martin brought the realness in efforts to protect his daughter, but Will came through with the assist and brought it home.

13.“My man loves me!”

Production: You So Crazy

Year: 1994

Character: Himself

Get out your pen and paper and take notes from Ol' Marty Mar.

12.Best of Martin & Pam

Production: Martin

Year: 1992-1997

Character: Martin Payne

It's almost impossible to think of Martin's reign on television and ignore the epic battles between the two most important people in Gina's life. The clash between Pam and Martin made for amazing television. Although Martin and Gina had amazing chemistry, Pam and Martin were a close second with their ability to roast each other to no end.

11.“You gotta go to work on Myra's feet!”

Production: Martin, “Control”

Year: 1993

Character: Sheneneh Jenkins

The beef between Gina, Pam and Martin's neighbor Sheneneh Jenkins was anything but hospitable. The interactions were just the right blend of cattiness and humor, but never crossed the line of course because Sheneneh prided herself on being a lady. As Gina tries to take a walk in Sheneneh's shoes, Ms. Jenkins proves that she's more than acrylic nails and hair extensions.

10.“Hurry up!”

Production: Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat

Year: 2002

Character: Himself

The clap back was so effortless.

9.“I wasn't ready!”

Production: Def Comedy Jam

Year: 1992

Character: Himself

Music mogul Russell Simmons took his talents to the comedic route when he produced Def Comedy Jam and named Martin as the host. The HBO television series was raw and uncut, launching the career of black comedians that graced the stage. Hitting the stage in nothing but his underwear was a pretty ballsy move—no pun intended.

8.“Stop. Think about it.”

Production: Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat

Year: 2002

Character: Himself

No one's arguing with Martin on this one, but if the Cha Cha Slide came on right now you'd still Charlie Brown.

7.“My ass still hurts from what you did to it the other night.”

Production: Bad Boys 2

Year: 2003

Character: Marcus Burnett

Just one installment of Bad Boys would not suffice, so when the sequel hit the big screen in 2003 fans rejoiced. Almost a decade later, the two actors were seemingly maturing in different ways. Their on-screen growing pains created even larger laughing fits, and this scene displayed just how comfortable the two were within their bromance. Lawrence confirmed the development of Bad Boys 3 when he hit Conan saying that the script is in the works.

6.“Nonviolent, nonviolent.”

Production: Martin Lawrence Live: Runteldat

Year: 2002

Character: Himself

Martin Lawrence as Martin Luther King Jr. It's almost scary to imagine MLK according to Lawrence's wishes. But Martin asks the question that many have asked as they've sat through history lectures.

5.“Oh my, this is heavy.”

Production: Martin, “Gots to Be There”

Year: 1993

Character: Martin Payne

Of course Gina only had eyes for Martin, but in true Martin fashion, he felt the need to catch bae slipping. A crossbreed between his skit on the “crazy and deranged” in You So Crazy and Dragonfly Jones, Martin served up a dose of delusion when he tried to catch his woman in a tryst with another man. You also can't watch this scene without giving props to Martin and Luis Ramos for the obvious improv.

4.“Let me feel your nose.”

Production: Def Comedy Jam

Year: 1992

Character: Himself

Even the King of Pop wasn't exempt from Martin's trajectory.

3.“Crazy, deranged”

Production: You So Crazy

Year: 1994

Character: Himself

If anyone comes to get you at the club in a onesie, you've got a grade-A stalker on your hands.

2.“Always and forever.”

Production: House Party

Year: 1990

Character: Bilal

Before the kids of Project X, the award for the most epic house party goes to Kid 'n Play. Lawrence played Bilal, the DJ who was always getting clowned by the hip-hop duo. Shoutout to the thirst in this clip. Homegirl was over it before it even began.

1.“Freeze bitch!”

Production: Bad Boys

Year: 1995

Character: Marcus Burnett

What do you get when you make a film starring two kings of situational comedies in the '90s? Bad Boys was the answer for everyone who couldn't choose whether Martin or The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reigned supreme. We followed Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett through their efforts to seize drugs from the mafia in Miami. The natural chemistry between the two actors made for a bevy of belly bursting moments, but “and some skittles” really puts the cherry on top of their delivery.
