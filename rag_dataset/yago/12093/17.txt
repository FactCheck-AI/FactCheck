Port Charles and General Hospital actor Brian Presley, 29, and his wife Erin Hershey Presley, 30, are expecting their first child together. No due date given, but Access Hollywood claims Erin to be "heavily pregnant" so a birth announcement wonâ€™t be far. According to CBB reader Carrie, their registry lists the January birth of a boy. The couple married in 2002, after co-starring in Port Charles.
