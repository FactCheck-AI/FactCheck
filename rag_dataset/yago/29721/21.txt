Biography

Vratislav was born sometime between 1032 and 1035 as the son of Břetislav I of Bohemia and Judith von Schweinfurt. [1] He followed his brother Spytihněv II of Bohemia as Vratislav II, duke of Bohemia in 1061. In 1085 or 1086 he was crowned king of Bohemia as Vratislav I by Heinrich IV.[2][3]

Vratislav II had a first wife whose name is not known,[4][5] although Charles Cawley calls her Maria without giving a source.[6] There are speculations in the Czech literature that she was German. When Vratislav had to flee to Hungary from his brother Spytihněv she remained in Olomouc/Olmütz due to her advanced pregnancy. She was never-the-less imprisoned by Spytihněv and subsequently died from complications of a premature birth.[7]

In 1057 Vratislav married Adelhaid of Hungary.[8][9] After her death in 1062 he married Svatava of Poland.[8]

Vratislav died in 1092 after a fall from his horse while hunting.[10][11]
